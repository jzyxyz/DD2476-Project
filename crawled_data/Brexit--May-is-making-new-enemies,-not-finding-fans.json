{"title": "Brexit: May is making new enemies, not finding fans", "content": "This is not - I repeat NOT - a re-run of the referendum. \nTheresa May will never convince purists on either side of the Brexit debate that they are wrong to believe it's right to leave, or heresy to argue to stay. \nWhat she needs to do is get enough of her colleagues to accept they can't have everything they desire, but that there is enough in her compromise to say yes to an arrangement that fulfils the Tories' political promises. \nSo far, however, her arguments don't seem to be holding much sway. The tally of Tory MPs who've declared they're willing to vote against is rising - irrespective of whether the public detests or ignores the circus. \nWith less than a week to go, despite the prime minister's private meetings with dozens of backbenchers, they are not emerging convinced. \nIf anything, her compromise seems to be making new enemies, not finding new fans. \nAnd fresh from a trio of defeats, Mrs May seems to be arguing the case with diminishing authority. \nA tentative hunt for changes that could peel rebels away seems fruitless so far. \nJust when the prime minister needs goodwill, respect and trust, it is in very short supply.  \nOne senior Tory told me: \"She doesn't listen to anyone, so why should we.\"  ", "date": "5 December 2018", "href": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46461634", "tags": "brexit needs may minister seems making compromise prime finding tory enemies fans new far enough"}
