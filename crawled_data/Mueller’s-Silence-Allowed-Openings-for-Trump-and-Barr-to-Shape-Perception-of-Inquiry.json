{"title": "Mueller\u2019s Silence Allowed Openings for Trump and Barr to Shape Perception of Inquiry", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A sport utility vehicle with tinted windows sped into the freight garage of the office of Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, just after 7 on Thursday morning \u2014 almost to the minute when he typically arrives \u2014 concealing to photographers what was likely his arrival on the day his report was finally made public.\nLess than an hour later, President Trump greeted the world in a much more attention-eliciting way: \u201cPRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT,\u201d he shouted in a tweet.\nThe contrast underscored the risks of Mr. Mueller\u2019s nearly two-year silence as head of the Russia investigation. By not speaking publicly, he insulated his office from credible accusations of leaks and evaded Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on the inquiry, burnishing Mr. Mueller\u2019s image as an apolitical arbiter supervising the most politically consequential investigation in a generation. But he also allowed Mr. Trump \u2014 and more recently, Attorney General William P. Barr \u2014 to shape public expectations for his own work.\nMr. Barr held a news conference without Mr. Mueller just before the publication of the report, defending the president and asserting his power as the investigation\u2019s ultimate authority.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a report he did for me,\u201d Mr. Barr said defiantly to a reporter who asked why Mr. Mueller was not present. \u201cI\u2019m here to discuss my response to that report and my decision, entirely discretionary, to make it public.\u201d\nMr. Barr also came under scrutiny again over a four-page letter he wrote last month outlining the investigation\u2019s main findings. He departed in significant ways from the special counsel team\u2019s conclusions, the 448-page report revealed. Some members of Mr. Mueller\u2019s team have complained that Mr. Barr failed to accurately portray their work.\n\u201cBarr took advantage of the fact that he knew or assumed, correctly, that Mueller wasn\u2019t going to leak on him,\u201d said Peter R. Zeidenberg, a deputy special counsel during the 2007 trial of I. Lewis Libby Jr., Vice President Dick Cheney\u2019s former chief of staff who was convicted of lying in an investigation over the leak of a C.I.A. officer\u2019s identity. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have happened had he been afraid Mueller would speak up.\u201d\nA spokesman for the special counsel\u2019s office declined to comment, and a spokeswoman for Mr. Barr pointed to his comments at Thursday\u2019s news conference.\nMr. Trump exploited Mr. Mueller\u2019s silence, stepping in to characterize the investigation as a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and taunt Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigators as \u201cangry Democrats\u201d avenging his election upset. On Friday, Mr. Trump continued his Twitter assault, describing the report as \u201ccrazy\u201d as he attacked the prosecutors.\nWhen Senate Democrats asked Mr. Barr in a budget hearing this month whether Mr. Mueller was indeed leading what Mr. Trump has called a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d Mr. Barr demurred. \u201cIf you are somebody who\u2019s being falsely accused of something, you would tend to view the investigation as a witch hunt,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWhat Barr did was try to take advantage of knowing that Mueller was playing things square and by the book,\u201d said Joyce Vance, a former United States attorney in Alabama. \u201cMueller did things the right way, and there is undoubtedly a cost for that.\u201d\nMs. Vance said that during the Watergate investigation, younger prosecutors on the team were encouraged to give interviews to help engender the public\u2019s faith in the inquiry. Mr. Mueller was strict about his prosecutors not speaking, his lawyers careful not to say anything about the investigation when approached by reporters.\nMr. Mueller\u2019s instincts were a departure from those of Ken Starr, the independent counsel who investigated President Bill Clinton. Mr. Starr gave interviews and speeches while prosecuting the case, once holding an impromptu news conference in his front yard to defend the scope and speed of his investigation and compare himself to Sgt. Joe Friday from the television series \u201cDragnet.\u201d\nMr. Mueller stayed silent, growing into an almost mythological figure in Washington, as a public hungry for clues about his investigation scrutinized his body language and documented chance sightings. Photographers gathered last week outside a restaurant he frequented during the investigation. His patronage recently revealed, he never showed.\nThe report itself \u2014 dense in both language and layout \u2014 reflected Mr. Mueller\u2019s caution and stood in contrast to Mr. Starr\u2019s more conversational and discursive style. The section on episodes of possible obstruction unfolds in devastating chronological detail but avoids commenting on the powerful political context.\n\u201cLofty prose is not his thing,\u201d said Glenn Kirschner, who worked for Mr. Mueller in the homicide unit of the United States attorney\u2019s office in Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be almost terse.\u201d\nThe report also refers to \u201cour investigation\u201d and \u201cour analysis,\u201d reminders that a team of prosecutors, not Mr. Mueller alone, conducted the 22-month inquiry and composed the lengthy document.\nEven with the team itself, Mr. Mueller remained somewhat apart. As he set up the special counsel\u2019s office in 2017, he relied on Beth McGarry, a former deputy to Mr. Mueller when he was the United States attorney in San Francisco, to vet candidates, secure funding and find office space, according to a former federal law enforcement official. He had several of his top prosecutors interview top candidates before they met with him.\nDuring the inquiry, his longtime aide Aaron Zebley, a prosecutor on the team, took the lead in dealing with Ed O\u2019Callaghan, a senior Justice Department official helping monitor the investigation, two government officials said. Mr. Mueller often sat in briefly in major interviews or stopped in briefly to thank witnesses for coming in, but rarely asked questions himself. Mr. Mueller never appeared in court during the investigation, and one of his prosecutors, Michael R. Dreeben, issued legal arguments defending the prerogative of the work.\nAt a sentencing of Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, nearly every prosecutor and agent who had worked for Mr. Mueller gathered in the courtroom to take in what would be the last major public proceeding of the investigation, including Mr. Zebley and James L. Quarles III, Mr. Mueller\u2019s top two deputies. Mr. Mueller was absent.\nTo be sure, Mr. Mueller participated directly in the investigation that has come to bear his name. In his news conference, Mr. Barr described a March 5 meeting in which the special counsel repeatedly affirmed he would not make a final call on whether to charge Mr. Trump with obstructing justice.\n\u201cHe made it clear that he had not made the determination that there was a crime,\u201d Mr. Barr told reporters.\nMr. Mueller might soon talk in public for the first time since his appointment. The House Judiciary and Intelligence Committees have both invited him to testify next month. Judiciary Committee aides were in discussions with the Justice Department about a potential hearing, a spokesman said on Friday.\nOn the last page of the report, before the appendix, the word \u201cwe\u201d appears seven times in Mr. Mueller\u2019s final conclusion justifying his decision not to charge Mr. Trump.\n\u201cBecause we determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment,\u201d prosecutors wrote, \u201cwe did not draw ultimate conclusions.\u201d\nThe rest of the page is blank. Where Mr. Starr printed his name at the end of his report, Mr. Mueller left white space.", "date": "April 19, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/19/us/politics/mueller-silence.html", "tags": "report inquiry investigation silence perception allowed openings trump \u201d shape barr said \u2014 mueller"}
