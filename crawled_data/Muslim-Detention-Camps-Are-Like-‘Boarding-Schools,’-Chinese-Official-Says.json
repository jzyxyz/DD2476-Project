A United States envoy called it part of a \u201cwar with faith.\u201d Turkey, once quiet about the detentions, has become critical. The United Nations high commissioner for human rights recently demanded answers.\nYet at the annual meeting of China\u2019s national legislature, which began last month, Communist Party officials from Xinjiang appeared serenely unbowed about the policies.\nForeign experts, citing satellite images and government documents, have estimated that the camps have held without trial as many as a million Uighurs, Kazakhs and other Muslims in a program that tries to turn them into loyal, Chinese-speaking supporters of the party.\nIn a meeting room jammed with foreign and Chinese journalists, the chairman of the Xinjiang government, Shohrat Zakir, dismissed that estimate, but did not say how many inmates they held.\n\u201cSome voices internationally have said Xinjiang has concentration camps or re-education camps. These claims are pure lies,\u201d Mr. Zakir said at the gathering of Xinjiang delegates of the Communist Party-controlled legislature, the National People\u2019s Congress, which was opened to journalists.\n\u201cIn fact, our centers are like boarding schools where the students eat and live for free,\u201d Mr. Zakir said, using their official name, \u201ceducational training centers.\u201d\nHe indicated that the camps could eventually be phased out, but did not say how long that might take.\n\u201cOver all, the education training centers will have fewer and fewer people, and if one day society doesn\u2019t need them, these centers can gradually disappear,\u201d Mr. Zakir said.\nSince last year, Mr. Zakir, a Uighur, has served as one of the government\u2019s most prominent defenders of Beijing\u2019s offensive against Islamic religious activities and ethnic dissent in Xinjiang. In October, he was the first Chinese official to defend in detail the mass detentions.\nAdrian Zenz, a lecturer at the European School of Culture and Theology in Germany whose research concluded that the indoctrination camps in Xinjiang could hold a million or more inmates, said that the facilities worked under at least eight names, and not just the training centers that Mr. Zakir mentioned.\n\u201cIn my view, it might well be as high as 1.5 million,\u201d he said of the population held for indoctrination. \u201cThere is virtually no Uighur family without one or more members in such detention, and a rising number of Kazakhs and other Muslim minorities are likewise affected.\u201d\nMr. Zakir\u2019s latest remarks underscored how the Chinese government has been unmoved by the global criticism of its policies, and confident that its propaganda drive of closely supervised visits to Xinjiang by selected diplomats and journalists could blunt the condemnation.\nThe press event on Tuesday was part of that propaganda effort. Held in the Xinjiang room at the imposing Great Hall of the People, the gathering featured around 60 officials, including some from the Uighur, Hui, Tatar and Mongolian ethnic minorities, sitting before a floor-to-ceiling painting of a snowy mountain scene from the region.\nOver the nearly two-hour session, the officials took turns to praise China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, and the party\u2019s drive to eradicate poverty, invigorate the local economy and attract tourists to the region. They often invoked the pomegranate, the multi-seeded fruit that the government treats as a symbol of ethnic harmony.\nOne official described how policies to improve waste sorting and install modern toilets had helped transform a village.\n\u201cOur lives are getting better day by day,\u201d said Chen Liang, the local official. \u201cFor all of these good things, we really have to thank Xi Jinping and the party.\u201d\nSuch arguments resonate with many Chinese people but were unlikely to stem the global criticism, which has drawn on accounts from former camp inmates and extensive research documenting how hundreds of detention camps have expanded across Xinjiang since 2017.\nThe Uighurs are a Turkic people who share traditions and language traits with Islamic populations across Central Asia and Turkey. Last month, the Turkish Foreign Ministry accused China of the \u201creintroduction of concentration camps in the 21st century\u201d and called policies in Xinjiang a violation of the \u201cfundamental human rights\u201d of Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims.\nThe Turkish foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, kept up the criticism later in February.\n\u201cWhile recognizing China\u2019s right to combat terrorism, we think that a distinction should be made between terrorists and innocent people,\u201d Mr. Cavusoglu said at a meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva.\nMichelle Bachelet,  the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, said she wanted independent access to investigate reports of \u201cenforced disappearances and arbitrary detentions,\u201d especially in Xinjiang.\nSam Brownback, the United States\u2019 ambassador at large for international religious freedom, has been much blunter. \u201cWe need to call these camps what they are; they\u2019re internment camps created to wipe out the cultural and religious identity of minority communities,\u201d Mr. Brownback told journalists in Hong Kong last week.\nBut in a possible sign of China\u2019s influence, some activists abroad who have denounced the internments in Xinjiang have come under growing pressure.\nSerikzhan Bilash, the founder of an organization in Kazakhstan that helps ethnic Kazakhs who have fled neighboring Xinjiang, was detained on Sunday in Almaty.\nHe was placed under house arrest for two months in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan, and was being investigated on suspicion of \u201cinciting ethnic hatred,\u201d his lawyer, Aiman Umarova, said by telephone.\nIn Beijing, Chen Quanguo, the Communist Party secretary of Xinjiang, remained mostly silent in the presence of reporters. Mr. Chen is the chief enforcer of tough policies in the region, but he let Mr. Zakir do most of the talking. The Xinjiang police often follow and restrict foreign journalists who visit the region, but Mr. Chen struck a different note in his brief opening comments.\n\u201cI express my sincere thanks to Chinese and foreign reporters for their longstanding interest in Xinjiang,\u201d Mr. Chen said.", "date": "March 12, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/world/asia/china-xinjiang.html", "tags": "\u2018 mr. boarding xinjiang china \u201d schools official muslim chinese camps says detention zakir foreign government like"}
