{"title": "Nice attack: What we know about the Bastille Day killings", "content": "Dozens of people were killed, including children, when a lorry ploughed into a large crowd watching a fireworks display in Nice to mark the Bastille Day holiday. \nThe driver also fired shots, before being killed by police. This is what we know about what happened.\nThe driver of the lorry was identified as  Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel, a 31-year-old Tunisian man.\nParis prosecutor Francois Molins says Lahouaiej-Bouhlel was divorced with three children. His ex-wife was taken into custody along with four other people believed to be linked to him. A flat he lived in near Nice railway station was searched by police. \nLahouaiej-Bouhlel was \"totally unknown\" to security services, and investigations are continuing into whether he acted alone, Mr Molins said. \nLahouaiej-Bouhlel is said to have hired the lorry from a rental company in Saint-Laurent-du-Var, a town to the west of Nice, on 11 July. He had been due to return it on 13 July.\nPolice said that, at the time of the attack, Lahouaiej-Bouhlel was in possession of an automatic pistol, bullets, a fake automatic pistol and two replica assault rifles (a Kalashnikov and an M16), an empty grenade. Also in the lorry with him were a driving licence and a bank card.\nWho was the Nice attacker?\nEighty-six people were killed, all but three of them at the time of the attack. The dead included 10 children and teenagers.\nA total of 303 people were taken to hospital for medical treatment. A man who was badly injured in the assault died on 4 August, taking the total number of those killed to 85.\nIn the hours after the attacks, worried relatives posted images on social media of the missing. \nAmong the dead was Fatima Charrihi, whose son said she was the first to die. \nAnother victim, according to reports, was the assistant head of the Nice border police, Jean-Marc Leclerc.\nAn American 11-year-old boy, Brodie Copeland, and his father, Sean, were also killed. They had been on holiday in Nice.\nThree people on a school trip from Germany were unaccounted for. \nRead more about the victims\nFrench security officials are still assessing whether the driver of a truck was working alone or in a group.\nSo-called Islamic State later claimed one of its followers carried out the attack.\nA news agency linked to the group, Amaq Agency, said: \"He did the attack in response to calls to target the citizens of the coalition that is fighting the Islamic State.\"\nOfficials said it bore the hallmark of a terrorist organisation.\nPresident Hollande said it was \"an attack whose terrorist nature cannot be denied\".\nMr Molins said the attack was \"in line with the constant calls to kill\" from militant Islamist groups, and the investigation would be seek to find out whether Lahouaiej-Bouhlel had ties to Islamist militants. \nFrench Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said Lahouaiej-Bouhlel seemed to have been \"radicalised very quickly\".\nAnti-terrorist prosecutors in Paris have launched an inquiry for murder and attempted murder as part of an organised terrorist strike. \nFrance's DGSI internal security organisation warned of the danger of further attacks from Islamist militants with \"booby-trapped vehicles and bombs\".\nThe so-called Islamic State has targeted France on several occasions since January 2015.\nOnly hours before the Nice attack, President Hollande had announced that France's state of emergency would be removed later this month. After the attack in Nice he announced it was being extended.\nThe terror began a little after 22:30 (20:30 GMT) on 14 July, shortly after thousands of people had watched a firework display on the seafront.\nThere had been a mood of celebration and the crowd had enjoyed an air force display. Families strolled along the city's renowned Promenade des Anglais.\nA large white lorry was seen driving erratically a couple of streets away from the seafront promenade. \"He was speeding up, braking, speeding up again and braking again. We thought it was weird,\" said Laicia Baroi. She described how the lorry then turned on to the promenade heading south-west towards the airport.\nBut it was not for another half hour before the attack began. A German journalist saw events unfold from a hotel balcony, as the lorry doubled back from the direction of the airport, breaching the barriers erected on the promenade opposite the Lenval children's hospital.\n\"He was driving really slowly, that's what was astonishing,\" said Richard Gutjahr, who described seeing the lorry being tailed by a motorcyclist. \"The motorcyclist tried to overtake him and even tried opening the lorry driver's door,\" he told AFP news agency. At that point the motorcyclist fell under the wheels of the lorry.\nWhen two police officers opened fire on the lorry, the driver accelerated and careered at full speed towards the crowd.\nThe vehicle mounted the kerb then went back on the road, zigzagging for up to 2km (1.25 miles), as the driver deliberately drove into people. \nA local MP spoke of hundreds of people being run over. Others scrambled to safety, on to the beach or into nearby hotels.\n\"I was opposite the Palais de la Mediterranee [hotel] when I saw a lorry at high speed running over people. I saw it with my own eyes, people tried to stop it,\" said one witness.\nPolice finally managed to bring the lorry to a halt near the luxury hotel. \nParis Prosecutor Francois Molins says the driver fired repeatedly on three policemen, who returned fire and pursued him for hundreds of metres.\nMobile phone footage appeared to show the moment the driver was shot.\nImages from the scene showed the windscreen and front of the lorry raked with bullets. Interior ministry officials later confirmed that the attacker had been \"neutralised\".\nIt soon became clear that many people had died, although the full scale of the disaster was unclear. The dead and injured were taken to the local Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Nice.\nIn the area around Nice, the anti-terror alert was raised to its highest level.\nPresident Francois Hollande was flown back to Paris from a visit to Avignon, joining Prime Minister Manuel Valls in a crisis room. Mr Valls declared three days of mourning. \nThe pair then travelled to Nice, where the interior and health ministers were already involved in crisis meetings with local officials.\nMr Hollande met his defence and security chiefs and cabinet ministers.\nLater, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve called on \"patriotic citizens\" to become reservists to boost security across the country.\nHe also reiterated a pledge made by Mr Hollande to call up France's current squad of reservists, which total some 12,000 volunteers.", "date": "19 August 2016", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-36801671", "tags": "people know lahouaiej-bouhlel bastille nice killings lorry driver police killed three attack day"}
