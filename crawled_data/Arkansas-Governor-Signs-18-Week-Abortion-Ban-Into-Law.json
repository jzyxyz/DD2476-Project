(AP) \u2014 Arkansas\u2019 Republican governor has signed into law a measure banning most abortions 18 weeks into a woman\u2019s pregnancy, enacting one of the strictest prohibitions in the country.\nGov. Asa Hutchinson on Friday signed the measure, which includes exceptions for rape, incest and medical emergencies. Arkansas already bans abortion 20 weeks into a woman\u2019s pregnancy.\nThe ban will take effect 90 days after the Legislature formally adjourns this year\u2019s session, which is expected to occur in May. A nearly identical 18-week ban has been sent to Utah\u2019s Republican governor.\nOther states have sought to enact even stricter bans.\nKentucky\u2019s governor signed legislation Friday banning abortion as early as six weeks, but a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order to block it from taking effect.\nOpponents have said they plan to challenge Arkansas\u2019 ban in court.", "date": "\n03/15/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/arkansas-governor-18-week-abortion-ban-law_n_5c8c544ee4b0db7da9f37355", "tags": "measure arkansas weeks signs woman republican abortion pregnancy governor banning ban law signed"}
