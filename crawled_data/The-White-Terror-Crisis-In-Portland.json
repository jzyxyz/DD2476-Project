{"title": "The White Terror Crisis In Portland", "content": "PORTLAND, Ore.\u00a0\u2015 It\u2019s easy to understand why Imam Mikal Shabazz doesn\u2019t feel like Portland always loves people who look like him.\nHe remembers when cops choked an unarmed black man to death and then distributed T-shirts bragging about it. He lived here when a gang of neo-Nazis brutally murdered an Ethiopian student\u00a0on the street. And he was here during the Northwest Imperative movement, when white supremacists moved to the Pacific Northwest to set up a white Utopia, terrorizing cities like Portland.\n\u201cAll of that wasn\u2019t too long ago in my time, on my calendar,\u201d said Shabazz, 66. Portland, he said, shouldn\u2019t think of that kind of terror as distant history. It\u2019s very much still happening.\nLast Friday, a white supremacist\u00a0stabbed three men on the MAX train, two fatally, as they tried to protect a black teenage girl and her Muslim friend from his bigoted, anti-Muslim threats.\nThe murders grabbed national headlines with many asking: Portland? That liberal, progressive city in a blue state?\nWhat people forget is that Portland is in Oregon, a \u201cwhite state where most white people almost never interact with people of color,\u201d Shabazz said.\n\u201cAt the same time, there\u2019s always been some of us here,\u201d he added, referring to himself and other minorities. \u00a0\nShabazz is an imam at the Muslim Community Center of Portland, which has almost completed a new one-story mosque just a few miles northeast of where the stabbing occurred. On Tuesday afternoon during Ramadan, the Muslim holy month dedicated to fasting and reflection,\u00a0the sounds of construction could be heard inside the mosque as a typical soft Northwest rain fell outside.\nWhen one of the contractors there to install a security system walked through the prayer room with his shoes on \u2015 a no-no at mosques \u2015 one of the parishioners asked him kindly to take them off.\n\u201cI\u2019m not taking them off,\u201d the contractor, a lumbering middle-aged white man, replied sternly.\nShabazz defused the situation, like he always does, and said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. We\u2019ll clean it up. We\u2019ve done it before.\u201d\nPortland, depicted in recent years as a quirky progressive urban Eden \u2015 especially in the TV show \u201cPortlandia\u201d \u2015 has a long history of racism. In the wake of Friday\u2019s murders, America has rediscovered the city as a haven for hate, while local leaders like Shabazz try to reassure a very frightened community.\nOregon\u2019s history reads like a timeline of white supremacy. Its indigenous peoples were massacred. The state\u2019s original constitution had a complete ban on blacks living in the state. It became a home to thousands of KKK members in the 1920s. It was the scene of Japanese-American incarceration during World War II. In the Jim Crow era, whites-only signs adorned storefronts just as they did in the South. This history created conditions ripe for the evolution of a robust neo-Nazi culture in the 1980s and \u201890s.\n\u201cIn the eyes of a skinhead, Portland, Oregon, looks like the city of the future,\u201d Time magazine wrote about the movement in 1993. The article went on to describe the Northwest Imperative, which drew hundreds of white supremacists to the region to found a whites-only city.\u00a0\nEric Ward, a longtime civil rights strategist and program officer for the Ford Foundation, lived in Oregon during this era and later worked with the Northwest Coalition Against Malicious Harassment. He remembers a constant stream of terror back then, he said. Organized neo-Nazi groups repeatedly attacked minorities.\nOne such example was in November 1988, when members of East Side White Pride beat 28-year-old graduate student Mulugeta Seraw to death with a baseball bat.\u00a0\nNow, Ward says, it feels like it\u2019s happening all over again. \u00a0\nHe says whenever people talk to him about Portland, they always ask about \u201cPortlandia.\u201d\n\u201cThey want to know if it\u2019s true and is it really that quirky? Is it really that progressive? Is the food amazing? And all of those things are actually true.\u201d\nBut, Ward continued, \u201cthere\u2019s another \u2018Portlandia,\u2019 and the other \u2018Portlandia\u2019 isn\u2019t funny. It is a \u2018Portlandia\u2019 that has a white terror crisis.\u201d \nA series of horrifying hate crimes have occurred over the last year and a half in the Portland area. Earlier this month, a Latino family found both of their cars\u2019 windshields smashed in. In one of the cars was an explosive device. Their neighbor\u2019s car was also vandalized and contained a note that said, \u201c#Trump AT ICE\u2014See you soon\u2014Sorry bout that\u2014Sorry not sorry.\u201d \u00a0\nIn March, an Iranian refugee returned home to find a slew of anti-Muslim death threats written in all caps all over his house. \u201cTerrorist\u201d was written on the kitchen cabinet; \u201cFuck you terrorist\u201d on a wall; \u201cMuslim\u201d and \u201cKill you\u201d in the bedroom; \u201cDie\u201d on a mirror; and \u201cHate\u201d on a door.\nThe day after the presidential election, just east of Portland, three men hit a black woman with a brick and beat her.\u00a0One of the men reportedly said, \u201cWe got a president who finally feels how we feel and we\u2019re going to make America great again by getting rid of n****rs like you.\u201d\nTwo months before, a man on a bike pepper-sprayed a black family and screamed a racial slur at them. In the Portland suburb of Gresham,\u00a0a member of the neo-Nazi prison gang European Kindred ran down a 19-year-old black man with his car, killing him.\u00a0The list goes on.\u00a0\nThere have been other unnerving developments, too: A KKK imperial wizard from Mississippi moved to the area, neo-Nazi fliers and swastikas have proliferated in public spaces, and a then-unknown Nazi-saluting Trump-supporter appeared at a rally earlier this month \u2015 the stabber from Friday. \u00a0\nRandy Blazak, a professor and head of the Oregon Coalition Against Hate Crime, said this resurgence of white supremacist activity is undoubtedly linked to the political climate. White nationalists in Oregon and across the country have cheered Donald Trump\u2019s rise.\nThe hate \u201cwas always there,\u201d Blazak said, \u201cbut now it\u2019s been given new permission.\u201d \nThis latest wave of hate is different for a few reasons, Blazak said. It\u2019s less structured than in the \u201880s and \u201890s, a time when he knew the locations of all the skinhead houses around Portland, where the neo-Nazis lived together and partied and fought. \nIt\u2019s not as cohesive as it was back then, he said. White supremacists are largely radicalized online now, and the hate has a new flavor: It is increasingly directed at Muslims, something that began after 9/11. \n\u201cIt\u2019s become the convenient bigotry,\u201d he said.\nNow he\u2019s nervous about an upcoming event: another alt-right rally on Sunday, where there\u2019s set to be a showdown with sometimes violent anti-fascist protesters. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler has called on the federal government to revoke the protesters\u2019 permit, which provoked the ire of free speech defenders like the American Civil Liberties Union.\nA \u201cMarch Against Sharia\u201d organized by the local chapter of the anti-Muslim hate group Act for America, scheduled for June 10, was canceled after public pressure and relocated to Seattle.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be another long, hot summer,\u201d Blazak said. \nTo prepare, Imam Shabazz says he\u2019s telling Muslims to be extra vigilant and for women not to leave the mosque unescorted. \nStill, he\u2019s also confident that the example set by the heroes on the train last Friday will inspire others to act similarly. \n\u201cTheir lives certainly have not gone in vain, because now they have triggered in other people the same idea,\u201d Shabazz said. \u201cPeople can stand up for what\u2019s right and refuse to give in under extraordinary circumstances.\u201d\nAs the sun set Tuesday night over the Hollywood and 42nd Street station, people from all over Portland stopped by to pay their respects to Ricky John Best, 53, and Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche, 23 \u2015 who\u00a0gave their lives protecting their neighbors\u00a0\u2015\u00a0as well as Micah Fletcher, 21, who survived.\nSmall children drew hearts in chalk on the station\u2019s winding walkway up to the tracks. Adults wrote messages like, \u201cThis will not stop us\u201d and \u201cYour sacrifice will ignite change\u201d and \u201cwear your hijab with pride.\u201d A middle-aged man in a suit pulled up in his car, laid down flowers, stood silently for a minute observing the scene and then just as quietly drove off.\nA man who appeared down on his luck struggled to find the right words, until finally saying what was on everyone\u2019s mind: \u201cMuslims are good people, man.\u201d \nOthers lit candles, and looking up at the sprawling memorial in its totality, almost everyone cried. \nA young African-American man who would only give his first name, Mike, had tears streaming down his face. His girlfriend, Anna, who is white, hugged and consoled him. \n\u201cThey were made of steel,\u201d Mike said of the three heroes.\nCORRECTION:\u00a0An earlier version of this story misstated the city where 19-year-old Larnell Bruce was killed.\u00a0\nAmerica does not do a good job of tracking incidents of hate and bias.
