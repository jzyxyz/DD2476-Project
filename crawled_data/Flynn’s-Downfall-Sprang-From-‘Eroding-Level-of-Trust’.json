{"title": "Flynn\u2019s Downfall Sprang From \u2018Eroding Level of Trust\u2019", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Just days into his new position as President Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn found himself in a meeting that any White House official would dread. Face to face with F.B.I. agents, he was grilled about a phone call he had had with Russia\u2019s ambassador.\nWhat exactly Mr. Flynn said has not been disclosed, but current and former government officials said on Tuesday that investigators had come away believing that he was not entirely forthcoming. Soon after, the acting attorney general decided to notify the White House, setting in motion a chain of events that cost Mr. Flynn his job and thrust Mr. Trump\u2019s fledgling administration into a fresh crisis.\nMr. Flynn\u2019s rise and fall followed familiar patterns in Washington, where ambitious figures secure positions of great authority only to lose them in a blizzard of contradictions, recriminations and scandal. But rarely has an official at such a high level risen and fallen in such a dizzyingly short time, in this case just 24 days after Mr. Flynn arrived in the West Wing to take his corner office.\nGiven his short stay at the top, Mr. Flynn\u2019s case might be quickly forgotten as an isolated episode if it did not raise other questions, particularly about what the president knew and when. Even more broadly, it underscores lingering uncertainty about the relationship between the Trump administration and Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s Russia, a subject of great interest given American intelligence reports of Moscow\u2019s intervention in last year\u2019s elections in the United States.\nAs leaders of both parties said on Tuesday that they expected the Senate to investigate and probably even summon Mr. Flynn to testify, more details emerged about a drama that played out largely in secret inside a White House riven by competing power centers. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, revealed that Mr. Trump had known about concerns that Mr. Flynn lied for more than two weeks before demanding his resignation on Monday night. But Vice President Mike Pence was kept in the dark and did not learn that Mr. Flynn had misled him about his Russia contacts until reading news accounts late last week.\nMr. Spicer described a deliberative process in which a new president took his time deciding what to do with Mr. Flynn, a retired three-star general who played a major role in his campaign. The issue, Mr. Spicer said, was not about legality but credibility.\n\u201cThe evolving and eroding level of trust as a result of this situation and a series of other questionable instances is what led the president to ask for General Flynn\u2019s resignation,\u201d he said.\nBut other aides privately said that Mr. Trump, while annoyed at Mr. Flynn, might not have pushed him out had the situation not attracted such attention from the news media. Instead, according to three people close to Mr. Trump, the president made the decision to cast aside Mr. Flynn in a flash, the catalyst being a news alert of a coming article about the matter.\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s time,\u201d Mr. Trump told one of his advisers.\nUntil around that point, Mr. Flynn seemed to think he was going to keep his job. He told The Daily Caller, a conservative news site, on Monday that he had not violated the law. \u201cIf I did, believe me, the F.B.I. would be down my throat, my clearances would be pulled,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were no lines crossed.\u201d\nBut by that evening, he was writing a resignation letter, admitting no deception, only that he had \u201cinadvertently\u201d passed along \u201cincomplete information.\u201d\nThe issue traced back to a call last December between Mr. Flynn, then on tap to become Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, and Sergey I. Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the United States. President Barack Obama was imposing new sanctions on Russia and expelling 35 diplomats after the election meddling.\nThe day after the sanctions were announced, Mr. Putin said Russia would not retaliate in kind, as has been the custom in the long, tortured history of Russian-American relations, instead waiting for a new administration that he assumed would be friendlier.\nInside the Obama administration, officials were stunned. Mr. Trump publicly welcomed the decision. \u201cGreat move on delay (by V. Putin),\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cI always knew he was very smart!\u201d\nAround the same time, Obama advisers heard separately from the F.B.I. about Mr. Flynn\u2019s conversation with Mr. Kislyak, whose calls were routinely monitored by American intelligence agencies that track Russian diplomats. The Obama advisers grew suspicious that perhaps there had been a secret deal between the incoming team and Moscow, which could violate the rarely enforced, two-century-old Logan Act barring private citizens from negotiating with foreign powers in disputes with the United States.\nThe Obama officials asked the F.B.I. if a quid pro quo had been discussed on the call, and the answer came back no, according to one of the officials, who like others asked not to be named discussing delicate communications. The topic of sanctions came up, they were told, but there was no deal.\nOn Jan. 12, David Ignatius, a columnist for The Washington Post, reported that Mr. Flynn had called Mr. Kislyak, setting off news media interest in what was said. Mr. Spicer, then the spokesman for Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team, went to Mr. Flynn, who he said told him that sanctions had not come up during the call. Briefing reporters the next day, Mr. Spicer repeated the misinformation, saying that the conversation had \u201cnever touched on the sanctions.\u201d\nMr. Flynn told the same thing to Mr. Pence and Reince Priebus, the incoming White House chief of staff, who were scheduled to go on the Sunday talk shows and expected that they would be asked about the matter, according to the two men. On Jan. 15, Mr. Pence went on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on CBS and on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d and repeated that sanctions had not been discussed, while Mr. Priebus said much the same on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on NBC.\nThe topic came up again after Mr. Trump and his team moved into the White House. At his first full briefing on Jan. 23, Mr. Spicer said that Mr. Flynn\u2019s conversation had touched on only four subjects, none of them sanctions. That caught the attention of the F.B.I. and the Justice Department.\nSally Q. Yates, an Obama appointee held over as acting attorney general until Mr. Trump\u2019s choice was confirmed, concluded that the disparity between what was said on the call and what Mr. Flynn had evidently told the vice president and others about it might make the new national security adviser vulnerable to blackmail. When foreign governments hold information that could prove embarrassing, it is considered a potential leverage point.\nSoon after the Jan. 23 briefing, James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, sent agents to interview Mr. Flynn. If he told the agents what he said publicly for more than a week after that interview \u2014 that his conversations with the ambassador had been innocuous and did not involve sanctions \u2014 then he could face legal trouble. If the authorities concluded that he knowingly lied to the F.B.I., it could expose him to a felony charge.\nIt was not clear whether Mr. Flynn had a lawyer for his interview or whether anyone at the White House knew the interview was happening. But they knew afterward because Ms. Yates, with the support of Mr. Comey, reached out to Donald F. McGahn II, the new White House counsel, on Jan. 26 to give him what Mr. Spicer called a \u201cheads up\u201d about the discrepancy.\nMr. Trump was told \u201cimmediately,\u201d Mr. Spicer said, and directed Mr. McGahn to look into the matter. After an \u201cextensive review\u201d that lasted several days, Mr. McGahn concluded that nothing in the conversation had violated federal law, Mr. Spicer said.\nBut the president then set out to determine whether he could still trust Mr. Flynn. Mr. Spicer said Mr. Flynn stuck to his original account, making matters worse.\n\u201cWe got to a point not based on a legal issue, but based on a trust issue, with the level of trust between the president and General Flynn had eroded to the point where he felt he had to make a change,\u201d Mr. Spicer said. \u201cThe president was very concerned that General Flynn had misled the vice president and others.\u201d\nAsked if Mr. Trump had instructed Mr. Flynn to talk about sanctions with Mr. Kislyak, Mr. Spicer said, \u201cNo, absolutely not.\u201d Asked if Mr. Trump knew that the issue had come up before the Justice Department told the White House, Mr. Spicer said, \u201cNo, he was not aware.\u201d\nMr. Spicer emphasized that there was \u201cnothing wrong\u201d with Mr. Flynn\u2019s talking with representatives of other countries to prepare for the new president taking office, and that, in fact, Mr. Trump wanted him to.\nBy that point, Mr. Trump\u2019s relationship with Mr. Flynn had grown more awkward. One person close to the president, who asked to remain anonymous to describe private discussions, said Mr. Trump had been \u201cuncomfortable\u201d with Mr. Flynn for weeks. Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, had expressed concern about Mr. Flynn\u2019s appointment even before the inauguration, according to another person briefed on the discussions.\nMr. Trump\u2019s views were coming around to the same point. \u201cWhat he knew was that Flynn was too much about Flynn, versus Mattis,\u201d the person close to the president said. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was seen as deferential to the chain of command. \u201cHe loves Mattis because Mattis is respectful and self-confident.\u201d\nAnother key figure with growing concerns about Mr. Flynn was Stephen K. Bannon, the president\u2019s chief strategist whom Mr. Flynn perceived as a rival for control over national security. Mr. Trump began asking Mr. Mattis about two weeks ago for suggestions of possible replacements for Mr. Flynn. The defense secretary recommended retired Vice Adm. Robert S. Harward. Mr. Bannon reached out to Mr. Harward last week, two senior officials said.\nThe situation escalated late Thursday when word reached the White House that The Washington Post was reporting that the transcript of Mr. Flynn\u2019s call showed that he had discussed sanctions, contrary to his assurances to Mr. Pence and others.\nWhite House officials confronted Mr. Flynn, who only then said that it was possible they had come up, but that he did not remember. \u201cHis story remained the same until that night,\u201d Mr. Spicer said. \u201cThat\u2019s when his response changed.\u201d\nThat was also when Mr. Pence first learned that the Justice Department had proof that Mr. Flynn had not told the truth and had warned the White House two weeks earlier, according to Marc Lotter, his spokesman. \u201cHe did an inquiry based on those media accounts,\u201d Mr. Lotter added, without elaborating.\nAnother person who speaks frequently with him said Mr. Pence went \u201cballistic,\u201d or at least what qualifies as ballistic for the coolheaded vice president.\nMr. Pence, Mr. Priebus and Mr. Bannon urged Mr. Trump to fire the national security adviser, according to officials, but the president could not bring himself to do it, in part for fear of losing face. When a reporter on Air Force One heading to Florida on Friday asked him about The Post\u2019s report, Mr. Trump said he had not read it. \u201cI don\u2019t know about that,\u201d he said. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen it.\u201d\nAs late as Monday, he was sticking by Mr. Flynn. He sent his counselor, Kellyanne Conway, to tell a television interviewer that he had \u201cfull confidence\u201d in Mr. Flynn. And Mr. Flynn phoned a reporter for The Daily Caller on Monday to say the president had \u201cexpressed confidence\u201d in him and urged him to \u201cgo out and talk more.\u201d\nIn that interview, posted on Tuesday, Mr. Flynn said he had discussed the Russian diplomats\u2019 expulsion with Mr. Kislyak. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t about sanctions,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was about the 35 guys who were thrown out.\u201d Mr. Flynn added: \u201cIt was basically, \u2018Look, I know this happened. We\u2019ll review everything.\u2019 I never said anything such as, \u2018We\u2019re going to review sanctions,\u2019 or anything like that.\u201d\nEither way, it was too late. When the matter came to overshadow the president\u2019s glitch-free meeting with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada and word arrived of another Post article on Ms. Yates\u2019s warning to the White House, Mr. Trump ordered an end to the situation. \u201cHe made a determination late in the day,\u201d Mr. Spicer said, \u201cand he executed on it.\u201d", "date": "Feb. 14, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/us/politics/fbi-interviewed-mike-flynn.html", "tags": "trust \u2018 downfall level sprang \u201d trump white house eroding flynn spicer"}
