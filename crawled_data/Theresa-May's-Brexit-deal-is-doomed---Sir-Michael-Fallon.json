{"title": "Theresa May's Brexit deal is doomed - Sir Michael Fallon", "content": "Theresa May's Brexit deal is \"doomed\" and must be renegotiated, ex-defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon has said.\nSir Michael launched a scathing attack on the proposed EU agreement, saying it was the \"worst of all worlds\" and the PM's future was \"up to colleagues\".\nThe prime minister is visiting Wales and Northern Ireland to argue her deal will bring certainty to business.\nDUP leader Arlene Foster told BBC News the trip was a \"waste of time\" as Parliament would not support her deal. \nMrs Foster, whose party has a parliamentary pact with the Conservatives to support the government, said Mrs May had \"given up\" on trying to secure a better deal for Northern Ireland. \nWhile people were \"fed up\" with the Brexit process dragging on, that was not a good enough reason \"to accept what's on the table\", she told the BBC's political editor, Laura Kuenssberg. \nParliament will vote on whether to accept or reject the terms of the UK's withdrawal and future relations negotiated by Mrs May on 11 December.\nSir Michael's decision to come out against the deal is a blow to the prime minister, who is struggling to muster support in Parliament for it. \nLabour, the Lib Dems, the SNP and the Democratic Unionists have said they will vote against the deal while many Tories have said publicly they are opposed. \nOpponents of the deal say it will keep the UK too closely tied to EU rules and make it harder to strike future trade deals with other countries and minimise their value. \nUS President Donald Trump has suggested the withdrawal agreement \"sounds like a great deal for the EU\" and might hamper a future trade deal with the UK but Mrs May said this was not the case. \nIn other developments:\nSir Michael Fallon, who served as defence secretary under David Cameron and Theresa May before having to resign a year ago, told MPs on Monday the agreement was a \"huge gamble\" as it would see the UK give up its power to influence EU rules and regulations in return for vague assurances over future trade arrangements. \nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today that \"this is not a good deal and we need a better deal\", saying that Mr Trump's criticism of its repercussions for transatlantic relations \"could not simply be brushed off\". \n\"My fear is that this deal gives us the worst of all worlds,\" he said. \"No guarantee of smooth trade in the future and no ability to reduce the tariffs that we need to conclude trade deals with the rest of the world.\n\"So, unless the House of Commons can be persuaded somehow that those are possible then I think, yes, the deal is doomed.\"\nAsked if Mrs May was also doomed, he replied \"that's up to my colleagues\", while stressing that a change of leader would not necessarily address the difficulties the UK now found itself in. \nWhen it was put to him that did not sound like an endorsement of Mrs May, he replied \"take it any way you want\".\nThe prominent Brexiteer Bernard Jenkin said there was a lot of \"personal sympathy\" for Mrs May but her authority when it came to the Brexit agreement was \"collapsing\". \nSir Michael said the 29 March 2019 date for Brexit, which is enshrined in UK law, may have to be pushed back to give negotiators the time to make major improvements to the agreement.\nAll 28 EU states would need to agree to extend the Article 50 process of negotiations to allow this to happen, something Theresa May has repeatedly ruled out. \nCabinet Office David Lidington said he did not think doing this \"would get us anywhere\" as the EU had made clear this was the only deal on the table.\nHe told Today there was no \"Plan B\" and the agreement was a \"decent compromise\" which would provide a springboard to the next stage of negotiations on the two sides' future relationship.\nThe prime minister is continuing to making the case for the agreement, which she says delivers on the 2016 referendum vote in key areas and is in the national interest. \nResponding to Mr Trump's comments, Downing Street has insisted the UK will be able to pursue an independent trade policy under the terms of the political declaration on future relations. \nDuring a visit to an agricultural show in Builth Wells, Powys, Mrs May said: \"As regards the United States, we have already been talking to them about the sort of agreement that we could have in the future.\n\"We have a working group set up and that is working very well, has met several times and is continuing to work with the US on this.\"\nUnder the proposed agreement, the UK would not be able to complete any trade deal with a country outside the EU until the end of the proposed transition period - currently scheduled to last until 31 December 2020.\nIn reality, any bilateral agreement between the UK and the US is likely to take years to negotiate given its complexity, differing standards in areas such as agriculture, and the fact it would require ratification by the US Congress.", "date": "27 November 2018", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46356353", "tags": "brexit fallon may agreement uk eu theresa doomed mrs future trade michael sir deal"}
