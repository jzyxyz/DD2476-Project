{"title": "Trump Accuses Democrats Of 'Executing Babies After Birth'", "content": "President Donald Trump lashed out at Democrats Monday night after the Senate blocked a Republican\u00a0anti-abortion bill.\n\u201cSenate Democrats just voted against legislation to prevent the killing of newborn infant children,\u201d Trump tweeted on Monday night. \u201cThe Democrat position on abortion is now so extreme that they don\u2019t mind executing babies AFTER birth.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIf there is one thing we should all agree on, it\u2019s protecting the lives of innocent babies,\u201d he wrote, adding that the blocked measure will be remembered as one of \u201cthe most shocking votes\u201d in congressional history.\u00a0\nThe bill, introduced by Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), aimed to threaten prison time for doctors who do not provide necessary medical care to an infant born alive during an attempted late-term abortion.\u00a0The measure, which needed at least 60 votes to pass, failed with a vote of 53-44.\u00a0\nThe measure seemed unrealistic from the start because medical professionals report that it\u2019s extremely unusual for children to be born during late-term abortions.\u00a0Opponents of the bill said that it was unnecessary because murder, whether of a newborn or an adult, is already illegal and that the measure was intended to discourage doctors from performing late-term abortions.\u00a0\nThe only three Democrats to vote for the measure were Sens.\u00a0Joe Manchin (W.Va.), Doug Jones (Ala.) and\u00a0Bob Casey\u00a0(Pa.).\u00a0\nSasse, who likened the measure to an \u201cinfanticide ban,\u201d proposed the bill as a response to a recent controversy over late-term abortion in Virginia.\u00a0\nLate-term abortion is rare to begin with: Only 1.3 percent of abortions in 2015 were done at 21 weeks or later, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Over 90 percent of abortions take place at or before 13 weeks.\u00a0\nLeana Wen, a physician and the president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said Monday that she was \u201cdisgusted\u201d by Trump\u2019s remarks.\n\u201cAs a mother to a one-year old, I am disgusted by [Trump\u2019s] lies that aim to stoke fear and division,\u201d she tweeted.\u00a0\n\u201cThe President of the United States is lying to the American people about the Sasse bill,\u201d she continued. \u201cWhat [he] is saying has no basis in medicine \u2015 or reality.\u201d", "date": "\n02/26/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-democrats-blocked-gop-abortion-bill_n_5c754abce4b02efbde1ea3b6", "tags": "measure abortions democrats babies trump \u201d late-term abortion bill accuses birth"}
