{"title": "What Intelligence Agencies Concluded About the Russian Attack on the U.S. Election", "content": "The office of the director of national intelligence on Friday released a long-awaited unclassified version of its report for President Obama on what the intelligence agencies said was a multifaceted attempt to influence the 2016 presidential election. The report included only the agencies\u2019 conclusions, not the actual intelligence or technical information on which they were based. \nHere are some major findings, with comments by The New York Times. The full report is available here.\n\u2022 In unequivocal language, the report pins responsibility for the election attack directly on President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, ruling out the possibility that it was ordered by intelligence officials or simply carried out by Kremlin supporters.\n\u2022 United States officials believe Mr. Putin wants to damage the image of American democracy to make it less attractive to Russians and their neighbors.\n_____\n\u2022 Notably, the report concludes that Russia sought not only to damage Hillary Clinton, whom it thought likely to win, but actually tried to help elect Donald J. Trump.\n\u2022 The C.I.A., F.B.I. and N.S.A. agreed on nearly everything in the report, but here we see that the N.S.A. was less certain than the other agencies that Russia was trying to help Mr. Trump.\n_____\n\u2022 An important insight into Mr. Putin\u2019s thinking: He already blamed the United States for multiple campaigns against Russia, including the release of the Panama Papers, showing offshore accounts hiding the fortunes of some of his closest friends and allies, and the exposure of Russian athletes for doping. For him, this was payback.\n\u2022 There is no evidence suggesting that the United States government had a role in releasing the Panama Papers, and while American officials complained of Russian doping, there is no basis to suggest that they fabricated evidence of it.\n_____\n\u2022 The election attack was personal, the report concludes: Mr. Putin thought Mrs. Clinton had insulted him and encouraged demonstrations against him in Russia.\n_____\n\u2022 A new observation: Mr. Putin has enjoyed close relations with some Western leaders who had personal business ties to Russia. The report suggests he may have seen Mr. Trump in a similar light, though the Trump Organization has no major projects in Russia.\n_____\n\u2022 While the intelligence agencies see the leak of hacked materials to influence the election as \u201cunprecedented,\u201d they view it as part of a familiar Russian information strategy using every form of contemporary media to influence public opinion.\n_____\n\u2022 The report\u2019s most specific finding on hacking tracks with what cybersecurity experts have said: that two different hacking groups attacked Democratic targets, one described here as \u201cRussian intelligence,\u201d the other more specifically as the G.R.U., Russian military intelligence.\n\u2022 Contrary to expectations, the report says nothing about the forensic analysis or American spying on which the conclusions are based.\n_____\n\u2022 Here the report accuses the Russian government of going beyond standard cyberespionage, in which hacking is used to get information, to an attack by releasing the information to influence the election.\n\u2022 As expected, the agencies accuse the G.R.U. of being behind Guccifer 2.0 and DCLeaks.com, two outlets that released hacked emails and documents, and with supplying hacked emails to WikiLeaks, though it does not suggest WikiLeaks editors necessarily knew the source.\n_____\n\u2022 The report cites positive Russian news coverage of Mr. Trump\u2019s victory as confirmation that Mr. Putin\u2019s government took sides in the election.\n\u2022 In the agencies\u2019 view, the Russian government sees Mr. Trump\u2019s victory as one in a series of wins for populist movements championed by Mr. Putin.\n_____\n\u2022 The report suggests that Mr. Putin believes the combination of hacking and leaks is a low-risk, high-impact way to influence other countries \u2014 and that Russia is likely to keep trying the same methods against the United States and other countries.", "date": "Jan. 6, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/06/us/politics/russian-hack-report.html", "tags": "intelligence election report concluded \u2022 russian u.s. _____ agencies russia attack putin"}
