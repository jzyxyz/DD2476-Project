{"title": "Vowing to Squeeze Businesses, Trump Has Tactics Challenged", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Donald Trump isn\u2019t done taunting corporate America.\nAfter last week\u2019s Rust Belt victory lap, where he claimed credit for persuading Carrier to keep perhaps 1,000 factory jobs in Indiana, Mr. Trump took to Twitter Sunday morning and warned of retribution for other companies contemplating moving production abroad.\nBut even as Mr. Trump tries to put the bully in bully pulpit, the question of whether his approach is smart economic policy, improvised showmanship or a bit of both is another story.\nIndeed, his tactics have drawn criticism from both the left and the right, with a range of experts saying his approach may be ineffective at best, and crony-capitalist and caudillo-like at worst.\n\u201cBlackmail is implicit in this approach, and it\u2019s dangerous,\u201d said Tyler Cowen, a conservative free market-oriented economist who teaches at George Mason University. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of political theater, but that\u2019s not even my biggest criticism. Trump is negotiating with individual businesses outside of the rule of law and bureaucratic procedure.\u201d\nOn Friday, Mr. Trump took aim at Rexnord, another manufacturer with a plant in Indianapolis, which disclosed plans in October to move to Mexico. \u201cNo more!\u201d he said on Twitter, helping to push Rexnord\u2019s stock down 8 percent for the week.\nAccording to Mr. Trump, the penalty would be a 35 percent tariff imposed on goods that companies ship back into the United States after they move production abroad. It is doubtful that Mr. Trump would have the legal authority to punish individual companies without congressional action. But he is also promising a broader overhaul of corporate taxes and the elimination of a host of regulations that he sees as stifling American companies, in addition to individual incentive packages like the $7 million one that Carrier received.\nMike Konczal, an economist at the left-leaning Roosevelt Institute, said he also thought Mr. Trump\u2019s approach was doomed to failure, especially if he kept his campaign pledge to reduce taxes on corporations and investors.\n\u201cCutting taxes for shareholders will destroy more factories than whatever he saves by jawboning companies from the bully pulpit,\u201d Mr. Konczal said. And incentives like the ones Carrier received only forestall the inevitable shift by multinational giants to low-cost locales like Mexico and Asia. \u201cThey will just go later after pocketing some money,\u201d Mr. Konczal said.\nMaking deals with big business may prove much harder than Mr. Trump is willing to acknowledge. After all, he held off on using a stick with Carrier, and handed over $7 million worth of carrots, but the company gave Mr. Trump only half of what he wanted, with 1,000 Indiana jobs still leaving for Mexico.\nMoreover, Mr. Trump is pushing back against tectonic economic forces that show no sign of easing. Besides the continuing loss of factory jobs to automation, Carrier is far from unique in shifting blue-collar jobs to places like Mexico, even as it keeps white-collar functions like sales and research and development in Indiana.\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a silver bullet,\u201d said Steven Rattner, a veteran financier and Democrat who led President Obama\u2019s successful effort to rescue the auto industry in 2009. \u201cAnd what\u2019s ironic is that there isn\u2019t a single thing in Donald Trump\u2019s campaign platform that would help people hurt by these trends.\u201d Mr. Rattner is also a contributing opinion writer for The New York Times.\nStill, whether it\u2019s a smart strategy or not, it is clear Mr. Trump is planning more Carrier-like standoffs after he moves into the Oval Office on Jan. 20.\n\u201cThis is no one-off,\u201d he said in an interview with The Times after touring the Carrier factory floor in Indianapolis on Thursday and greeting cheering workers. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019m here as opposed to doing it from my lobby in Manhattan.\u201d\nRather than tax breaks or tariffs on a case-by-case basis, perhaps the best argument for Mr. Trump\u2019s tactics is that they may prompt a rethinking of corporate responsibility among executives, said Justin Wolfers, an economist and New York Times contributor who teaches at the University of Michigan.\n\u201cThe question is, what\u2019s the game?\u201d Mr. Wolfers said. \u201cIf it\u2019s about changing norms, and saying private enrichment at the expense of the broader public good is no longer socially acceptable, that\u2019s important.\u201d\nTo be sure, actually imposing tariffs is much, much more difficult than sending Twitter posts \u2014 or negotiating deals with individual companies like Carrier and its corporate parent, United Technologies, a major defense contractor.\nAlthough the president has wide-ranging powers to impose trade sanctions on countries found to be manipulating their currencies or exporting goods for less than it costs to produce them, Mr. Trump is venturing into uncharted territory with tariffs aimed at individual American companies.\n\u201cI\u2019m not aware that this has been tried before or what authority the Trump administration would be relying on,\u201d said Miriam Sapiro, who served as deputy United States trade representative from 2009 to 2014.\n\u201cThen there is the question of what kind of retaliation these tariffs could cause, harming both American workers and consumers as well as companies,\u201d said Ms. Sapiro, now a partner at Finsbury, a strategic communications firm in Washington.\nThe off-the-cuff nature of Mr. Trump\u2019s outbursts may partly explain why economists have been left aghast by Mr. Trump\u2019s tactics to keep jobs at home.\nBut some experts say the shock is overdone.\n\u201cFrankly, I\u2019m flabbergasted by the opposition on the left,\u201d said Alan Tonelson, an economist formerly with the United States Business and Industry Council, which represents family-owned and privately held domestic manufacturers. \u201cThey\u2019ve been just fine imposing tariffs to help Detroit, the steel industry and organized labor.\u201d\nAs for conservative and libertarian criticism, Mr. Tonelson speculated that might have more to do with corporate support for the Washington think tanks they call home, rather than genuine ideological fervor.\nThe economic soundness of Mr. Trump\u2019s tactics may be in question, but they clearly offer political rewards, especially in the Rust Belt, where the costs of free trade are more readily apparent than the benefits.\n\u201cThe dry statistics on trade aren\u2019t working to counter Trump,\u201d Timothy A. Duy, an economics professor at the University of Oregon, said in a blog post on Sunday. \u201cThe aggregate gains are irrelevant to someone suffering a personal loss. Critics need to find an effective response to Trump. I don\u2019t think we have it yet.\u201d\nWhile the costs of free trade tend to be concentrated, benefits like lower prices for imported goods are spread very broadly, making them less obvious. In an interview on Fox News on Sunday, Newt Gingrich, former speaker of the House and a Republican Trump ally, questioned whether that trade-off made sense.\nIn some cases, he said, Americans should be \u201cprepared to pay a little bit more for imported products\u201d to keep jobs at home.\nIf trade advocates can\u2019t make a better case, or at least come up with better ways to help the inevitable economic losers of globalization cope, then free trade itself may be imperiled, whatever the overall benefits.\n\u201cPeople who advocated for free trade policies, myself included, should have advocated more forcefully for things to help these people, through ideas like retraining or tax credits to simply maintain their incomes,\u201d Mr. Rattner said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do something to help these people, we will end up without free trade, as may well happen with Mr. Trump coming into office.\u201d", "date": "Dec. 4, 2016", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/04/us/politics/trump-takes-twitter-aim-at-companies-looking-to-move-jobs-abroad.html", "tags": "carrier may mr. tactics companies \u201d trump squeeze trade like vowing challenged businesses"}
