{"title": "Trump Defends 'Both Sides' Charlottesville Comments With A New Falsehood", "content": "President Donald Trump on Friday defended comments he made after the deadly \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017, when he infamously said there were \u201cvery fine people on both sides\u201d of the violent white supremacist gathering.\nTrump told reporters outside the White House that he didn\u2019t mean to describe white nationalists, neo-Nazis and other extremists as \u201cvery fine people,\u201d as he did during a news conference back then. Rather, he claims he was talking about the people protesting the removal of the Robert E. Lee statue in Charlottesville \u2015 a glaringly false statement, given that everyone who participated in the \u201cUnite The Right\u201d torch march on Aug. 11 and rally on Aug. 12 was a neo-Nazi or a white supremacist, and they came to commit violence.\n\u201cI was talking about people that went because they felt very strongly about the monument to Robert E. Lee,\u201d Trump said, according to CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins. \u201cPeople there were protesting the taking down of the monument to Robert E. Lee. Everybody knows that.\u201d\nIn reality, \u201cUnite the Right\u201d wasn\u2019t billed as a rally for the Lee statue, which still stands today despite local campaigns to get it taken down over the years. The Lee statue and the controversy surrounding it merely served as a backdrop for two days\u2019 worth of clashes, which ended with one protester dead and dozens of others wounded.\nEvent posters from the time advertised a gathering of \u201cpro-white\u201d groups that had until that point spent much of their time online \u2015 headliners included known neo-Nazis and white supremacists like Christopher Cantwell (known not-so-affectionately as the \u201ccryin\u2019 Nazi\u201d) and Richard Spencer.\nStill, Trump on Friday doubled down, noting his admiration for Confederate General Robert E. Lee. Lee\u2019s own descendent called him an \u201cidol of white supremacy.\u201d\n\u201cWhether you like it or not, he was one of the great generals,\u201d Trump said, according to Washington Post columnist Josh Rogin. Trump then claimed active-duty generals have told him Lee was their \u201cfavorite general.\u201d\u00a0\nThe White House did not respond to a request for details on when, where and which active duty generals allegedly told the president that Lee was their \u201cfavorite general.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s comments come after former Vice President Joe Biden featured footage of the Charlottesville rally in his announcement of his 2020 presidential run, and referenced Trump\u2019s poor response. That said, Biden\u2019s video also drew criticism from Charlottesville activists,\u00a0who said he was using their pain as a \u201cpolitical prop.\u201d\u00a0He reportedly withdrew from initial plans to announce his presidency in Charlottesville,\u00a0opting to release the video\u00a0and attend a fundraiser in Philadelphia.\nJennifer Bendery contributed reporting.\nThis has been updated with information about Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign announcement.", "date": "\n04/26/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-defends-both-sides-charlottesville-comments-with-a-new-falsehood_n_5cc30c9de4b08846403d585d", "tags": "people falsehood lee \u201d trump defends white rally robert comments sides charlottesville new"}
