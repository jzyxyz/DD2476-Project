{"title": "Brazil candidate Fernando Haddad: The man in Lula's mantle", "content": "To say Fernando Haddad has had a busy few months is an understatement. Mr Haddad replaced former President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva as the presidential candidate for the Workers' Party less than a month before the first round of the election. \nAfter he made it into the run-off which took place 28 October, his life got even busier as he tried - and ultimately failed - to win over voters to beat his right-wing rival Jair Bolsonaro.\nWhen Fernando Haddad stood in for Lula on 11 September after electoral authorities banned the former leader from running for president because of his conviction for corruption and money laundering, he was relatively unknown.\nThe 55-year-old had served as mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo and also as education minister but had little name recognition outside S\u00e3o Paulo.\nLula's wholehearted endorsement was therefore key for Mr Haddad. \nAs Lula is serving a 12-year prison sentence, that endorsement came in the form of a letter written from his cell: \"From now on, Haddad will be Lula for millions of Brazilians,\" it read.\nA lot of voters who had backed Lula switched allegiances from Lula to Mr Haddad - he rose from 4% to 23% in the pre-election opinion polls - but he was not able to reach the almost 40% who had said they intended to vote for Lula.\nThere is little doubt that Lula is a political godfather to Mr Haddad but despite the close links between the two men, Mr Haddad sought to project a slightly different image to that of the 72-year-old former president.\nAbove all, Mr Haddad tried to portray himself as more of a moderate than the firebrand, working-class Lula. Part of Mr Haddad's campaign strategy was to try to woo the wider electorate with promises of gradual reforms. \nThese promises came after turbulent years in which Brazil was rocked by an increase in violent crime and a huge political bribery scandal that has tainted the entire political class, ensnaring not only Lula but several other senior figures in the Workers' Party. \nIn politically polarised Brazil, Lula's mantle proved as much a liability as a boost to Mr Haddad, and it was difficult for him to find the right balance.", "date": "25 October 2018", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-45746012", "tags": "candidate fernando lula mantle former man political party tried brazil workers haddad"}
