{"title": "The Spectacular Catastrophe Of Charlottesville Rally Organizer's Lawsuit For A Unite The Right Sequel", "content": "CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. \u2015 \u201cI want to know what\u2019s going on. What is the point of this?\u201d\nThese are the exasperated words of U.S. District Judge Norman K. Moon,\u00a0directed at a crack team of lawyers for white supremacist rally organizer Jason Kessler, in federal court on Tuesday. Minutes later, Kessler\u2019s lawyers abruptly withdrew their case against the city \u2014 filed after he was denied a permit for a 36-hour sequel to last year\u2019s Unite the Right rally in Market Street Park (formerly Emancipation Park) on Aug. 11 and 12. One person was killed, and dozens of others were injured in violence surrounding that rally.\nBringing a federal judge to his breaking point today was no easy task; Kessler\u2019s team really had to work for it.\nHe and one of his lawyers, James Kolenich, were 45 minutes late to their hearing. Kolenich told reporters matter-of-factly, \u201cI am anti-Semitic,\u201d called Pope Francis a \u201cclown\u201d and said he represents the National Socialist Movement (when he\u2019s not totally blowing it as Kessler\u2019s attorney). And yet none of these alone begin to capture how off the rails the hearing was from beginning to end.\nIt all started with white supremacist defense attorney Elmer Woodard \u2015 scraggly white mutton chops, bowtie, pinstripe suit and all \u2015 who seemed surprised that his co-counsel and Kessler weren\u2019t there.\nKolenich, he said, was on a flight from Cincinnati, trying his best to show up.\n\u201cHe\u2019s late. He\u2019s now in a cab, on the way here,\u201d Woodard said to Moon. Woodard didn\u2019t seem to have an explanation for Kessler\u2019s absence.\n\u201cThe ball is in your court,\u201d Moon replied.\nWoodard warbled his way through opening remarks, declaring that the denial of Kessler\u2019s permit was unconstitutional. Among other wacky statements, Woodard said he prepared a mathematical analysis for the court, arguing that the city couldn\u2019t deny Kessler on the basis of Market Street Park\u2019s capacity.\n\u201cWe did the math,\u201d\u00a0Woodard said,\u00a0and given the \u201csquare footage of the park versus the square footage of an average person ... 10,000 people could fit.\u201d\u00a0\nHe added, \u201cWe\u2019re only asking for a few hundred people for a few hours.\u201d\nAt several points, Moon held his forehead in his hand. When Woodard offered that maybe Kessler could have, oh, let\u2019s say two hours to rally with a few hundred people on Aug. 12, Moon started losing his cool.\u00a0He wasn\u2019t here to decide what time the rally was.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a dog in this fight. I\u2019m not going to be there. What is he [Kessler] asking for?\u201d\u00a0Moon asked.\nLater, the city\u2019s attorney,\u00a0John Longstreth, spoke. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know where to start,\u201d he said, as a few giggles rang out from the spectators.\nThe city\u2019s counterclaim was relatively simple. \u201cHe is going on the internet, trolling around in the darkest corners of it,\u201d Longstreth said of Kessler. \u201cIf he were granted a permit, he would invite everyone who wanted to come ... It\u2019s a redo of one of the darkest days in Charlottesville\u2019s history.\u201d\nIn the middle of Longstreth\u2019s statement,\u00a0Kolenich finally showed up, interrupting only to admit that he didn\u2019t have any of the fact-finding paperwork that Moon had asked for.\n\u201cWhat is the point of this?\u201d Moon said. \u201cMr. Kessler isn\u2019t even here.\u201d\nKolenich lamented that his flight was canceled late Monday night, his child fell ill and Kessler was nowhere to be found.\n\u201cI can\u2019t control American Airlines,\u201d Kolenich said. \u201cI\u2019ll fly in the day before next time.\u201d\n\u201cYour client\u2019s not here, you were not here, and I want to know what\u2019s going on,\u201d Moon said.\nJust as Kolenich and Woodard were about to admit defeat, Kessler showed up, in a white shirt and blue jeans, smirking as he entered the courtroom.\u00a0His team recessed to talk, and when they returned, Kolenich abruptly withdrew his request for an injunction. He told reporters afterward that Kessler wouldn\u2019t be pursuing the permit anymore for \u201cvarious tactical reasons.\u201d\nReporters swarmed Kolenich after the hearing, asking him to state repeatedly that Kessler wouldn\u2019t be holding a rally in Charlottesville on Aug. 11 or 12. Apparently, he would not. But when a reporter asked Kolenich if he was anti-Semitic, given the people he represents, he went off.\n\u201cI am an anti-Semite because I\u2019m a Roman Catholic,\u201d he said. \u201cNot a Nazi.\u201d\nHe said he has been trying to clean up Kessler\u2019s image by ordering him to denounce Nazis publicly on Twitter. Kolenich also said he represents the National Socialist Movement in court. Then he reiterated that he\u2019s Roman Catholic, \u201ca real Roman Catholic, unlike that clown who calls himself the pope.\u201d\nReporters and gawkers were shaking their heads in disbelief while outside there was a small celebration happening. Prominent members of the black community in the city said they\u2019re excited that Kessler withdrew but aren\u2019t getting their hopes up that Aug. 11 and 12 will be a Nazi-free weekend in Charlottesville.\n\u201cThis whole thing was a joke,\u201d said Tanesha Hudson,\u00a0a Charlottesville native. \u201cYou think I could have walked into court 45 minutes late in jeans? I would have been held in contempt.\u201d\nShe and City Councilman Wes Bellamy, who was at the Unite the Right rally last year and in court today, said that the lawsuit was a smokescreen tactic and that white supremacy hasn\u2019t gone away just because Kessler failed to get a piece of paper.\n\u201cThey\u2019re coming back,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cEven if it\u2019s a pop-up tiki-torch-lighting event, they\u2019re coming,\u201d she said.\nIt is unclear whether Kessler will in town on Aug. 12 this year. He said on Twitter after the hearing that he\u2019s focusing on a rally that he did get a permit for on that date in Washington, D.C.", "date": "\n07/24/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jason-kessler-charlottesville-rally-lawsuit_n_5b578171e4b0de86f4915e07", "tags": "lawsuit spectacular unite court city \u201d rally catastrophe organizer charlottesville sequel right kessler kolenich moon woodard"}
