{"title": "People Are Pissed That Sam Took Credit For Gilly\u2019s Discovery On \u2018Game Of Thrones\u2019", "content": "It seems that even the nicest guy in Westeros can be a tool.\nBy the Season 7 finale on \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d\u00a0it was revealed that Sam (John Bradley) really had been listening to Gilly (Hannah Murray) when she dropped part of the most crucial plot twist\u00a0of the season.\nBut, to the dismay of many women viewers, Sam also took credit for Gilly\u2019s find.\nNot only is it a scenario many women are familiar with, but it prompted some of them to express their straight-up disdain on Twitter.\nIn Season 7\u2032s Episode 5, Gilly and Sam are sitting together reading through some historical records in Oldtown when Gilly asks what the word \u201cannulment\u201d means. After Sam provides the definition, Gilly casually drops the bombshell that Prince Rhaegar Targaryen had annulled his marriage to Elia Martell and instead married someone else\u00a0\u2015 strongly suspected to be Lyanna Stark, Jon\u2019s mother \u2015\u00a0in a secret ceremony in Dorne.\nThe information implied that Jon may not a bastard, but the rightful heir to the Iron Throne \u2015 which is\u00a0huge\u00a0news.\nSam, however, is preoccupied with finding a way to prevent impending doom, and completely steamrolls Gilly and her juicy revelation.\nFlash-forward to the Season 7 finale, when Bran (Isaac Hempstead Wright) divulges to Sam that\u00a0\u2015 thanks to his all-knowing abilities as the Three-Eyed Raven \u2015\u00a0he\u2019s discovered Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark to be Jon\u2019s parents.\u00a0That\u2019s when Sam tells Bran about Rhaegar\u2019s annulment, a bit of information\u00a0he\u00a0read in the diary of the High Septon Maynard. He gives zero credit to Gilly, his partner who has been supporting him throughout the show.\u00a0\nSo, in an attempt to do what Sam should have done in the first place, we at HuffPost are here to say: Good job, Gilly!", "date": "\n08/28/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/upset-sam-credit-gilly-discovery-jon-snow-parents-annulment-game-of-thrones_n_59a443b7e4b0821444c4db58", "tags": "people credit \u2018 game finale many took sam season \u201d \u2015 jon gilly thrones rhaegar pissed discovery"}
