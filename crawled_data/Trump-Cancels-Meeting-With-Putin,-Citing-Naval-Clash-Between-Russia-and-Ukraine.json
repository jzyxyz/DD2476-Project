{"title": "Trump Cancels Meeting With Putin, Citing Naval Clash Between Russia and Ukraine", "content": "BUENOS AIRES \u2014 President Trump on Thursday abruptly canceled his planned meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, citing the unresolved naval standoff between Russia and Ukraine and upending his hopes of further cementing the relationship between the two leaders.\nThe president\u2019s decision, announced on Twitter barely an hour after he told reporters he still expected to go through with the meeting, came shortly after new revelations that Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer had negotiated to build a tower in Moscow much later during the 2016 presidential election than previously acknowledged.\nThe last-minute cancellation underscored just how fraught the Russian-American relationship has grown despite the president\u2019s concerted efforts to make friends, as the Kremlin increasingly asserts itself overseas while Washington is absorbed by the investigation into ties between Mr. Trump\u2019s circle and Moscow.\nWhen Mr. Trump met with Mr. Putin in Helsinki last summer, it came just days after the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, had indicted 12 Russian intelligence officers in the hacking of Democratic emails during the 2016 campaign. Undaunted, Mr. Trump went ahead with that meeting and, with Mr. Putin at his side, challenged the conclusions of American intelligence agencies about Russian election interference.\nThe Buenos Aires session, which had been scheduled for Saturday on the sidelines of the Group of 20 economic summit meeting, was only the second to be canceled between top American and Russian or Soviet leaders since an American U-2 spy plane piloted by Francis Gary Powers was shot down over Russian territory in 1960. The other time came in 2013 when President Barack Obama called off a trip to Moscow to protest Mr. Putin\u2019s decision to shelter Edward J. Snowden, the National Security Agency leaker.\nMr. Trump has adamantly denied any collusion with Russia during the campaign and dismissed questions about business ventures or economic interests in Russia. But Michael D. Cohen, his former personal lawyer and fixer, admitted in court on Thursday that he had engaged in negotiations for a Moscow tower well into the campaign and had personally briefed Mr. Trump and members of his family.\nThe president said that Mr. Cohen was \u201cweak\u201d and lying in order to reduce his sentence for various criminal charges, adding that while a Moscow tower had been considered, he had opted against it because he was running for president. But Mr. Trump insisted that there would have been nothing wrong with pursuing such a project as a candidate if he had.\nEven as he denounced his former lawyer on Thursday morning, Mr. Trump told reporters that he still planned to go ahead with his meeting with Mr. Putin.\n\u201cI probably will be meeting with President Putin,\u201d he told reporters on the South Lawn of the White House just after 10:30 a.m. as he left on the trip to Buenos Aires. \u201cI think it\u2019s a very good time to have the meeting.\u201d He added that he would be getting a report on Air Force One about the Russia-Ukraine confrontation \u201cand that will determine what I\u2019m going to be doing.\u201d\nAt 11:34 a.m., he reversed himself, announcing on Twitter that he would scrap the meeting after all, attributing the move to the Ukraine conflict. Russian forces seized three small Ukrainian naval vessels and more than 20 sailors on Sunday, including at least three wounded in a shooting by the Russian side.\n\u201cBased on the fact that the ships and sailors have not been returned to Ukraine from Russia, I have decided it would be best for all parties concerned to cancel my previously scheduled meeting in Argentina with President Vladimir Putin,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote.\n\u201cI look forward to a meaningful Summit again as soon as this situation is resolved!\u201d he added.\nSarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, told reporters on Air Force One that Mr. Trump had scrubbed the meeting after reviewing the report on Russia\u2019s actions against Ukraine. Mr. Trump conferred with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, who were on the plane, and by telephone with John R. Bolton, his national security adviser, who was in Brazil.\nBut a meeting with Mr. Putin also could have raised questions about Mr. Trump\u2019s ties to Russia after Mr. Cohen\u2019s revelations, producing an politically uncomfortable moment.\nRussia analysts noted that nothing had changed in the Russian-Ukrainian standoff in days and that Mr. Trump had not seen it necessary to scratch the meeting before.\n\u201cThis is a no-brainer,\u201d said Michael Carpenter, senior director of the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement and a former Pentagon official under Mr. Obama.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about the political optics in light of the Trump Tower Moscow news and the fact that Trump simply can\u2019t bring himself to ever confront Putin in public,\u201d Mr. Carpenter said. \u201cThis would have been a P.R. disaster of epic proportions if he had agreed to meet and not confronted Putin.\u201d\nOnce again, however, Mr. Trump\u2019s ad hoc decision-making caught a foreign government unawares. Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, told Russian reporters that they had seen Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter posting but had no other word from the American government.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have official information,\u201d he said, according to the Tass news agency. He added, \u201cIf this is so,\u201d then Mr. Putin \u201cwill have a few additional hours in the schedule for useful meetings on the sidelines of the summit.\u201d\nOther sub-dramas were percolating in Buenos Aires as Mr. Trump flew on Thursday. The president downgraded scheduled meetings with two allies, Presidents Moon Jae-in of South Korea and Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, without explanation. Instead of full-fledged sessions, the president will have \u201cpull-asides\u201d with both, according to the White House, meaning casual chats on the sideline of the main sessions.\nAt the same time, speculation focused on whether Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada would attend the ceremonial signing on Friday of the revised version of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Mr. Trump has rebranded the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Mr. Trudeau\u2019s schedule did not include the ceremony, but a Canadian official late Thursday confirmed that he would attend.\nAnd then there was Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who also has a tense relationship with Mr. Trump and was scheduled to meet with him on Friday. Her government plane was forced to land en route to Buenos Aires by technical difficulties and she was reported to be turning to a commercial flight on Friday, an embarrassment for the leader of a major power.\nAssuming they do meet, Mr. Trump and Ms. Merkel will presumably discuss the Ukraine crisis. While Mr. Trump had said earlier in the week that he was not happy about Russia\u2019s latest aggression, he had left any stronger denunciation to his United Nations ambassador. Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle had called on Mr. Trump to take a tougher stance and even cancel the meeting with Mr. Putin.\nMr. Trump had been seeking another meeting with Mr. Putin for months, first suggesting the Russian leader visit the White House and later trying to arrange to sit down together in Paris earlier this month, but neither idea went ahead. Instead, the two leaders settled on Buenos Aires for their next meeting.\nThe session was already freighted by multiple tension points between the two countries in addition to the lingering issues of the election meddling and the clash with Ukraine.\nMr. Trump recently declared that he would withdraw the United States from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty signed by Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev in 1987, citing Russian violations, an issue that was sure to come up. Syria and Iran were other flash points expected to be discussed.\nSome veteran diplomats said the scrubbed meeting was a missed opportunity to pressure Mr. Putin into easing the conflict with Ukraine and to find a possible compromise that would enable them to salvage the I.N.F. Treaty.\n\u201cI would have preferred that he had stuck with the meeting and delivered a strong rebuke to Putin for Sunday\u2019s aggression, with a threat of punitive steps if Russia doesn\u2019t quickly release the ships and the crews,\u201d said Alexander Vershbow, who served as ambassador to Russia under President George W. Bush.\n\u201cBut given that Trump may be incapable of doing that, and might have endorsed Putin\u2019s \u2018vigorous denials\u2019 that Russia was responsible,\u201d he added, \u201ccancellation may have been the best course.\u201d\nMolly McKew, a consultant who has advised the leaders of governments threatened by Moscow, said Mr. Trump clearly wanted to avoid having to confront Mr. Putin directly over Ukraine. \u201cSince he doesn\u2019t have the constitution to say it to Putin\u2019s face, he sent it as a tweet,\u201d she said. \u201cIn many respects \u2014 and to avoid Helsinki 2.0 \u2014 this is probably the best outcome. He can say he did it and not end up looking the fool.\u201d", "date": "Nov. 29, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/us/politics/trump-putin-meeting-g20.html", "tags": "ukraine citing russian clash meeting trump cancels \u201d russia naval putin"}
