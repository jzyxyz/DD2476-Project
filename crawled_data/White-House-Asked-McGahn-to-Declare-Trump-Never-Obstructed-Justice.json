{"title": "White House Asked McGahn to Declare Trump Never Obstructed Justice", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 White House officials asked at least twice in the past month for the key witness against President Trump in the Mueller report, Donald F. McGahn II, to say publicly that he never believed the president obstructed justice, according to two people briefed on the requests.\nMr. Trump asked White House officials to make the request to Mr. McGahn, who was the president\u2019s first White House counsel, one of the people said. Mr. McGahn declined. His reluctance angered the president, who believed that Mr. McGahn showed disloyalty by telling investigators for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, about Mr. Trump\u2019s attempts to maintain control over the Russia investigation.\nThe White House made one of the requests to Mr. McGahn\u2019s lawyer, William A. Burck, before the Mueller report was released publicly but after the Justice Department gave a copy to Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers in the preceding days. Reading the report, the president\u2019s lawyers saw that Mr. Mueller left out that Mr. McGahn had told investigators that he believed the president never obstructed justice. Mr. Burck had told them months earlier about his client\u2019s belief on the matter and that he had shared it with investigators.\nMr. McGahn initially entertained the White House request. \u201cWe did not perceive it as any kind of threat or something sinister,\u201d Mr. Burck said in a statement. \u201cIt was a request, professionally and cordially made.\u201d A White House spokeswoman did not respond to a message seeking comment.\nBut after the report was released, detailing the range of actions Mr. Trump took to try to impede the inquiry, Mr. McGahn decided to pass on putting out a statement supportive of the president. The report also revealed that Mr. Trump told aides he believed Mr. McGahn had leaked to the news media to make himself look good.\nThe episodes show the lengths the White House has gone around the release of the Mueller report to push back on the notion that Mr. Trump obstructed justice. House Democrats have used the report to open investigations into whether Mr. Trump abused his position to insulate himself from the Russia inquiry.\nThe revelations came as the Democrats on Friday increased their pressure on the White House on other fronts. The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Richard E. Neal, subpoenaed the Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service for six years of Mr. Trump\u2019s personal and business tax returns. Democrats are also pursuing testimony from Mr. Mueller but have not agreed on a date, Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, told reporters.\nIn the days after the report was released, White House officials asked Mr. McGahn again to put out a statement as Mr. Trump fumed about his disclosures but Mr. McGahn rebuffed the second request as well.\nWhite House officials believed that Mr. McGahn publicly asserting his belief would calm the president and help the administration push back on the episodes that Mr. Mueller detailed in the obstruction section of the report, said one of the people. Both spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations involving the White House.\nAround the time Mr. McGahn declined the second request, the president\u2019s lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani began publicly attacking his credibility, saying that Mr. McGahn had a bad memory. \u201cIt can\u2019t be taken at face value,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said of Mr. McGahn\u2019s account one day after the Mueller report was released. \u201cIt could be the product of an inaccurate recollection or could be the product of something else.\u201d\nThe White House learned in August that Mr. McGahn had told Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigators that he believed the president had not obstructed justice, according to one of the people. After a New York Times article revealed that Mr. McGahn had spoken to investigators for at least 30 hours, Mr. Burck tried to reassure the White House by explaining that his client told Mr. Mueller that he never believed Mr. Trump had committed an obstruction offense.\nMr. McGahn\u2019s cooperation with Mr. Mueller played a crucial role in allowing the special counsel\u2019s investigators to paint a picture in their report of a president determined to use his power atop the executive branch to protect himself from the Russia investigation.\nThe president\u2019s lawyers are particularly concerned about two episodes that Mr. McGahn detailed to prosecutors. In one, Mr. Trump asked him to fire the special counsel but backed off after Mr. McGahn refused. After that episode was revealed, the president asked Mr. McGahn to create a White House document falsely rebutting his account. Mr. McGahn declined to go along but told Mr. Mueller about the encounters.\nIt makes no difference legally whether Mr. McGahn believes Mr. Trump obstructed justice. That is a determination made by prosecutors, not witnesses. But politically, such a statement could have been a powerful argument for Mr. Trump, who faces scrutiny from House Democrats about whether he obstructed justice and abused his power.\nMr. Mueller declined to make a determination about whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice, saying that because a sitting president cannot be indicted, it was unfair to accuse him of committing a crime. Attorney General William P. Barr stepped in and decided with his deputy, Rod J. Rosenstein, to clear Mr. Trump of wrongdoing.\nBut because Mr. Mueller made no determination \u2014 and wrote a damning report that showed repeated efforts by Mr. Trump to interfere with his inquiry \u2014 questions about whether the president obstructed justice have lingered as Democrats have sought to gain momentum in their investigation of Mr. Trump.\nThe Democrat-led House Judiciary Committee has subpoenaed Mr. McGahn to testify. But White House advisers have indicated they will try to block him from appearing before lawmakers, and Mr. Trump has said that there is no reason for Mr. McGahn to speak with congressional investigators because he had cooperated so extensively with Mr. Mueller\u2019s team.\n\u201cI\u2019ve had him testifying already for 30 hours and it\u2019s really \u2014 so I don\u2019t think I can let him and then tell everybody else you can\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Trump said last week in an interview with Fox News. \u201cEspecially him, because he was a counsel, so they\u2019ve testified for many hours, all of them, many, many, many people. I can\u2019t say, \u2018Well, one can and the others can\u2019t.\u2019 I would say it\u2019s done.\u201d\nMr. McGahn left the White House last year but is still entangled with the president on matters related to the Mueller investigation. The White House instructed Mr. McGahn on Tuesday to not turn over documents he had to the House in response to a subpoena. Mr. McGahn followed the White House\u2019s advice and is now waiting to see whether Democrats will hold him in contempt.", "date": "May 10, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/10/us/politics/mcgahn-trump-obstruction.html", "tags": "obstructed report declare mcgahn never white house trump justice asked mueller"}
