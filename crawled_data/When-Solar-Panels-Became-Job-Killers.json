{"title": "When Solar Panels Became Job Killers", "content": "WUHAN, China \u2014 Russell Abney raised two children on solar power. The 49-year-old Georgia Tech graduate worked for the last decade in Perrysburg, Ohio, a suburb of Toledo, pulling a good salary as an equipment engineer for the largest American solar-panel maker.\nOn the other side of the world, Gao Song boasted his own solar success story. A former organic fruit retailer who lives in the dusty Chinese city of Wuhan, he installed solar panels on his roof four years ago and found it so lucrative that he went into business installing them for others. By last summer, he and a team of 50 employees were installing solar-panel systems on nearly 100 roofs a month.\nThen China shook the global solar business \u2014 and transformed both their lives.\n\u201cA small vibration back in China,\u201d said Frank Haugwitz, a longtime solar industry consultant in Beijing, \u201ccan cause an avalanche in prices around the world.\u201d\nLate last summer, Chinese officials began publicly toying with slashing the subsidies they offer domestic solar-panel buyers. Mr. Gao\u2019s business dried up, and he laid off half his workers. \u201cI have been working hard and was just off to a good start,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I have to start over.\u201d\nChina\u2019s solar-panel makers cut their prices by more than a quarter to compensate, sending global prices plummeting. Western companies found themselves unable to compete, and cut jobs from Germany to Michigan to Texas and points beyond.\nThose points included Perrysburg \u2014 where Mr. Abney and about 450 other employees suddenly found themselves out of work. \u201cWithin just a few months, it all came crashing down,\u201d Mr. Abney said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a death in the family. People feel awkward talking about it.\u201d\nPresident Trump, who pressed President Xi Jinping of China on trade and other issues this week when they met at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Fla., has vowed to end what he calls China\u2019s unfair business practices. Much of his oratory has involved old-fashioned smokestack industries like steel \u2014 industries in which the jobs were already disappearing even before the rise of China.\nBut economists and business groups warn that China\u2019s industrial ambitions have entered a new, far-reaching phase. With its deep government pockets, growing technical sophistication and a comprehensive plan to free itself from dependence on foreign companies, China aims to become dominant in industries of the future like renewable energy, big data and self-driving cars.\nWith solar, it has already happened. China is now home to two-thirds of the world\u2019s solar-production capacity. The efficiency with which its products convert sunlight into electricity is increasingly close to that of panels made by American, German and South Korean companies. Because China also buys half of the world\u2019s new solar panels, it now effectively controls the market.\nFor much of the past century, the ups and downs of the American economy could spell the difference between employment or poverty for people like Chilean copper miners and Malaysian rubber farmers. Now China\u2019s policy shifts and business decisions can have the same kind of global impact once wielded by power brokers in Washington, New York and Detroit.\nThe story of China\u2019s rise in solar panels illustrates the profound difficulties the country presents to Mr. Trump, or to any American president. Its size and fast-moving economy give it the ability to redefine industries almost on a dime. Its government-led pursuit of dominance in crucial industries presents a direct challenge to countries where leaders generally leave business decisions to the businesses themselves.\nAlready, China is the world\u2019s largest maker and buyer of steel, cars and smartphones. While it does not necessarily dominate those industries, its government ministries are moving to replicate that success with robots, chips and software \u2014 just as in solar.\nChinese panel makers \u201chave the capital, they have the technology, they have the scale,\u201d said Ocean Yuan, the chief executive of Grape Solar, a distributor of solar panels based in Eugene, Ore. Of American rivals, he said, \u201cthey will crush them.\u201d\nBefore he became one of the solar industry\u2019s most powerful players, Liu Hanyuan raised fish.\nThe son of peasants from China\u2019s hardscrabble southwest, Mr. Liu sold some of the family\u2019s pigs in 1983 for what was then around $100 to buy some fish. Soon he went into the even more lucrative business of selling fish feed, and he eventually moved into pig feed and duck feed. The brand name, Keli, is a combination of the first and last Chinese characters from a famous paraphrasing of Karl Marx by Deng Xiaoping, the father of modern China: Science and technology are primary productive forces.\nAccording to Mr. Liu\u2019s authorized biography, he faced local criticism at first for his early embrace of capitalism, and responded by saying that his fish feed was an improved product that followed Deng\u2019s dictum. \u201cWhen my business grows bigger,\u201d he said at the time, \u201cI will build another floor for labs.\u201d\nPlans to shift into computer chips did not pan out, so by 2006, he shifted to solar technology, after taking control of a company that made chemicals for the production of polysilicon, the crystalline raw material for solar panels. That move proved fortunate: China was just then embarking on a concerted effort to become a solar-industry powerhouse.\nOver the next six years, Beijing pushed state-owned banks to provide at least $18 billion in loans at low-interest rates to solar-panel manufacturers, and encouraged local governments to subsidize them with cheap land. China had more on its mind than just dominating solar exports: Its severe pollution problems and concerns that rising sea levels from climate change could devastate its teeming coastal cities lent urgency to efforts to develop green technology. At the same time, China also became a major player in wind power through similar policies.\nWith ample assistance, China\u2019s solar-power production capacity expanded more than tenfold from 2007 to 2012. Now six of the top 10 solar-panel makers are Chinese, including the top two, compared with none a decade ago. The solar division of Mr. Liu\u2019s company, the Tongwei Group, which discloses few financial details, is one of the fastest-expanding players in the industry.\nThat growth forced many American and European solar-panel manufacturers into a headlong retreat. Two dozen of them filed for bankruptcy or cut back operations during President Barack Obama\u2019s first term, damaging the heady optimism then about clean energy.\nIn 2012 and 2013, the United States and the European Union concluded that Chinese solar-panel makers were collecting government subsidies and dumping panels, or selling them for less than the cost of producing and shipping them. Both imposed import limits. Chinese manufacturers and officials denied improper subsidies and dumping, and still do.\nSeveral large Chinese manufacturers that had previously overexpanded and had been selling at heavy losses for years then closed their doors. But Western solar companies say Chinese banks still lent heavily to the survivors despite low loan-recovery rates from the defaults of big Chinese solar companies like Suntech, Chaori and LDK Solar.\n\u201cThe main subsidy is massive, below-market loans by Chinese state-owned commercial banks to finance new capacity and also the massive ongoing losses of Chinese companies,\u201d said J\u00fcrgen Stein, the president of American operations for SolarWorld, a big German panel maker.\nLi Junfeng, a top architect of China\u2019s renewable-energy policies until he retired from that responsibility in early January, said that the West had exaggerated the role of the state in helping to finance Chinese solar-panel manufacturers. \u201cThe market can decide for itself,\u201d he said. \u201cThe good companies can get money, the bad companies cannot.\u201d\nLike the Chinese solar industry as a whole, Tongwei is thinking bigger.\nMr. Liu\u2019s company bought an enormous solar-panel manufacturing complex in central China in 2013 from LDK Solar, which had run into severe financial difficulties. Now it plans to build factories of five gigawatts apiece in the Chinese cities of Chengdu and Hefei. By comparison, the entire global market is only about 77 gigawatts each year, while world capacity is 139 gigawatts.\nAt the same time, Mr. Liu is dismissive of companies in the West that pioneered many solar technologies but have lost their market shares to China. \u201cThey are very jealous,\u201d he said, \u201cand cannot catch up with China\u2019s pace.\u201d\nFrom an environmental standpoint, China\u2019s solar push has been good for the world. Solar-panel prices have fallen close to 90 percent over the past decade. Many of the solar panels in America\u2019s backyards and solar power plants are made by Chinese companies.\nBut for the solar industry, Chinese expansion could mean an extended period of low prices and cutbacks for everybody else.\n\u201cThe solar industry is facing again, I would say, a new winter,\u201d said Patrick Pouyann\u00e9, the chairman and chief executive of Total, the French oil and gas giant, which owns a controlling stake in SunPower, an American solar-panel maker.\nChina now hopes to replicate its solar industry\u2019s growth in other areas.\nUnder a plan called Made in China 2025, China hopes to become largely self-sufficient within seven years in a long list of industries, including aircraft, high-speed trains, computer chips and robots. The plan echoes the solar-panel and wind-turbine buildup a decade ago, but with a larger checkbook. Made in China 2025 calls for roughly $300 billion in financial backing: inexpensive loans from state-owned banks, investment funds to acquire foreign technologies, and extensive research subsidies.\nIf successful, Made in China 2025 would represent a fundamental shift in how China deals with the world. Initially, most of the industries that moved to China, such as shoe and clothing production, were already leaving the United States anyway. Heavy industries such as steel followed. While the shift was profound \u2014 some economists estimate that up to 2.4 million American jobs were lost to China from 1999 to 2011, though others dispute that analysis \u2014 China has struggled in some areas like autos to create viable global competitors.\nAmerican and European business groups have warned that the China 2025 plan means that a much wider range of Western businesses will face the same kind of government-backed competition that has already transformed the solar industry.\n\u201cThe policies started in solar and are now starting to infect the higher reaches of the economy with Made in China 2025,\u201d said Jeremie Waterman, the president of the China Center at the United States Chamber of Commerce in Washington.\nIn the end, China did not slash subsidies for rooftop solar panels, and cut them only slightly for large power-plant arrays. But prices barely rebounded from last year\u2019s slump.\nMr. Gao, of Wuhan, is a slender 37-year-old whose dark hair is already thinning. He said that his business had depended not on homeowners but on profit-minded investors who made use of the subsidies.\nThe investors would pay three-fifths of the cost of a homeowner\u2019s system. The homeowner would take only enough electricity from the panels to power the home. The investor would sell the rest of the electricity to the grid at a high, government-assisted price.\nThe suggestion that the government might cut the subsidy, even though the government did not follow through on it, panicked his investors. So they stopped financing further deals.\n\u201cThey fear that the year after next, they may have nothing,\u201d he said. He recently hired four more employees to drum up sales, even as installations creep along at a small fraction of demand a year ago.\nIn Perrysburg, Mr. Abney lost his job at First Solar, the largest solar-panel manufacturer based in the United States, and looked in vain for a job in the auto industry in the Toledo area. He ended up taking a job three weeks ago at a building materials company in Lancaster, Pa. His daughter is going off to college in the autumn, while his wife and son, a high school freshman now, will follow him to central Pennsylvania this summer.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hardest on him because we\u2019re pulling him away from his high school and his activities,\u201d Mr. Abney said.\nFirst Solar struggled with improving Chinese technology as well as dropping prices.\nIt laid off workers in Perrysburg partly because it decided not to produce its Series 5 generation of panels, which represented a limited improvement over its existing Series 4 panels. First Solar, to better compete with Chinese producers, will wait for its lower-cost, high-efficiency Series 6 panels to be ready for production in 2018. In the end, First Solar, which is based in Tempe, Ariz., laid off 1,600 people worldwide.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just kind of a shock factor when a lot of families realize they\u2019re no longer going to have a job,\u201d said Michael Olmstead, the Republican mayor of Perrysburg.\nThough Mr. Abney has started his new job at almost the same pay as his previous one, he says part of him pined for the days when the United States still led in solar energy, and when First Solar was at the forefront of that leadership.\n\u201cThey were good for us,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it was great while it lasted.\u201d", "date": "April 8, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/08/business/china-trade-solar-panels.html", "tags": "panels job china solar-panel business solar \u201d became chinese killers"}
