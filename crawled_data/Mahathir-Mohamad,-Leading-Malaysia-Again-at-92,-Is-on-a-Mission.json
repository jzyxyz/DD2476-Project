{"title": "Mahathir Mohamad, Leading Malaysia Again at 92, Is on a Mission", "content": "PUTRAJAYA, Malaysia \u2014 Racing to figure out the depth of the fiscal crisis that awaited him after his inauguration, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and his aides first entered the Malaysian government offices last month to find an alarming sight: oversize garbage bags filled with shredded documents, a snowstorm of loose papers on the floor, even half-consumed food left by former occupants in a hurry to get out.\nAt the Finance Ministry down the street, Lim Guan Eng, Malaysia\u2019s new finance minister, found computers in which even the highest-ranking bureaucrats were locked out of certain accounts. In some cases, vital files were accessible only to a single person: Najib Razak, the nation\u2019s scandal-tainted former prime minister, who had also served as finance minister.\nEvidence of financial malfeasance by Mr. Najib and his cronies helped Mr. Mahathir\u2019s opposition alliance win national elections on May 9, unseating a political force that had governed Malaysia since it gained independence in 1957. But the euphoria surrounding a historic democratic transition has given way to a more sobering reality.\nEven without piecing together a single shredded document, Mr. Mahathir, who previously served as prime minister from 1981 to 2003, has discovered that the country is in far worse financial shape than he and his allies had feared. The national debt, tallied at $170 billion by Mr. Najib\u2019s administration, has been reassessed, along with other government liabilities, at $250 billion. That is 80 percent of Malaysia\u2019s gross domestic product.\n\u201cThe more we look into the previous administration, the more bad things we find,\u201d Mr. Mahathir said in an interview in the grand, Islamic-style prime minister\u2019s office in Putrajaya, the administrative capital he helped design in the late 1990s. \u201cAny organization that had money, the previous government found the means to take the money.\u201d\nThe United States Department of Justice has already accused Mr. Najib, Mr. Mahathir\u2019s one-time prot\u00e9g\u00e9, of siphoning $731 million from the country\u2019s investment fund into his personal bank accounts. At least $4.5 billion is believed to have been diverted from that fund, known as 1Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB.\nBut the claims of theft from national coffers extend beyond 1MDB to encompass an astonishing array of government-funded initiatives, from a rural development program and a plan for religious pilgrims to a provident fund and a coal mine in Mongolia.\n\u201cAll have been raped by the previous government,\u201d said Mr. Mahathir, who defected from the governing alliance two years ago. \u201cThey have taken money. Now they have lost the money.\u201d\nMr. Lim, an accountant and former banking executive, was equally direct. \u201cThey were just robbing the country blind,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m having nightmares practically every day, wondering what land mines will I tread on the following day.\u201d\nIf Mr. Mahathir\u2019s Alliance of Hope had not scored its surprise victory in the elections last month, Mr. Lim said, \u201cthe nation would have become a basket case.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cWe would be at a terminal stage.\u201d\nCoaxing the nation back to health depends on Mr. Mahathir, whose first tenure as prime minister was marked as much by his authoritarian impulses as his success in shepherding Malaysia\u2019s transformation into a upper-middle-income country. During his 22 years in power, Mr. Mahathir was accused by critics of playing race politics, muzzling the news media and locking up his enemies.\nYet even Mr. Mahathir\u2019s former detractors contend that he is a changed man, cognizant of how unchecked power in the wrong hands can devastate a country.\n\u201cHe has mellowed, and unlike his first time in office, he has now realized that independent institutions are not a bad thing,\u201d said James Chin, the Malaysian-born director of the Asia Institute at the University of Tasmania. \u201cPreviously, he was all about centralization of power in the prime minister\u2019s office.\u201d\nThat assessment is shared by those whose political careers he once derailed. Mr. Lim, the current finance minister, was imprisoned twice during Mr. Mahathir\u2019s previous time in office.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s Mahathir version 2.0,\u201d Mr. Lim said of his new boss. \u201cI think it\u2019s very different from the version 1.0 we saw when he first became prime minister. He\u2019s more reformist.\u201d\nHe is also a man in a hurry. Mr. Mahathir is unquestionably Malaysia\u2019s most charismatic and popular politician, but he will turn 93 next month. Mr. Mahathir has committed to eventually handing power to Anwar Ibrahim, the longtime leader of the opposition who was in prison during the recent elections.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a man with a mission, driven by the need to get things done in the shortest possible time,\u201d Mr. Lim said. \u201cHe\u2019s moving at a frenetic pace.\u201d\nBut Malaysia\u2019s political malaise cannot be traced only to the nine years that Mr. Najib was in power.\n\u201cThe state in which the country is today is not just the result of Najib Razak\u2019s misgovernance but also decades of populist politics and semi-authoritarian practices,\u201d said Sophie Lemi\u00e8re, a Malaysia specialist at the Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation at Harvard University.\nMr. Mahathir acknowledged that cleansing a political machine riddled with corruption, not to mention aiding at least six national governments that are investigating missing 1MDB funds, has proved taxing. \u201cWe have asked so many people to resign we are left with a skeleton,\u201d Mr. Mahathir said.\nBut he refused to acknowledge any systemic faults with the Malaysian political system, instead blaming Mr. Najib\u2019s astonishing greed for the nation\u2019s predicament. Police raids last month on properties associated with Mr. Najib and his family turned up $28.6 million in cash and more than 430 designer handbags.\n\u201cIt is obvious that he has stolen money,\u201d Mr. Mahathir said, indicating that his government had already accumulated \u201cenough evidence\u201d to have Mr. Najib and his wife, Rosmah Mansor, put on trial. The two have been barred from leaving the country.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of seeking revenge,\u201d Mr. Mahathir said. \u201cIt is just the application of the rule of law.\u201d\nMr. Mahathir, long known as a workaholic, has kept to a schedule that would be punishing for a leader half his age. This week, he made his first foreign trip, to Japan, to court investors who could counter China\u2019s hold on the Malaysian economy. After returning late Tuesday, he woke up before dawn to pray. He has been fasting for the holy month of Ramadan.\nMr. Mahathir\u2019s mental agility appears uncompromised, and his judgments are as pointed as ever. He has shown little patience for President Trump, who welcomed Mr. Najib to the White House last year and once called him his \u201cfavorite prime minister.\u201d\n\u201cI have no plans to go and see him,\u201d Mr. Mahathir said of Mr. Trump, whom he called \u201cvolatile.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know how I can deal with a person who is so much like a chameleon.\u201d\nMr. Mahathir has already distanced himself from his vow to hand over power within two years to Mr. Anwar, his onetime deputy who was released last month from prison. After all, Mr. Mahathir joked, he had suggested that time frame only because some thought he might become senile at age 95.\nMr. Anwar has been jailed twice, once during Mr. Mahathir\u2019s tenure, after the two fell out. Yet Mr. Mahathir refused to accept that Mr. Anwar\u2019s conviction for sodomy and corruption was in any way politically motivated. The police were the ones who pursued the case, he said in the interview \u2014 though at the time, in 1998, he publicly said that \u201cI cannot accept a man who is a sodomist as leader of the country,\u201d and that he felt that Mr. Anwar had challenged his leadership.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t do it. It was done in the proper way,\u201d Mr. Mahathir insisted on Wednesday. \u201cIt was up to the judge to decide whether there was a case or not.\u201d\nMr. Lim, the finance minister, admitted that Mr. Mahathir had never expressed regret for jailing him \u2014 but also said it was vital not to let old grievances fester.\n\u201cI forgive, but that doesn\u2019t mean I will forget,\u201d Mr. Lim said. \u201cI think the most important thing is to look forward.\u201d\nAs for Malaysia\u2019s new prime minister, who now has a rare opportunity to reshape his legacy, transform himself into a democratic icon and erase his strongman reputation, Mr. Mahathir refuses to engage in sentimentality.\n\u201cWhen you die, they rewrite your story,\u201d he said. \u201cSo when I am not around, they can say what they like.\u201d", "date": "June 14, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/14/world/asia/malaysia-mahathir-mohamad.html", "tags": "minister malaysia \u201c mohamad prime mahathir lim najib mission leading"}
