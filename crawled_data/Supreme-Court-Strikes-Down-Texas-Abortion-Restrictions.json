{"title": "Supreme Court Strikes Down Texas Abortion Restrictions", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday reaffirmed and strengthened constitutional protections for abortion rights, striking down parts of a restrictive Texas law that could have drastically reduced the number of abortion clinics in the state, leaving them only in the largest metropolitan areas.\nThe 5-to-3 decision was the court\u2019s most sweeping statement on abortion since Planned Parenthood v. Casey in 1992, which reaffirmed the constitutional right to abortion established in 1973 in Roe v. Wade. It found that Texas\u2019 restrictions \u2014 requiring doctors to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals and clinics to meet the standards of ambulatory surgical centers \u2014 violated Casey\u2019s prohibition on placing an \u201cundue burden\u201d on the ability to obtain an abortion.\nIf Casey limited the right established in Roe, allowing states to regulate abortion in ways Roe had barred, Monday\u2019s decision effectively expanded that right. It means that similar requirements in other states are most likely also unconstitutional, and it imperils many other kinds of restrictions on abortion. It is also sure to energize anti-abortion forces and make abortion a central issue in the presidential campaign.\nThe decision concerned two parts of a  law that imposed strict requirements on abortion providers in Texas signed into law in July 2013 by Rick Perry, the governor at the time.\nOne required all clinics in the state to meet the standards for ambulatory surgical centers, including regulations concerning buildings, equipment and staffing. The other required doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital.\n\u201cWe conclude,\u201d Justice Stephen G. Breyer wrote for the majority, \u201cthat neither of these provisions offers medical benefits sufficient to justify the burdens upon access that each imposes. Each places a substantial obstacle in the path of women seeking a previability abortion, each constitutes an undue burden on abortion access, and each violates the federal Constitution.\u201d\nJustices Anthony M. Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan joined the majority opinion. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. dissented.\nJustice Kennedy\u2019s vote was the crucial one, and it came as a relief to abortion rights groups, which have long viewed his thinking on the issue as a contradictory muddle.\nIn the Casey decision, he joined Justices Sandra Day O\u2019Connor and David H. Souter in a joint opinion that reaffirmed the core of Roe v. Wade. But Justice Kennedy\u2019s reputation as an abortion rights champion had otherwise been undeserved, said David S. Cohen, a law professor at Drexel University, as Casey was the only case in which he had found an abortion restriction unconstitutional in his 28 years on the Supreme Court.\nProfessor Cohen said Justice Kennedy\u2019s vote in Monday\u2019s case was a puzzle. He may have been swayed by the burdens placed on women having to drive hundreds of miles to obtain abortions, Professor Cohen said, or by the lack of medical evidence justifying the restrictions \u2014 or both.\nMany states have enacted restrictions in recent years that test the limits of the constitutional right to abortion, and the ruling in the new case, Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt, No. 15-274, enunciated principles that will apply to all of the ones said to be justified by a concern for women\u2019s health.\nIn a message posted on Twitter, President Obama said he was \u201cpleased to see the Supreme Court reaffirm\u201d that \u201cevery woman has a constitutional right to make her own reproductive choices.\u201d\nKen Paxton, Texas\u2019 attorney general, said, \u201cThe court is becoming a default medical board for the nation, with no deference being given to state law.\u201d\nThe Texas law was passed in 2013 by the Republican-dominated Texas Legislature and turned a Democratic state senator, Wendy Davis, who conducted an 11-hour filibuster against the law, into a national political star.\nLast June, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, largely upheld the contested provisions of the Texas law, saying it had to accept lawmakers\u2019 assertions about the health benefits of abortion restrictions. The appeals court ruled that the law, with minor exceptions, did not place an undue burden on the right to abortion.\nJustice Breyer said the appeals court\u2019s approach was at odds with the proper application of the undue-burden standard. The Casey decision, he said, \u201crequires that courts consider the burdens a law imposes on abortion access together with the benefits those laws confer.\u201d\nIn dissent, Justice Thomas said the majority opinion \u201creimagines the undue-burden standard,\u201d creating a \u201cbenefits-and-burdens balancing test.\u201d He said courts should resolve conflicting positions by deferring to legislatures.\n\u201cToday\u2019s opinion,\u201d Justice Thomas wrote, \u201cdoes resemble Casey in one respect: After disregarding significant aspects of the court\u2019s prior jurisprudence, the majority applies the undue-burden standard in a way that will surely mystify lower courts for years to come.\u201d\nThe majority opinion considered whether the claimed benefits of the restrictions outweighed the burdens they placed on a constitutional right. Justice Breyer wrote that there was no evidence that the admitting-privileges requirement \u201cwould have helped even one woman obtain better treatment.\u201d\nAt the same time, he wrote, there was good evidence that the admitting-privileges requirement caused the number of abortion clinics in Texas to drop from 40 to 20.\nIn a second dissent, Justice Alito, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Thomas, said the causal link between the law and the closings was unproven. Withdrawal of state funds, a decline in the demand for abortions and doctors\u2019 retirements may have played a role, Justice Alito wrote.\nJustice Breyer wrote that the requirement that abortion clinics meet the demanding and elaborate standards for ambulatory surgical centers also did more harm than good.\n\u201cAbortions taking place in an abortion facility are safe \u2014 indeed, safer than numerous procedures that take place outside hospitals and to which Texas does not apply its surgical-center requirements,\u201d he wrote, reviewing the evidence. \u201cNationwide, childbirth is 14 times more likely than abortion to result in death, but Texas law allows a midwife to oversee childbirth in the patient\u2019s own home.\u201d\nIn dissent, Justice Alito said there was good reason to think that the restrictions were meant to protect women. \u201cThe law was one of many enacted by states in the wake of the Kermit Gosnell scandal, in which a physician who ran an abortion clinic in Philadelphia was convicted for the first degree murder of three infants who were born alive and for the manslaughter of a patient,\u201d he wrote.\nJustice Breyer acknowledged that \u201cGosnell\u2019s behavior was terribly wrong.\u201d\n\u201cBut,\u201d he added, \u201cthere is no reason to believe that an extra layer of regulation would have affected that behavior.\u201d\nThe clinics challenging the law said it had already caused about half the state\u2019s 41 abortion clinics to close. If the contested provisions had taken full effect, they said, the number of clinics would again be cut in half.\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision rippled through the presidential campaign, with Democrats and Republicans looking to rally voters with reminders that the future of the court is at stake.\nThe next president will have at least one and potentially several vacancies to fill, and Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump have both warned that the fate of laws on immigration, guns and abortion will most likely be determined by who gets to fill those openings.\nMrs. Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, seized on the court\u2019s ruling to warn that Mr. Trump, her Republican opponent, poses a threat to women. She recalled his suggestion this year that abortion should be banned and that women who violate that ban should be penalized. She also said that with other states also seeking to restrict access to abortions and with Republicans seeking to defund Planned Parenthood, proponents of abortions rights could not afford to let up.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a concerted, persistent attack on women\u2019s health and rights at the federal level,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said in a statement. \u201cMeanwhile, Donald Trump has said women should be punished for having abortions.\u201d\nMr. Trump has since retracted his assertion that women should be punished for having abortions, but the re-emergence of the issue is likely to put him on the defensive because of his previous support of abortion rights.\nMr. Trump made no direct public comments on Monday\u2019s decision.\nStill, for many Republicans, the decision added urgency to their desire to keep Mrs. Clinton from winning the presidency.\n\u201cToday\u2019s disappointing decision is another reminder of what\u2019s at stake in this election and why we can\u2019t afford to let Hillary Clinton win,\u201d Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, said.", "date": "June 27, 2016", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/28/us/supreme-court-texas-abortion.html", "tags": "restrictions court \u201d supreme justice women abortion strikes decision law texas"}
