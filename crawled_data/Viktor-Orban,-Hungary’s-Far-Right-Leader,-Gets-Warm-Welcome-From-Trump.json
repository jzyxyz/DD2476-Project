Respected all over Europe. Probably like me, a little bit controversial, but that\u2019s O.K. That\u2019s O.K. You\u2019ve done a good job, and you\u2019ve kept your country safe.\u201d\nFor Mr. Orban, the American president\u2019s embrace was a welcome affirmation, not to mention a striking contrast to the chilly reception he often gets from European leaders who see him as a threat to their vision of a modern, integrated and pluralistic continent. Mr. Orban has vowed to build \u201can alternative to liberal democracy,\u201d casting himself as a defender of a Christian homeland against Muslim migrants.\nMr. Orban is just the latest of the world\u2019s strongmen to find a warm reception in Mr. Trump\u2019s White House. The president has hosted or praised autocrats from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the Philippines and Kazakhstan, \u201cfell in love\u201d with North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-un and upended his entire Syria policy after a phone call with Turkey\u2019s iron-fisted leader, triggering the resignation in protest of his own defense secretary.\nEven as he sat next to Mr. Orban on Monday in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump announced that he will meet with two other authoritarian leaders, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and President Xi Jinping of China, on the sidelines of a Group of 20 economic summit meeting next month in Osaka, Japan.\nMr. Trump canceled his last scheduled meeting with Mr. Putin after Russian forces seized three Ukrainian ships, declaring that he would reschedule \u201cas soon as this situation is resolved.\u201d The situation remains unresolved, but it no longer appears to be an obstacle to a meeting with Mr. Putin.\nLikewise, Mr. Trump is in the midst of a high-stakes showdown with Mr. Xi over trade and tariffs, which he may use the meeting next month to address. But he has taken no action in response to reports that China is detaining one million or more Uighur Muslims in so-called re-education camps.\nAmerican government officials and human rights groups have long criticized Mr. Orban\u2019s policies and statements, but Mr. Trump disregarded their concerns in inviting him to the Oval Office, something President Barack Obama refused to do. Trump administration officials argued that engagement was a better approach than estrangement, saying that they have raised concerns about Mr. Orban\u2019s policies at lower levels.\nYet ignoring Republican and Democratic senators, who urged him to address such issues himself, Mr. Trump expressed no qualms about Mr. Orban\u2019s approach during their appearance before reporters on Monday and welcomed him as a leader fighting illegal immigration and defending Christian culture.\n\u201cI know he\u2019s a tough man, but he\u2019s a respected man and he\u2019s done the right thing, according to many people, on immigration,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAnd you look at some of the problems that they have in Europe that are tremendous because they\u2019ve done it a different way than the prime minister.\u201d\nSome American analysts and government veterans said Mr. Trump appeared to be endorsing Mr. Orban and giving away one of a president\u2019s most valued offerings \u2014 the prestige of a White House visit \u2014 without extracting any concessions.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure what we\u2019re getting out of it,\u201d said Heather A. Conley, the senior vice president for Europe at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former State Department official under President George W. Bush. \u201cWe\u2019re having meetings, but for what? Why are we doing it? What\u2019s missing is a well thought out strategy.\u201d\nOnce a leader in the move to adopt Western values when the Soviet bloc collapsed three decades ago, Hungary has taken a different turn since Mr. Orban assumed office in 2010. His government has targeted nongovernmental organizations, brought most of the news media under control of his allies, undermined the independent judiciary, altered the electoral process to favor his party and is driving out of the country an American-chartered university founded by the billionaire George Soros.\nDavid B. Cornstein, a longtime friend of Mr. Trump\u2019s and his ambassador to Hungary, suggested recently that the president envied Mr. Orban. \u201cI can tell you, knowing the president for a good 25 or 30 years, that he would love to have the situation that Viktor Orban has, but he doesn\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Cornstein told The Atlantic.\nFor his part, Mr. Orban cast himself as a Hungarian Trump on Monday. \u201cWe have some similar approaches,\u201d Mr. Orban said. \u201cAnd I would like to express that we are proud to stand together with the United States on fighting against illegal migration, on terrorism and to protect and help the Christian communities all around the world.\u201d\nMr. Trump then added: \u201cAnd you have been great with respect to Christian communities. You have really put a block up, and we appreciate that very much.\u201d\nAsked about democracy in Hungary, Mr. Orban dismissed the question with a single sentence: \u201cWe have a new Constitution, accepted in 2011, and it\u2019s functioning well.\u201d\nMr. Trump interjected to defend Mr. Orban. \u201cDon\u2019t forget they\u2019re a member of NATO and a very good member of NATO,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think we can really go into too much of a discussion unless that\u2019s mentioned.\u201d\nThe president made no mention of the fact that Hungary spends only 1.15 percent of its economy on defense, one of the proportionately lowest in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, even though he regularly excoriates other leaders for not meeting the 2 percent goal set by the alliance. Likewise, he said nothing about Hungary\u2019s increasing energy ties with Russia, unlike his repeated criticism of Germany on the same issue. Nor did he publicly raise American discontent with the Chinese firm Huawei\u2019s work on Hungary\u2019s broadband network.\nHungary\u2019s vast pro-government media network, which includes public media and scores of nominally private media outlets controlled by the prime minister\u2019s allies, lauded Mr. Orban\u2019s visit to the White House as validation of the prime minister\u2019s politics and gravitas in global politics.\nA home-page article on Origo made the case that Mr. Orban\u2019s invitation to the White House \u201cis a clear message to the elite in Brussels\u201d that Mr. Trump sees opportunities to strengthen trans-Atlantic relations beyond relations with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, President Emmanuel Macron of France and Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission.\nWhile Mr. Orban has sought a meeting with Mr. Trump for the past couple of years, he was the last of the Central European leaders to be granted one, and only with the help of well-connected Washington lobbyists. But pro-government media in Hungary reported that the timing was not coincidental, suggesting that it amounted to an endorsement of Mr. Orban before the European Parliament elections this month.\nFormer Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the early front-runner for the Democratic nomination to challenge Mr. Trump next year, said the president should raise concerns with Mr. Orban, including his tilt toward Russia.\n\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d Mr. Biden said in a statement, \u201cgiven Trump\u2019s habit of fawning praise for authoritarian leaders \u2014 and Putin in particular \u2014 we don\u2019t have any confidence that he\u2019ll be up to the task.\u201d", "date": "May 13, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/13/us/politics/trump-viktor-orban-oval-office.html", "tags": "\u201c hungary president orban meeting trump welcome gets leader far-right \u2014 viktor warm"}
