{"title": "Calvert DeForest, 85, Larry (Bud) Melman on \u2018Letterman,\u2019 Dies", "content": "Calvert G. DeForest, the dweebish  man who gained cult status on David Letterman\u2019s late-night shows as the comic figure Larry (Bud) Melman precisely because he was not funny, died Monday in Babylon, Long Island. He was 85.\nHe suffered from a long illness,  according to a statement by Mr. Letterman, on whose shows Mr. DeForest appeared dozens of times.\nFor 20 years Mr. DeForest drew laughs simply for being the odd juxtaposition in an industry marked by smooth personalities and slender bodies. His appearances on Mr. Letterman\u2019s shows ranged from being a \u201ccorrespondent\u201d at the Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway, to handing out hot towels at the Port Authority bus terminal in Manhattan, to doing bad impersonations of Ronald Reagan, Barbra Streisand and Elvis Presley.\n\u201cEveryone always wondered if Calvert was an actor playing a character, but in reality he was just himself \u2014 a genuine, modest and nice man,\u201d Mr. Letterman said in his statement.\nMr. DeForest\u2019s late-blossoming television career began with a New York University student film project called \u201cKing of the Zs,\u201d by future Letterman writers, Stephen Winer and Karl Tiedemann who brought him along when they joined the Late Night staff. At the time, Mr. DeForest was working as a file clerk at a drug rehabilitation center. He was picked up by a black limousine, given his stage name, and became the first image of \u201cLate Night With David Letterman,\u201d before the opening credits on the debut episode.\nIn 1993, when Mr. Letterman decided to switch to CBS and the show became the \u201cLate Show With David Letterman,\u201d Mr. DeForest came along, but his character\u2019s name did not. In an intellectual property dispute, NBC claimed ownership of the Larry (Bud) Melman name, even though it had been devised by a \u201cLetterman\u201d writer, Merrill Markoe. From the moment his face appeared as the center of the CBS eye logo on the debut CBS show, Mr. DeForest used his own name. He parlayed his \u201cLetterman\u201d fame into other film roles and commercials for a wide range of companies including M.C.I., Honda, Cheerios and Pizza Hut. His last appearance on \u201cLetterman\u201d celebrated his birthday in 2002.\nMr. DeForest was born on July 23, 1921, in Brooklyn to Calvert Martin DeForest, a doctor, and Mabelle Taylor, who briefly worked as an actress. He graduated from Poly Preparatory Country Day School in Brooklyn and always wanted to be an actor. His mother discouraged that ambition, and instead he spent many years working at Parke-Davis Pharmaceuticals. When his mother died, he began volunteering for backstage work on local stage productions, which led to performance work in front of the curtain.\nMr. DeForest leaves no immediate survivors.", "date": "MARCH 22, 2007", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/22/arts/television/22defo.html", "tags": "\u2018 name david melman bud larry \u201d deforest calvert dies shows late letterman"}
