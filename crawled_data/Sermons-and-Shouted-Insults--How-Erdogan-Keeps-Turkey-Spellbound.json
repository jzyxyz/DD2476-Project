{"title": "Sermons and Shouted Insults: How Erdogan Keeps Turkey Spellbound", "content": "ANKARA, Turkey \u2014 As President Trump has his tweets, the leader of Turkey has his speeches.\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan makes up to three every weekday \u2014 two a day on weekends \u2014 and his charismatic, combative talks are the primary vehicle of his success.\nHe calls democracy advocates \u201cmarauders.\u201d He mocks the German foreign minister as a \u201cdisaster.\u201d He is as comfortable in the vernacular as he is reciting poetry. He takes on his enemies publicly by name, pivoting seamlessly from pious to pushy.\nEven after 15 years at the helm, Mr. Erdogan, whose skills as an orator even his opponents envy, treats every event like a campaign rally \u2014 and he turns just about every day into one. He remains the country\u2019s most popular politician and is poised to seek re-election, possibly this year, with polling showing him with over 40 percent support.\nMuch of that appeal can be credited to his ubiquitous media presence and a speaking style that supporters find inspiring, and detractors divisive. Neither side doubts that it has struck a chord with Turkey\u2019s conservative working class.\nIn that regard, Mr. Erdogan fits perfectly with the deepening global trend toward autocrats and swaggering strongmen (they are all men) who have found a way to speak forcefully for common people who feel their point of view has been ignored for too long.\nMr. Erdogan\u2019s speeches are often broadcast live on multiple television channels, almost universally pro-government, from every event he attends. His voice is heard everywhere, in cafes, homes and government offices across the land.\nHis favorite recipe: attacking people his supporters love to hate, be it the United States, European leaders or the liberal elite.\nTo his support base, Mr. Erdogan talks like a father, a brother, or the man next door. \u201cHe is one of us,\u201d supporters often explain. And he says what he thinks, in salty, everyday language, just like them.\n\u201cAnd now they have a foreign minister \u2014 oh, my God \u2014 what a disaster,\u201d Mr. Erdogan railed to supporters in the western region of Denizli last summer, at the height of his country\u2019s tensions with Germany.\n\u201cHe never knows his place,\u201d Mr. Erdogan continued. \u201cWho are you \u2014 Ha! \u2014 speaking to the president of Turkey? You are talking to the foreign minister of Turkey. Know your place.\u201d\n\u201cAnd he attempts to give us a lesson. What is your history in politics? How old are you? Our life passed with those struggles in politics.\u201d\nThe passage was vintage Erdogan. \u201cStylistically he is always full of surprises,\u201d said Asli Aydintasbas, a former journalist and senior fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cHe does not mind shocking people, and taking people on in a very public manner.\u201d\nOften that means upsetting people that his supporters do not like. He jeered at pro-democracy protesters in Istanbul for their liberal lifestyle, calling them \u201cmarauders\u201d and mocking their drinking habits: \u201cThey drink until they puke.\u201d\nAnd he made a notoriously coarse remark about a socialist feminist protester who climbed onto an armored vehicle in Ankara, wondering if she were a girl or a woman, essentially questioning her virginity.\nBut Mr. Erdogan also inspires with poetry and tales of the life of the Prophet Muhammad. He drops his voice with reverence to honor fallen soldiers, and then raises it to stir national pride.\nThe religious sermonizing is very much part of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s training. He studied at a religious school for prayer leaders and preachers, learning among his courses Islamic preaching.\nLiberals and secularists have often criticized his divisive speech, and his introduction of religion into politics, yet it is what most of his pious Muslim followers want to hear.\n\u201cFor conservatives this is someone defending their lifestyle,\u201d Ms. Aydintasbas said.\nA smooth practitioner with a teleprompter, he has a well-honed rhetorical style. In almost every speech there is a moment when he shakes up the audience, suddenly switching gears.\nHe turns from declarative speech to address directly, in imperative or interrogative style, whoever is the target of the day.\nHe has been particularly irritated by the United States\u2019 alliance in Syria with the People\u2019s Protection Units, or Y.P.G., a Kurdish group that Turkey says is linked to terrorism.\n\u201cHey America! How many times I have told you?\u201d he railed in a speech last year. \u201cAre you with us, or are you with this terror group?\u201d\nRather than bore his supporters with his political plans, he brings them into the meeting room with him.\n\u201cCan you tolerate what is happening in Ghouta?\u201d he shouted recently, about the Syrian government\u2019s offensive against rebels in a suburb of Damascus. \u201cThe U.N. made a resolution. Damn your resolution! What is the use of your resolution? You are cheating! You are only five,\u201d a reference to the five Security Council members.\nMs. Aydintasbas compares Mr. Erdogan\u2019s speaking style, as well as his relationship to his supporters, with those of President Trump.\n\u201cErdogan\u2019s supporters always say he is genuine,\u201d she said. \u201cIn an age when politics are so well scripted and sanitized in their messaging, it is refreshing when you have anger or even hatred which reflects their own feeling.\u201d\nPolitical opponents who have watched Mr. Erdogan for years concede his talents, even if they dislike his divisive style.\n\u201cHis style is in extreme harmony with the profile of right-wing, populist, authoritarian politicians,\u201d said Ayhan Bilgen, spokesman for the opposition Kurdish party, the People\u2019s Democratic Party. \u201cHe prefers a political style that divides society and escalates tension.\u201d\nMr. Erdogan\u2019s family is originally from Rize, on Turkey\u2019s northeast Black Sea coast, a region famous for its hardheaded characters. He grew up in the rough working-class district of Kasimpasa in Istanbul, playing soccer in the mud with neighborhood kids.\nMr. Bilgen said Mr. Erdogan had always displayed a combative personality from his early days in politics.\n\u201cAlways creating tension, trying to make an argument over everything,\u201d he said, \u201cand in the tension taking control.\u201d\nOnce a week Mr. Erdogan addresses legislators from his Justice and Development Party in the party\u2019s parliamentary chamber. The event less resembles a political meeting than a soccer match \u2014 his supporters wave banners in the galleries and chant competing slogans.\nIn one recent chamber gathering, the loudest cheers Mr. Erdogan raised were when he castigated the United Nations for its unfairness, and sent veiled warnings to the United States about supporting Kurdish groups, in language crafted to inspire Turks by harking back to a heralded past.\n\u201cWe are a country, a nation ready to take any steps any moment,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there are those who prefer a couple of terrorists, marauders against such a nation, such a state, we will no doubt slap this answer in their faces, on their hearts. They should know that.\u201d\nMr. Erdogan has always combined a measure of nationalism with religion and never more so than now, as he champions the Turkish forces that invaded the Syrian enclave of Afrin in January.\nHe returns repeatedly to Islamic themes, frequently citing Turkey\u2019s most beloved poets \u2014 he famously provoked Turkey\u2019s military by reciting a religious poem when mayor of Istanbul in 1997 and ended up in jail.\n\u201cUndoubtedly, the incursion is by us, and victory is from God,\u201d he said recently of the military operation in Syria that captured the city of Afrin.\nHe recited a poem to the unknown soldier:\nThen he called the chamber to pray.\nHe followed with a poem by Mehmet Akif Ersoy, author of Turkey\u2019s national anthem:\nA journalist in the presidential press corps tut-tutted at the religious phrases, rarely heard in Turkey\u2019s institutions in nearly a century of the secular Turkish republic.\nTurkey is divided down the middle \u2014 a referendum last year to grant the president extra powers was split 51 to 49 \u2014 and for all those who are inspired by Mr. Erdogan, just as many are tired of his speeches.\n\u201cHe\u2019s always shouting,\u201d said one shopkeeper in a warren of shops in Istanbul\u2019s back streets. He asked not to be quoted, since people have been arrested for denigrating the president.\nThe opposition politician, Meral Aksener, who is preparing to challenge Mr. Erdogan in the next presidential elections, mocked the president\u2019s endless speeches in a post this month on Twitter.\n\u201cI want to address Mr. Erdogan in your presence,\u201d she said, borrowing his favorite rhetorical trick. \u201cFriend, please keep silent for a moment, spare a little bit time for your family, sit at home,\u201d she said.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to talk about every issue. You don\u2019t have to point your finger everywhere. Sit down at home a little while, have a rest. Take a breath, so we can take breath too, so Turkey can.\u201d", "date": "April 2, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/world/middleeast/erdogan-turkey.html", "tags": "turkey spellbound supporters sermons shouted president \u201d keeps \u2014 insults erdogan"}
