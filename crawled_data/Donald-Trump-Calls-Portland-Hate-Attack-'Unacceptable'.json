The alleged killer, Jeremy Joseph Christian, had harassed the two girls,\u00a0one who is black, and one who is Muslim and was wearing a hijab. Witnesses said the verbal attack appeared to be racially and religiously motivated.\u00a0\u00a0\nChristian allegedly stabbed\u00a0Ricky John Best, 53, and Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche, 23, to death after they intervened on the girls\u2019 behalf. A third man who confronted Christian, 21-year-old Micah David-Cole Fletcher, survived the attack. The three men have been lauded as heroes for standing up for the women.\u00a0\nChristian has been charged with two counts of aggravated murder and other offenses.\u00a0\nOn Friday, the Council on American-Islamic Relations called on Trump to condemn the attack and Islamophobia in general.\u00a0\n\u201cPresident Trump must speak out personally against the rising tide of Islamophobia and other forms of bigotry and racism in our nation that he has provoked through his numerous statements, policies and appointments that have negatively impacted minority communities,\u201d CAIR National Executive Director Nihad Awad said in a statement.\u00a0\u201cOnly a strong statement from the nation\u2019s leader will send a message to bigots that such acts of violence targeting racial, ethnic or religious minorities are unacceptable.\u201d\nIn a report released earlier this month, CAIR said the organization recorded over 2,200 \u201canti-Muslim bias incidents\u201d in 2016, a 57 percent increase from the year before.\u00a0\nThis article has been updated with more background information about the incident and Trump\u2019s tweets.", "date": "\n05/29/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-tweets-portland-hate-attack_n_592c361fe4b0065b20b78893", "tags": "christian portland calls hate twitter \u201d trump donald two girls attack"}
