{"title": "Israeli Minister Wants to Name a Jerusalem Train Station for Trump", "content": "JERUSALEM \u2014 In the uneasy days after President Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, some Israelis who cheered the move paid homage \u2014 and taunted outraged Palestinians \u2014 by posting doctored photos of the Dome of the Rock with the president\u2019s surname plastered across it, as if one of Islam\u2019s holiest shrines had been reduced to the latest gold-plated Trump property.\nNow, a powerful Israeli cabinet minister is offering to express his gratitude by putting Mr. Trump\u2019s name on a proposed new train station in the Old City, one that would bring thousands of tourists directly into the Jewish Quarter just a few hundred yards from the Western Wall and the Temple Mount.\nThe minister, Yisrael Katz, who has responsibility for both transportation and intelligence, has built a can-do reputation for seeing through a wide range of infrastructure projects; he also has designs on the prime minister\u2019s office. Although he has been promoting the idea of a railroad stop in the Old City for over a year, he said on Wednesday that it was now a priority, calling it the \u201cmost important national project being advanced today at the ministry of transport.\u201d\nMr. Katz said he planned to name it for Mr. Trump \u201cfor his courageous and historic decision\u201d and his \u201ccontribution in the strengthening of the status of Jerusalem as the capital of the Jewish people and the state of Israel.\u201d\nBut the plan, which would require digging beneath some of the most sensitive acreage on earth, is sure to invite more international criticism, not to mention further antagonize Palestinians. Despite Mr. Trump\u2019s change in United States policy, announced this month, most of the world does not recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Old City, which Israel captured along with the rest of East Jerusalem in 1967. The United Nations General Assembly voted 128 to 9 last week to condemn Mr. Trump\u2019s decision.\nAhmad Tibi, a leading Arab member of the Knesset, called Mr. Katz\u2019s proposal \u201cpart of the chain reaction to the Trump speech,\u201d which he said had set off \u201ca competition among ministers over who will be more extreme regarding the matter of Jerusalem.\u201d\nAnd Jamal Zahalka, another Arab lawmaker, who said that extending the railroad into the Old City would violate international law by tampering with the status quo in East Jerusalem, said Mr. Katz\u2019s idea of a tribute to Mr. Trump would be especially galling. \u201cFor Palestinians, the name of Trump is worse than the name of Netanyahu,\u201d he said.\nOther Israelis poked fun at Mr. Katz\u2019s idea. \u201cWhy stop with train station, ingrates?\u201d Chemi Shalev, a Haaretz columnist, wrote on Twitter. \u201cKotel should be renamed Trump Wall, and the praying area Ivanka Square.\u201d (Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s elder daughter, converted to Judaism when she married.)\nReaching the Old City by train would require an extension of a new Tel Aviv-to-Jerusalem express railroad that is nearing completion after 15 years and $2 billion in construction. It is meant to cut the commute between Israel\u2019s two largest cities to 28 minutes from over an hour when it opens in the spring.\nExtending it to the Old City would require digging another tunnel two miles long and 170 feet below ground, Mr. Katz\u2019s office said, along with building two new stations \u2014 one near the Dung Gate along the Old City\u2019s southern perimeter, and one beneath the Cardo, the north-south Roman thoroughfare first paved by Emperor Hadrian in the second century, and later extended into what is now the Jewish Quarter by the Byzantine Emperor Justinian.\nIn a statement, Mr. Katz said that a station serving the Kotel, or Western Wall, would \u201cenable Israelis, Jews and tourists from around the world to connect using the fastest, safest way to the beating heart of the Jewish nation \u2014 the Kotel and the Temple Mount.\u201d\nAn adviser to Mr. Katz, Arye Shalicar, said the Old City extension would cost about $715 million and take four to five years. Its route, he said, could be adjusted to satisfy any archaeological concerns.\nHe noted that Mr. Katz had honored Americans before, naming one piece of heavy equipment used in a project in Tel Aviv after Nikki R. Haley, the ambassador to the United Nations, and another after Wonder Woman, the fictional superhero played in the movies by an Israeli actress.\n\u201cIn the end, he\u2019s a politician, and he wants to say thank you \u2014 as a senior politician who wants to be prime minister \u2014 to President Trump, who\u2019s doing something he very much appreciates,\u201d Mr. Shalicar said.", "date": "Dec. 27, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/27/world/middleeast/israeli-yisrael-katz-trump-station.html", "tags": "train minister name \u201c katz city wants trump israeli old jerusalem \u2014 station"}
