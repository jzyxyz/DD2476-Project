{"title": "Senate Republicans Don't Care If Their Tax Bill Is Unpopular", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2015 Senate Republicans look at their tax bill as a key win for the GOP \u2015 a sweeping rewrite that Republicans can point to proudly in upcoming elections. But there\u2019s one big problem lawmakers are ignoring: Voters don\u2019t like the bill.\nIn poll after poll, more voters say they oppose this tax proposal than support it. According to FiveThirtyEight, of the nine largest tax bills over the last 36 years \u2015 two of which were strictly tax increases \u2015 this Republican measure ranks dead last, with its approval rating underwater by an average of 14 points.\nBut that would apparently be news to GOP senators. As they race to pass the bill, they either don\u2019t know, don\u2019t care or don\u2019t trust data suggesting their legislation will be far from a saving grace next November.\nWhen HuffPost asked Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) why the bill has polled so poorly, he said that was because \u201cit hadn\u2019t been written yet.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not through yet,\u201d Cornyn said, noting that Senate Republicans still intend to go to conference over the legislation with the House. But he also said that some of the hostility toward the bill existed because \u201cpeople have just lied about it and misrepresented what\u2019s in it,\u201d and he suggested the polling was faulty.\n\u201cI can show you a poll for anything,\u201d he said.\nThat was a common reaction among Republicans. Rather than their having drafted an unpopular bill, they just think the polls are wrong.\n\u201cDepends on who does the polling,\u201d Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) said Thursday. \u201cI don\u2019t know much about reporting, but I know how to read a poll.\u201d\nKennedy said he had seen polls showing that the bill was \u201cvery popular,\u201d and he suggested there were methodological issues with surveys indicating otherwise. \u201cDepends on how you ask the question. Depends on what your sample is. Depends on whether you use landlines or cell phones,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can make a poll walk, talk, do whatever you want.\u201d\nThere is some variance in polling on the tax bill. But the legislation has consistently tested poorly with the public.\nAt least one GOP senator suggested that it was more important to poll well with Republicans in particular.\n\u201cIt depends on what universe you\u2019re after,\u201d Sen. Jim Inhofe told HuffPost. \u201cIf you\u2019re talking about Republicans, they are for it.\u201d\nInhofe, who comes from the deeply red state of Oklahoma, said this bill was probably the first or second most important piece of legislation to Republicans, particularly those who want President Donald Trump to succeed. And if there was a messaging failure, Inhofe said, it was in Republicans not adequately selling the bill as a tax cut.\nA number of other senators didn\u2019t think there was anything lawmakers could have done to sell the legislation more effectively.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s a messaging failure,\u201d Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) said Thursday. \u201cI just think that the information on the opposite side is so distorted and sensational that it skews the truth of the actual results of the bill.\u201d\nThe truth of the GOP tax plan has been hotly debated. Republicans started this discussion by insisting that their bill would be targeted to aid the middle class, that it wouldn\u2019t significantly help the wealthy, that it wouldn\u2019t add to the debt, that it would spur significant economic growth.\nAnalysis after analysis, however, has challenged those GOP claims. That in turn has caused Republicans to trash the analyses. The Tax Policy Center, for instance, said 47 percent of the benefits of the House\u2019s tax bill would go toward the richest 1 percent, so Republicans painted the nonpartisan center as liberal and said it couldn\u2019t \u201ccompute straight.\u201d When a Joint Committee on Taxation report\u00a0came out Thursday calculating that, even in a dynamic score accounting for increased growth effects, the Senate bill would still add more than a trillion dollars to the debt, Republicans just ignored it. Same with the committee\u2019s lackluster growth expectations.\nBut Republicans aren\u2019t questioning any of their own assumptions about their tax bill. They\u2019re just pressing on,\u00a0apparently convinced that the opposition is either fake news or simply wrong.\nWhen HuffPost asked Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) about the bill\u2019s unpopularity, he said it was practically impossible to sell tax cuts before they\u2019re passed. \u201cTax cuts are generally unpopular,\u201d he said \u2015 a claim that is historically inaccurate.\nTillis told a story about passing tax cuts in North Carolina when he was speaker of the statehouse. A colleague came up to him before the vote and cited some polls showing opposition to the state GOP\u2019s proposal. Tillis told his colleague that Republicans were going to get crushed in the press until they produced a result.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t produce a result until we vote,\u201d Tillis said. \u201cAnd when we vote, I think that the result \u2015 I\u2019m telling you, at the end of the day, if you go back in history, up to and including 1986, and think people were out parading with pep rallies saying, \u2018Go and pass that bill\u2019? Go back and do your history.\u201d\n(While the 1986 tax reform wasn\u2019t overwhelmingly popular, it did have a positive approval rating at the time: 38 percent to 34 percent.)\nStill, Tillis said it\u2019s much harder to build support for GOP proposals today with opponents using tools like Facebook and Twitter, and he suggested he had no qualms about passing a bill that a plurality of Americans oppose.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a function of the messaging space that we\u2019re in,\u201d he said.", "date": "\n11/30/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/senate-republicans-tax-bill-unpopular_n_5a20968de4b03350e0b58941", "tags": "tax unpopular gop republicans \u201d poll \u2015 senate bill care"}
