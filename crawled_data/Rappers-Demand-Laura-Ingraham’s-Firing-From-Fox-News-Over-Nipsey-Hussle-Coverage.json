Hussle\u2019s name was a play on the late comedian Russell\u2019s name.\nR&B singer Tank was among the first to speak out on Instagram, pushing for the host\u2019s removal.\n\u201cDisrespecting the deceased is not news,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s just disrespect!\u201d\nThe Game joined in just hours later with a post of his own, claiming that if the network doesn\u2019t take action, it \u201cwill lose millions of viewers one person at a time until it drastically effects your ratings, views etc.\u201d\n\u201cWe are NO LONGER laying quiet while you continuously disrespect our brother, culture African Americans as a whole,\u201d he added. \u201cI will use my platform & call on my peers to do the same.\u201d\nT.I.\u00a0reposted The Game\u2019s video shortly after, rebuking Ingraham\u2019s segment as \u201cdisgusting.\u201d\nTheir messages of opposition were also echoed by Snoop Dogg, who commented on The Game\u2019s post with a supportive, \u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d\nAn online petition for the firing has also circulated, garnering more than 17,000 signatures.\nFox News did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nHussle, born Ermias Asghedom, was shot and killed last month near his Marathon Clothing store in South Los Angeles.\nFollowing his death, many public figures,\u00a0including former President Barack Obama, have honored his music and his record of community activism to revitalize the South Los Angeles neighborhood where he grew up.\n\u00a0\nCorrection: A previous version of this article called Tank a rapper. He is an R&B singer.", "date": "\n04/15/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/rappers-demand-fox-news-fire-laura-ingraham_n_5cb4d1c7e4b0ffefe3b4f5be", "tags": "firing hussle fox game news nipsey coverage host laura \u201d demand funeral ingraham rappers"}
