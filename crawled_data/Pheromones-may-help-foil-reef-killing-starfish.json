{"title": "Pheromones may help foil reef-killing starfish", "content": "A starfish considered a key threat to international coral reefs could be thwarted by harnessing its own pheromones, scientists say.\nThe crown-of-thorns starfish has ravaged Australia's Great Barrier Reef by smothering and eating coral tissue.\nResearchers believe the pest could be lured for removal by fabricating the chemicals it uses to attract a mate.\nThe study unmasks how the species congregates in huge swarms, the Australian and Japanese team said.\nThe research, published in the journal Nature, studied the genomes of starfish gathered from the two nations.\nIt decoded the pheromones responsible for drawing starfish together so they could reproduce, said lead researcher Prof Bernard Degnan.\n\"We were able to use that approach to understand the chemistry that the starfish use to communicate with each other,\" he told the BBC.\n\"The next step is to use that information to fabricate bait based on these protein sequences.\"\nHe said the bait could \"trick\" the species into forming clusters, allowing them to be removed.\nHe suggested commercial fishers could even use the technique, perhaps for a bounty.\n\"Coral bleaching has taken a lot of limelight over the last year, but crown-of-thorns cause as much destruction,\" said Prof Degnan, a marine and molecular biologist.\nThe study included researchers from the University of Queensland, the Australian Institute of Marine Science, the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology and the University of the Sunshine Coast.\nIt follows other attempts to control the species, including the use of divers, robots and sea snails.", "date": "6 April 2017", "href": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-39510686", "tags": "study may species starfish coral pheromones help could crown-of-thorns researchers use reef-killing foil"}
