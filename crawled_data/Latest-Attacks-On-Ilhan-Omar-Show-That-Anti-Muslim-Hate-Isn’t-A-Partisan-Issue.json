{"title": "Latest Attacks On Ilhan Omar Show That Anti-Muslim Hate Isn\u2019t A Partisan Issue", "content": "President Donald Trump used Twitter to target Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) on Friday for remarks she made during a speech on Muslim civil rights last month.\nTrump tweeted an incendiary video that took clips from the speech out of context and interlaced them with news footage of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The tweet text accompanying the video read, \u201cWE WILL NEVER FORGET.\u201d\nThe video came a day after the New York Post published an ethically questionable and widely criticized cover featuring a quote by Omar across an image of the twin towers as they burned. \nThis week\u2019s attacks are the latest example of unchecked Islamophobia faced by Omar \u2015\u00a0as well as the impossible standards Muslim-American politicians are held to and the little nuance granted to them.\u00a0Ever since she was sworn in earlier this year, Omar, the first hijab-wearing\u00a0black Muslim congresswoman, has endured an onslaught of bad-faith attacks from the GOP and its allies. \u00a0\nIn addition, her Democratic colleagues have mostly been tepid in their support. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) reacted to Trump\u2019s tweet with a lukewarm response that didn\u2019t acknowledge Omar\u2019s name.\n\u201cThe memory of 9/11 is sacred ground, and any discussion of it must be done with reverence,\u201d Pelosi tweeted. \u201cThe President shouldn\u2019t use the painful images of 9/11 for a political attack.\u201d\nWhile the GOP and right-wing media continue to target Omar, America has watched the congresswoman navigate her new position with little support from her own party. Indeed,\u00a0most Democratic congressional leaders have been eerily silent, helping normalize Islamophobia from the highest levels of government.\nJust last month, politicians from both sides of the aisle accused Omar of anti-Semitism in response to comments she made about the pro-Israel lobby \u2015 which many advocates have argued were misinterpreted in bad faith. Top Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader\u00a0Chuck Schumer, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler and many others have all sharply criticized\u00a0their colleague for her statements.\nThe offices of those Democratic leaders did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment about Trump\u2019s tweet. Omar\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment either.\nA spokesperson for Pelosi told HuffPost on Friday that the speaker \u201cleft a message for Rep. Omar to discuss,\u201d but wouldn\u2019t comment further.\nThe timing of the attacks come as the Trump administration is gearing up for his 2020 reelection campaign, and as it continues to downplay the growing threat of white supremacy and hate crimes in the U.S. \nA hearing last week on the subject was derailed by conservatives questioning whether white supremacy exists at all. \nAmid all this, some Democrats have bucked the norm and stood up for their freshman colleague. Chief among them are Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), who was sworn in alongside Omar and is also one of the first Muslim women in Congress, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), another freshman.\n\u201cEnough is enough,\u201d Tlaib tweeted. \u201cNo more silence, with NY Post and now Trump taking Ilhan\u2019s words out of context to incite violence toward her, it\u2019s time for more Dems to speak up. Clearly the GOP is fine with this shameful stunt, but we cannot stand by.\u201d\nOcasio-Cortez tweeted that \u201cmembers of Congress have a duty to respond to the President\u2019s explicit attack today.\u201d\n\u201cIlhan Omar\u2019s life is in danger,\u201d she wrote. \u201cFor our colleagues to be silent is to be complicit in the outright, dangerous targeting of a member of Congress. We must speak out.\u201d\nOther prominent Democrats soon followed, with 2020 candidates Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Jay Inslee,\u00a0Beto O\u2019Rourke, Pete Buttigieg,\u00a0Juli\u00e1n Castro\u00a0and Jay Inslee also tweeting in support of Omar. HuffPost also reached out to a number of lawmakers who condemned Omar in the past, including Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Rep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), but not receive comment as of publication.\nThe Democratic Party has been struggling for a number of years with its own messaging when it comes to Islamophobia, and how it speaks on behalf of targeted Muslims, said Todd Green, the author of the book \u201cPresumed Guilty: Why We Shouldn\u2019t Ask Muslims to Condemn Terrorism.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\nThe bad-faith attacks against Omar, coupled with the lack of support from her colleagues, are predicated on the notion that Omar is already presumed guilty, Green told HuffPost. She isn\u2019t afforded the presumption that she would find the 9/11 attacks just as abhorrent as anyone else \u2015 all because she\u2019s Muslim.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the luxury most Muslims get,\u201d Green said. For Omar especially, she has become a target, a symbolic stand-in, in many ways, for ongoing anxieties politicized by the GOP. \nWhen Omar gave her speech last month, at an event in Los Angeles hosted by the Council on American-Islamic Relations, she referenced American Muslims\u2019 right to speak out about the Islamophobia they face in their daily lives. Muslims, she said, have \u201clived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen, and frankly I\u2019m tired of it, and every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it.\u201d \nThe only reason the speech became a focus of attack was because a controversial Australian imam took a clip from the speech and posted it to Twitter on Monday. The next day, Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) shared the imam\u2019s tweet in a tweet of his own, which has so far been retweeted over 28,000 times. On Wednesday, \u201cFox & Friends\u201d seized on Crenshaw\u2019s tweet and co-host Brian Kilmeade questioned if Omar \u201cwas American first.\u201d The New York Post followed the segment with its 9/11 cover on Thursday. The cycle concluded Friday with Trump\u2019s incendiary tweet. \nIt took just five days for an out-of-context clip taken from Omar\u2019s speech to go from a notorious imam in Australia to an incitement posted by the president of the United States, highlighting the power of social media, the right-wing media and the far-reaching influence of politicians.\nArsalan Bukhari, the strategic communications manager at CAIR, told HuffPost that the president\u2018s tweet is particularly alarming because it endangered the lives of Omar and her family. Just last week, a man was arrested and charged in New York with threatening to murder the congresswoman. \nMuslim civil rights leaders are calling for Democrats and Republicans to respond to these attacks and stipulate that Islamophobia is not a partisan issue. \u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen very few Democrats standing up,\u201d Bukhari told HuffPost. \u201cIt\u2019s time for more Democrats to stand up as well as Republicans to defend her and to tell those who are attacking her to cut it out.\u201d", "date": "\n04/13/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/latest-attacks-on-ilhan-omar-prove-that-anti-muslim-hate-isnt-a-partisan-issue_n_5cb1fb90e4b0ffefe3b10af3", "tags": "anti-muslim latest hate partisan speech issue show tweet democrats omar \u201d muslim ilhan huffpost attacks"}
