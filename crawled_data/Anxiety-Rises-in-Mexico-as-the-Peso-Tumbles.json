{"title": "Anxiety Rises in Mexico as the Peso Tumbles", "content": "MEXICO CITY \u2014 The voluble talk-show host Andrea Legarreta broke from her routine of celebrity chatter and household tips recently to give her television viewers an impromptu lesson in global economics and the Mexican peso.\n\u201cThe world economy has to do with what is going on with the Chinese economy, ob-vious-ly,\u201d Ms. Legarreta, the host of the popular morning program \u201cHoy,\u201d said, knowingly drawing out the last few syllables.\nWith growth slowing in China, she added, \u201cthis generates nervousness in the whole world.\u201d\nHer co-host, Ra\u00fal Araiza, chimed in: \u201cOne of the effects in Mexico is that the dollar costs just a bit more than it did.\u201d\nNever fear, Ms. Legaretta answered: \u201cJust because the dollar goes up, that doesn\u2019t mean the price of everything we buy goes up. Do you want to know why?\u201d\nThen she muddled through an explanation of exchange rates and cheaper exports, only to trail off with an admission that she was still confused. But in the end, Ms. Legaretta and Mr. Araiza agreed, Mexicans should not worry about the tumbling peso unless they hanker for expensive imports.\nTheir misplaced primer on international competitiveness invited ridicule on  social media. In response, Ms. Legarreta tried to deflect blame. In a letter posted on Twitter, and later removed, she wrote she had just said what \u201cthe advertisers want to share.\u201d\nBut her breathless introduction to economics did nothing to soothe Mexican consumers\u2019 worries: The peso has fallen more than 30 percent against the dollar over the past year, with an especially sharp drop this week.\nIn Mexico, where currency collapses have led to triple-digit inflation and deep recessions, the peso\u2019s tumble creates rising anxiety.\n\u201cFor many generations in Mexico, a weaker peso has generally been associated with a crisis,\u201d said Alonso Cervera, the managing director for Latin America economics at Credit Suisse. \u201cNot everyone understands that the causes are external.\u201d\nOne of those causes is the fall in oil prices, which saps market confidence in oil exporters like Mexico. The government here relies on oil revenues to finance part of the budget, and the price drop has already forced budget cuts. Last week the president of the central bank, Agust\u00edn Carstens, insisted that more cutbacks were needed to avoid \u201ca much longer and more painful adjustment process.\u201d\nStill, analysts say the economy is better protected than in the past. Public debt is manageable and the central bank sits on healthy foreign reserves. Unlike many of the emerging market economies that have also watched their currencies struggle against the dollar, Mexico\u2019s economy grew a modest 2.5 percent last year, and is expected to grow again this year.\n\u201cThere are many forces at play and it is very difficult to disentangle them,\u201d said Gabriel Lozano, the chief Mexico economist for J.P. Morgan, who argues that the Mexican economy shows many signs of strength. \u201cYou have a lot of buffers.\u201d\nBut public jitters can cause consumers to delay purchases and investments, putting brakes on the economy. To stave that off, officials have struggled to find the right language to project calm.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fact that we\u2019re experiencing a moment of great uncertainty and volatility in the capital markets,\u201d Mexico\u2019s finance secretary, Luis Videgaray, said in a recent radio interview. \u201cIn the face of that, governments have to act like the Mexican government has been doing, with full responsibility, with early measures to protect economic stability and that way protect the most important thing \u2014 which is to protect the economy of Mexican families.\u201d\nThe greatest worry is that a weaker peso will generate inflation as higher import prices are passed on to consumers. \nThe Mexican economy\u2019s link to the United States is among the strongest in the world, with almost $1.5 billion  in trade crossing back and forth across the border every day.\nThat means wherever one looks here, the effect of higher-priced American products is creeping in.\n\u201cThe price of apples went up from one day to the next,\u201d said Moi Gregorio, 33, the manager of a juice stand in Mexico City who blends apples from Washington State with other fruits grown in Mexico into his fresh juices. \u201cIf the price of the dollar stays like this, I won\u2019t have any choice but to raise the price.\u201d\nFor now, merchants are swallowing the cost increases. \u201cThe price of chicken has been going up every day since September,\u201d said Edgar Hern\u00e1ndez, 35, manager at a market counter that sells fresh poultry.\nPerhaps the Mexican-raised chickens eat imported animal feed, he speculated. Whatever the reason, \u201cI can\u2019t raise my price to the customer.\u201d\nThe price of cotton imported from the United States is a problem for LeRoy Laboratories, a national company that makes bandages and other medical supplies, said Armando Lezama Laguerenne, 48, who works in sales and training for the company.\nRather than pass on the full price increase to consumers, the company is trying to reduce costs and raise productivity, even if that means cutting some jobs, he said.\nFor now, Mexico\u2019s inflation rate is stable, well below the central bank\u2019s 3 percent target.\nAnd a cheaper currency is a blessing to some parts of the economy, like tourism. Other services are prospering, too.\n\u201cI have been drawing up budgets for foreigners nonstop\u201d since the fall, said Carlos Llergo, a producer for Arre Lul\u00fa, which provides production services for companies that shoot advertisements in Mexico.\n\u201cEven when the peso wasn\u2019t so cheap, they came for the locations or the well-qualified technicians,\u201d Mr. Llergo said. \u201cNow that it\u2019s cheaper and they make more money, they are in heaven.\u201d\nAvelino Rodr\u00edguez, managing partner for The Lift, another production services company, said that the cost of shooting a Corona beer ad recently was 10 percent under budget because of the peso\u2019s fall.\nBut a cheap peso on its own is not enough to assure business, he said. Spain, Portugal, South Africa, Argentina and Brazil are all competitors \u2014 and their currencies have fallen, too.\nOne of Mexico\u2019s most successful industries faces a similar challenge.\n\u201cYes, we are more competitive, but so are all the emerging markets that make auto parts,\u201d said Oscar Albin, the executive president of the National Autoparts Industry.\nMexican factories sold some $85 billion in parts last year. \u201cIf we all have the same advantage, then it stops being an advantage,\u201d he said.\nOn top of that, many components, like steel, plastic and fabric for seats, are priced in dollars.\nIt is not just pricing that has given Mexico an edge, Mr. Albin said, \u201cIt\u2019s the productivity that makes us competitive.\u201d", "date": "Feb. 12, 2016", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/13/world/americas/anxiety-rises-in-mexico-as-the-peso-tumbles.html", "tags": "peso rises \u201d one economy price anxiety mexico mexican tumbles dollar"}
