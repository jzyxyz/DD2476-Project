Toronto airport has also experienced delays and cancellations.\nThe freezing weather comes in the wake of a powerful winter storm that dumped snow as far south as Florida.\nMeanwhile in Sydney, extreme heat cut power to thousands of people, and charities were handing out water to the homeless.\nPlay at an international tennis tournament in Sydney had to be postponed when temperatures rose above 40C, while cricketers from England and Australia playing at Sydney Cricket Ground endured the hottest day recorded during a Test match in Australia.  \nWildfire warnings are in place for the Sydney area.
