{"title": "Toys, Phones and Sneakers: The Chinese Goods Trump Wants to Tax Next ", "content": "The Trump administration can't shield consumers from its trade war anymore.\nUntil now, President Trump\u2019s tariffs on a total of $250 billion in Chinese imports have largely hit intermediate and capital goods \u2014 items typically bought by businesses, not shoppers. \nThat will change if Mr. Trump follows through with his threat to tax nearly every product China sends to the United States, or roughly $300 billion worth of goods. The United States trade representative on Monday detailed a list of what would face a tax of as much as 25 percent, which includes nearly 4,000 product categories.\nMr. Trump said on Monday he had not yet decided whether to impose the tariffs, but his administration has begun the formal process necessary for the United States to make good on his threat.\nOfficials said that the new batch of tariffs \u201ccovers essentially all products not currently covered\u201d by Mr. Trump\u2019s existing tariffs on Chinese imports, but that the list \u201cexcludes pharmaceuticals, certain pharmaceutical inputs, select medical goods, rare earth materials, and critical minerals.\u201d\nSo what would get hit with tariffs? The list reads like a shopping list for Target or Walmart, including toys, shoes, coffee makers and watches. Smartphones, photocopiers and video game consoles will face a tax. Also included are guns, fireworks, backgammon, Christmas decorations, practical joke toys, furs (with or without paws) and merry-go-rounds. \nThe list includes nearly 40 Chinese import categories that Americans collectively spent $1 billion or more on in 2017, according to government statistics. The largest among those, at $44.5 billion, are cellphones, followed by laptops at $37.2 billion and toys at $12.2 billion.\nHere\u2019s a quick scan of other consumer favorites that will be subject to tariffs if Mr. Trump follows through:\nMr. Trump has insisted that the tariffs will not raise prices for consumers, saying that China will bear the brunt of the taxes, a view that many economists dispute. \nOn Monday, Mr. Trump encouraged companies to avoid tariffs by moving production out of China and into the United States or a country like Vietnam. He said the next round of tariffs represented \u201ca tremendous amount of money that would come into our country.\"\nShifting production across borders would be difficult for some consumer-facing companies to do quickly, said Alan Detmeister, an economist at UBS and former head of the price and wage section at the Federal Reserve.\nThat means consumers could have little choice but to pay more for those goods, or buy fewer of them. It\u2019s likely that the result will be higher consumer inflation. Goldman Sachs economists expect 25 percent tariffs on remaining Chinese goods could push up inflation \u2014 now at 1.6 percent on a core basis \u2014 by half a percentage point.", "date": "May 13, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/13/business/toys-phones-and-sneakers-the-chinese-goods-trump-wants-to-tax-next.html", "tags": "next goods tax sneakers toys billion united states wants phones trump chinese tariffs list"}
