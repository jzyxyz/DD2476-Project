{"title": "The QAnon Conspiracy Has Stumbled Into Real Life, And It\u2019s Not Going To End Well", "content": "On June 15, when he packed his AR-15 and drove an armored vehicle onto the bridge near Hoover Dam, Matthew Wright had a mission.\u00a0He\u2019d gleaned it from a berserk conspiracy theory that circulates mainly online, and now here he was, offline,\u00a0near a very real dam, with a not-at-all-virtual rifle.\nAs he blocked traffic, he held up a sign. \u201cRelease the OIG report,\u201d it read. He wanted the same thing that so many others that subscribe to the all-encompassing QAnon conspiracy theory want: some sort of proof of a \u201cdeep state\u201d conspiracy, run by the liberal elite and Hollywood, to commit and then cover up an array of atrocities, from child sex trafficking to false-flag shootings. And they thought they would find at least some damning evidence in the Department of Justice\u2019s inspector general report on the FBI\u2019s handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation.\nThe report he was looking for had actually been released the day before, and it didn\u2019t have any of the information he and the rest of\u00a0the QAnon followers\u00a0sought. Of course, the theory\u2019s adherents believe there\u2019s another\u00a0inspector general\u2019s report they haven\u2019t seen, one with all the \u201ctrue\u201d information, and they\u2019ll fight to get it.\nOn the day he was arrested in Arizona on a variety of federal charges, Wright was acting as a soldier for \u201cQ.\u201d That\u2019s the handle of an anonymous poster on equally anonymous message boards 4chan and 8chan and on Reddit since late last year. In letters Wright wrote from jail, intended for President Donald Trump and various government offices, he signed off with the QAnon motto: \u201cFor where we go one, we go all.\u201d\u00a0He also referred to a \u201cGreat Awakening,\u201d another likely allusion to QAnon.\nNobody was harmed in the bridge standoff. But Wright\u2019s crusade, along with a handful of other recent incidents, gives us an idea of what QAnon looks like when it emerges from its online cave, blinking in the sun. And it\u2019s a little terrifying.\nAs conspiracies go, QAnon isn\u2019t even faintly plausible. It\u2019s every conspiracy, all at once, an orchestra tune-up of theories. It involves Hollywood, former presidents and the Democratic Party joining up to commit various heinous crimes. And on the other side is an anonymous hero named Q, who claims to have high-level government clearance.\nA surface-level glance at QAnon threads on Reddit, 4chan and 8chan will make you cringe well before it\u2019ll scare you. In one post, commenters wondered whether Q was winking at them\u00a0by making the lights flicker during President Trump\u2019s White House speech last week. The post reads in earnest: \u201cWhat if the lights going out during the press conference was... the cue(Q)?\u201d\u00a0\nIn another, a Redditor used one of Q\u2019s posts to surmise that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton\u2019s entire family fabricated the Parkland, Florida, school massacre to \u201cadvance the anti-2nd agenda.\u201d Commenters agreed and expressed their anger with all the maturity and expertise of a high school film studies class.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just like watching V for Vendetta in how the people would trade away their freedom for security,\u201d one commenter wrote.\n\u201cThe more I\u2019m reading about the Q posts, the more it brings me back to that movie,\u201d said another. \u201cFalse flags, under-age exploitation, and a top level conspiracy even among a major religion.\u201d\nThere are hundreds of these posts. Choose any conspiracy you like \u2015\u00a0false-flag shootings, underground child sex dungeons run by elite predators, unreleased Justice Department reports that, if made public, would put Hillary Clinton in jail \u2015 and you\u2019ll find them being discussed on QAnon forums.\nThe Daily Beast\u2019s Will Sommer wrote a great primer\u00a0on the theory.\u00a0It essentially goes like this: \u201cQ\u201d started posting weird messages on 4chan last November, leaving \u201cbreadcrumbs\u201d for the online masses to find evidence that several top Democrats are about to be sent to Guantanamo Bay, special counsel Robert Mueller is actually investigating Hillary Clinton, etc. Nobody knows who \u201cQ\u201d actually is, and there\u2019s no evidence that the person (or persons) posting under that handle has (or have) any high-level security clearance.\nIt\u2019s easy to roll your eyes at the QAnon conspiracy theory, in much the same way it was easy to dismiss Pizzagaters as a bunch of lunatics\u00a0\u2014 right up until the moment one of them, Edgar Welch, showed up in Comet Ping Pong pizza parlor in Washington, demanded to know where the child sex dungeon was and fired an assault rifle.\u00a0\u00a0\nThus ended Pizzagate,\u00a0the real-world violence shattering the suspension of disbelief that had sustained the theory online. Even after Wright\u2019s arrest in Arizona, QAnon has continued apace, undeterred by the fact that the \u201cOIG report\u201d\u00a0he demanded had already been released, to the\u00a0great disappointment\u00a0of Q\u2019s followers.\nQAnon adherents are on a collective scavenger hunt of sorts \u2015 the goal varies from unearthing conspiracies between politicians and Hollywood brass to finding a group of elite pedophiles in the desert. In Tucson,\u00a0a group called Veterans on Patrol, with the backing of QAnon online, is hunting for pedophiles after it stumbled on a homeless shelter in May and decided it was a secret site for child sex trafficking. As Motherboard reports, it is not \u2015 police found no evidence of such trafficking \u2015 but the group is patrolling Interstate 19 in Arizona and demands that police declare a state of emergency. It also posted the QAnon 8chan thread to its Facebook page, asking for the internet\u2019s help in finding the elusive, and nonexistent, pedophiles. A QAnon Reddit post says it is \u201cprepping for battle.\u201d\nOf course, another real-life QAnon mission brings another arrest. The founder of Veterans on Patrol,\u00a0Michael Lewis Arthur Meyer, was collared on Sunday after sheriff\u2019s deputies saw a YouTube video in which he was rifling through private property in his hunt for nonexistent pedophiles.\u00a0He was arrested on suspicion of trespassing,\u00a0along with a charge of failure to appear in court on July 17 for an unrelated assault charge.\u00a0\nMeyer is the perfect QAnon soldier \u2015\u00a0committed enough to put his boots on and go LARPing through the desert, unhinged enough to believe that a homeless camp he finds is a child sex-trafficking dungeon and savvy enough to disseminate his findings online to likeminded people. He is too extreme even for some extremists.\u00a0Meyer and his group were kicked out of the occupation party at a federal building in Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in 2016 after militants accused him of walking in and assaulting a disabled Vietnam veteran.\n\u201cI do believe Lewis [Meyer] is a Paid Provocateur by the Fed\u2019s to divide and destroy,\u201d militant group member Blaine Cooper wrote in a Facebook post at the time. Writer J.J. MacNab points out that Meyer was also tossed off of Cliven Bundy\u2019s ranch in Nevada during the standoff over defaulted grazing fees there.\nAs the Arizona Daily Star reports,\u00a0Meyer has accused any number of businesses of child sex-trafficking \u2015 various farms and ranches,\u00a0a building materials company, a mining company, etc. \u2015 their only crime being that they\u2019re in relative proximity to Agua Blanca Ranch, where he uncovered what he thought was a den of illicit activity involving kids.\n\u201cWhat jumped out at me was their ignorance of what things really were. The cooling towers that they were calling watchtowers. Maps being on the wall, which they called a command center. Children\u2019s rooms \u2014 that it was something we had created to hold children in. It just seemed ridiculous,\u201d David Cathcart, caretaker of the ranch, told the Daily Star. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a hell of a lot better imagination than I do.\u201d\nFor QAnon, wild imaginations drive the bus. And some of those imaginations are the loudest people on the internet.\nReliable loons Roseanne Barr, former Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling and Minecraft creator (and Pizzagate supporter) Markus \u201cNotch\u201d Persson have all signed on. Barr and Persson, for instance, tweeted out abbreviations of the QAnon slogan, \u201cWhere we go one, we go all,\u201d to millions of followers. And, of course, Infowars\u2019 resident nut Alex Jones is involved \u2015 he\u00a0said in January that the White House called on him and his team of dinguses to investigate QAnon.\nThere are so many conspiracy theories under the QAnon umbrella now that anything and everything can feel like a dog whistle to its followers. Recently, followers latched on to Hollywood director James Gunn.\u00a0Gunn\u00a0was fired by Disney last week after alt-right troll Mike Cernovich helped surface old tweets in which he joked about pedophilia and rape.\u00a0Underlying the fake-outrage campaign was the QAnon-friendly notion that Hollywood is lousy with pedophiles. Even Sen. Ted Cruz got in on the fun.\u00a0\n\u201cQ\u201d hasn\u2019t posted anything since July 4, leaving those followers frantic for something to do. If the unhinged LARPing of Wright and Meyer is any indication,\u00a0that something could easily tip over into violence.\u00a0\nUPDATE: 12:15 p.m. \u2014\u00a0\u201cQ\u201d\u00a0has returned:", "date": "\n07/24/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/qanon-conspiracy-real-life_n_5b54bbafe4b0b15aba8fe484", "tags": "q going well end stumbled \u201d one real \u2015 qanon theory life meyer conspiracy wright"}
