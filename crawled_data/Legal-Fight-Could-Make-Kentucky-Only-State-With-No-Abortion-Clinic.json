{"title": "Legal Fight Could Make Kentucky Only State With No Abortion Clinic", "content": "LOUISVILLE, Ky. \u2014 As states across the nation enact increasingly aggressive restrictions on abortion, perhaps nowhere has the political climate shifted as much as here in Kentucky, where the E.M.W. Women\u2019s Surgical Center, a squat tan brick building on Market Street, is the state\u2019s sole abortion clinic.\nOver the past year, Gov. Matt Bevin, a Republican who calls himself \u201cunapologetically pro-life,\u201d has blocked a new Planned Parenthood clinic from performing abortions, shuttered E.M.W.\u2019s satellite clinic in Lexington and threatened to close the existing one in Louisville. Backed by the American Civil Liberties Union, the clinic has sued the state; a trial is set for September.\nThe governor\u2019s forceful moves have rattled reproductive rights advocates, made him a hero among abortion opponents and prompted both sides in the debate to ask a question: Could Kentucky become America\u2019s only state to lack a single abortion clinic?\n\u201cKentucky literally stands on the verge of making redemptive history,\u201d said the Rev. Rusty Thomas, director of Operation Save America, a Dallas-based anti-abortion group that will host its annual national meeting in Louisville in July. \u201cIt could be the first surgically abortion-free state in the United States of America.\u201d\nDr. Ernest Marshall, 66, who founded E.M.W. in 1981 and has performed abortions here for 37 years, portrayed the situation from his perspective this way: \u201cWe are under assault.\u201d\nAcross the country, the number of abortion providers has been steadily dropping for decades, partly because of better access to birth control \u2014 which means fewer unplanned pregnancies, and thus fewer abortions \u2014 but also because of restrictions that make it difficult for clinics to stay open.\nKentucky, which had 17 abortion providers in 1978, is today among seven states \u2014 the others are North Dakota, South Dakota, Missouri, Mississippi, Wyoming and West Virginia \u2014 with just one.\nMr. Bevin\u2019s election in 2015 was only the beginning of the shift in the abortion landscape here. Republicans, riding Donald J. Trump\u2019s coattails, took control of the Kentucky House in November for the first time in 95 years. Their first order of business in January was to pass two measures restricting abortion \u2014 one banning the procedure after 20 weeks into a pregnancy, and the other requiring doctors to narrate ultrasounds in detail, regardless of patients\u2019 wishes.\nThe A.C.L.U. is also challenging the ultrasound measure, on the grounds that it violates doctors\u2019 First Amendment rights. In signing it, Mr. Bevin vowed to \u201cend this scourge that is the taking of innocent life,\u201d adding, \u201cKentucky will lead the way.\u201d\nFor Elizabeth Nash, who tracks state abortion legislation for the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit research organization, Kentucky\u2019s turnabout is striking. \u201cKentucky for a long time was not on the policy radar,\u201d Ms. Nash said. \u201cNow Kentucky is following the model of Texas and Ohio, where they are adopting restrictions or making it very difficult to keep clinic doors open.\u201d\nAt 7:30 in the morning, every Tuesday through Saturday, Kentucky\u2019s intensifying battle over abortion plays out in downtown Louisville, along the sidewalk in front of the E.M.W. clinic.\nThe clinic\u2019s mirrored doors are guarded by a volunteer corps of orange-vested escorts, who station themselves strategically at street corners so they can usher patients to the center from nearby parking lots, past a phalanx of protesters.\nMen in ball caps finger rosary beads and recite the Lord\u2019s Prayer. Some hold grisly signs depicting bloody fetuses or shout religious messages through megaphones. On a recent weekday morning, a young woman arrived, accompanied by her grandmother and carrying a toddler in her arms.\n\u201cYou\u2019re bringing a baby into an abortion clinic!\u201d a man shouted, as escorts hustled them inside. \u201cWhere they\u2019re going to murder the other baby!\u201d\nInside the clinic, soothing music played. Eleven patients were scheduled that day, roughly half for \u201cmedical abortions\u201d in which pills are used to induce miscarriage. One by one, they visited with the clinic\u2019s director and counselor, Anne Ahola, who joined the center 17 years ago after working with abused children.\nKentucky law requires that women receive counseling, either in person or by video, at least 24 hours before an abortion. Their stories offered a glimpse into the varied reasons, and often painful decisions, involved in ending pregnancies \u2014 especially in a state like Kentucky, where, Dr. Marshall said, many of his colleagues in obstetrics and gynecology oppose abortion.\nOne 37-year-old woman tearfully confessed that she had had an affair with a co-worker, who was married: \u201cI\u2019m his boss, and this is strictly forbidden; we could both lose our jobs.\u201d She quietly asked for a copy of her ultrasound picture.\nAnother, 29, appeared nonchalant. \u201cI\u2019m working,\u201d she said flatly. \u201cIt\u2019s not in my plan right now.\u201d\nA third, 31 and a mother of two, said she was trying to escape an abusive relationship. \u201cIt\u2019s been a struggle for me,\u201d she told Ms. Ahola. \u201cI am a religious person, I\u2019ve been crying and battling with my beliefs, but I also think God understands.\u201d She said she worried that the clinic would close: \u201cWe need this option.\u201d\nMs. Ahola ended each talk with the same question: \u201cAre you sure this is the right decision for you, and did you reach this decision yourself?\u201d\nReproductive rights advocates say women in Kentucky, especially those in poor rural parts of the state, have long faced economic and geographic barriers to obtaining abortions. Many cannot afford to travel or to pay for the procedure. And as surrounding states have enacted restrictions, their options are narrowing.\n\u201cWe used to have people who lived in Bowling Green; the Nashville clinic was closer than Louisville,\u201d said Patricia Canon, who volunteers with the Kentucky Health Justice Network, a nonprofit that helps women pay for abortions and transports them to clinics. \u201cBut then Tennessee decided to enact a 48-hour, in-person waiting period. That means two trips, two days.\u201d\nYet until recently, advocates hoped abortion services would expand in Kentucky.\nWhen Mr. Bevin\u2019s Democratic predecessor, Gov. Steve Beshear, was in office, Planned Parenthood built a new health care center in Louisville. After Mr. Bevin became governor, the center briefly offered abortions, following standard state procedures to obtain a license, said Tamarra Wieder, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood here.\nThe Bevin administration promptly sued, claiming the center was performing abortions illegally. A judge dismissed the case, but the state appealed. So while the Planned Parenthood center is open and offers an array of reproductive health services, it is obeying the state\u2019s \u201ccease and desist\u201d order not to perform abortions.\n\u201cFor a state as big as Kentucky, one abortion provider is not enough,\u201d Ms. Wieder said.\nDr. Marshall\u2019s conflict with the state began about a year ago, when state inspectors showed up at his Lexington clinic, which he says operated as a physician\u2019s office and thus did not require a license. The state insisted it did.\nA legal battle ensued, but as the case dragged on, E.M.W. in Lexington could not afford to stay open without seeing patients, and its landlord refused to renew its lease, said Dona Wells, the former clinic administrator. It closed in January.\nThe Kentucky National Organization for Women declared the clinic \u201ca permanent casualty\u201d of the governor, while abortion opponents, long beleaguered under Governor Beshear, cheered.\n\u201cKentucky is a very pro-life state,\u201d said Mike Janocik, assistant director of the Kentucky to Right Life Association. \u201cAbortion providers tend to fly under the radar, especially when they are in administrations favorable to their position, as ours has been for a long time in Kentucky.\u201d\nThe dispute in Louisville revolves around the state\u2019s assertion that E.M.W. lacks adequate \u201ctransfer agreements\u201d with hospitals and ambulance services to get women help in case of medical emergency. Amanda Stamper, a spokeswoman for Mr. Bevin, said the governor was \u201cworking diligently to protect the health, welfare and lives of women in Kentucky.\u201d\nBut Donald Cox, a lawyer for the Louisville clinic, said the state\u2019s complaint was rooted in a technicality: A Catholic health care organization, part owner of the nearby University of Louisville Hospital, will not sign the center\u2019s longstanding agreements because of religious objections to abortion.\nLast month, the state threatened to close E.M.W. within 10 days; Judge Greg N. Stivers of United States District Court here issued an emergency order blocking the closing, writing that the clinic had \u201ca strong likelihood of success.\u201d\nThe case will be an early test of how federal courts interpret a 2016 Supreme Court ruling, in which the justices struck down parts of a Texas law that imposed similar requirements to Kentucky\u2019s, saying they posed an \u201cundue burden\u201d on women, said Brigitte Amiri, a lawyer with the A.C.L.U.\u2019s Reproductive Freedom Project, which also represents the clinic.\n\u201cThe burden on women in Kentucky if E.M.W. closed down would be extreme,\u201d Ms. Amiri said. \u201cThere would be an effective ban on abortion.\u201d", "date": "May 2, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/us/kentucky-abortion-clinic.html", "tags": "abortions kentucky make legal clinic \u201d abortion state could women fight louisville"}
