The statement I made on Saturday, the first statement, was a fine statement, but you don\u2019t make statements that direct unless you know the facts,\u201d Trump argued. \u201cIt takes a little while to get the facts. You still don\u2019t know the facts. It is a very, very important process to me. It is a very important statement. So I don\u2019t want to go quickly and just make a statement for the sake of making a political statement. I want to know the facts.\u201d\nTrump stayed silent until Saturday afternoon on the situation in Charlottesville, which began heating up with white supremacist marches Friday night. His response \u2015 which followed that of his wife,\u00a0Melania, the first from the White House to comment on the protests \u2015 was a rebuke of hatred\u00a0\u201con many sides.\u201d\n\u201cWe condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides \u2015 on many sides,\u201d Trump said at a ceremony for the signing of a bill to reform the Veterans Affairs health care system. \u201cIt\u2019s been going on for a long time in our country, not Donald Trump, not Barack Obama. It\u2019s been going on for a long, long time.\u201d\nTrump said Tuesday his initial remarks were described as\u00a0\u201cbeautiful.\u201d However,\u00a0he was widely panned for failing to call out hate groups, prompting even some Republican lawmakers to criticize his remarks.\nOn Monday \u2015 three days after the events in Charlottesville began and two days after a car driven by a white supremacist plowed into a group of counterprotesters and killed\u00a0a woman\u00a0\u2015 Trump finally condemned hate groups in a press conference where he appeared rigid, carefully reading his statement from a teleprompter.\nBut on Tuesday, Trump issued his strongest statement yet, pointing blame at groups who showed up to demonstrate against the white supremacists who organized in Charlottesville to protest the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee, a Confederate general.\n\u201cWhat about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, \u2018alt-right\u2019? Do they have any semblance of guilt?\u201d Trump asked reporters. \u201cWhat about the fact that they came charging with clubs in their hands, swinging clubs? Do they have any problem? I think they do.\u201d\nAccording to The New York Times\u2019 Maggie Haberman, reporters at Trump Tower were told Trump wouldn\u2019t be taking questions on Tuesday.\u00a0A White House official told CNN staffers\u00a0they had hoped Trump\u2019s remarks today would focus on infrastructure.\nDuring his remarks Tuesday, the president argued taking down Confederate statues, such as the Lee statue, could lead to the removal of statues of other historic figures, such as George Washington or Thomas Jefferson.\n\u201cYou really do have to ask yourself, where does it stop?\u201d Trump said.\nHe also defended those in his administration who have ties to white nationalism, including senior adviser Steve Bannon.\nEver the businessman, Trump also took the opportunity to plug his winery in Virginia before leaving the press conference, saying it\u2019s the reason he knows a lot about Charlottesville.\nThis story has been updated with more details about the presser and events in Charlottesville.", "date": "\n08/15/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-charlottesville-statement_n_59935477e4b009141640ab00", "tags": "people more- attended \u201c remarks white trump defends rally donald supremacist charlottesville -plus lot statement \u2015 tuesday whole"}
