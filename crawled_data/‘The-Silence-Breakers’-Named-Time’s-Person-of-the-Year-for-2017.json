{"title": "\u2018The Silence Breakers\u2019 Named Time\u2019s Person of the Year for 2017", "content": "First it was a story. Then a moment. Now, two months after women began to come forward in droves to accuse powerful men of sexual harassment and assault, it is a movement.\nTime magazine has named \u201cthe silence breakers\u201d its person of the year for 2017, referring to those women, and the global conversation they have started.\nThe magazine\u2019s editor in chief, Edward Felsenthal, said in an interview on the \u201cToday\u201d show on Wednesday that the #MeToo movement represented the \u201cfastest-moving social change we\u2019ve seen in decades, and it began with individual acts of courage by women and some men too.\u201d\nInvestigations published in October by The New York Times and The New Yorker, both of them detailing multiple allegations of sexual harassment and assault against the movie producer Harvey Weinstein, sparked the sudden rush of women coming forward.\nIn a joint interview after the choice was announced, Tarana Burke, who created the Me Too mantra years ago, and the actress Alyssa Milano, who helped promote it more recently, focused on what was still left to do.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been saying from the beginning that it\u2019s not just a moment, it\u2019s a movement,\u201d Ms. Burke said. \u201cI think now the work really begins. The hashtag is a declaration. But now we\u2019re poised to really stand up and do the work.\u201d\nMs. Milano agreed, laying out her aspirations for the movement.\n\u201cI want companies to take on a code of conduct, I want companies to hire more women, I want to teach our children better,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are all things that we have to set in motion, and as women we have to support each other and stand together and say that\u2019s it, we\u2019re done, no more.\u201d\nIt is a testament to the size of the movement that the set of \u201cToday\u201d itself, where the announcement was made, had recently been the site of such a reckoning. Matt Lauer, one of NBC\u2019s most well-known personalities for decades, was fired only last week after an allegation of sexual harassment from a subordinate. Other complaints soon followed.\nAnd of course, Time\u2019s 2017 runner-up for person of the year, Donald J. Trump, was accused during his presidential campaign by more than 10 women of sexual misconduct, from unwanted touching to sexual assault.\nThose accusations did not stop Mr. Trump from being named person of the year in 2016. And Mr. Trump inadvertently promoted this year\u2019s announcement, tweeting that he had been told he would \u201cprobably\u201d be chosen again and claiming to have turned down the honor. Time quickly released a statement saying that the president was incorrect.\nTime has been using the title for more than nine decades to drum up interest in one of its tentpole issues. The magazine chose its first group, as opposed to a single \u201cman of the year\u201d (and back then it was a man), in 1950, when it selected \u201cthe American Fighting-man.\u201d The title was changed to the neutral \u201cperson of the year\u201d in 1999.\nOther groups have included \u201cAmericans under 25\u201d in 1966, \u201cThe Whistleblowers\u201d in 2002 and, memorably, \u201cYou\u201d in 2006.\nIn 1975, the magazine chose \u201cAmerican women,\u201d profiling a dozen who it said \u201csymbolized the new consciousness of women generally.\u201d It would be a decade before Time selected another woman.", "date": "Dec. 6, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/business/media/silence-breakers-time-person-of-the-year.html", "tags": "breakers movement \u2018 magazine silence person \u201d year sexual women time named"}
