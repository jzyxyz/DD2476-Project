{"title": "Laura Ingraham Is Mainstreaming White Supremacy, But She's Not Alone", "content": "The Unite the Right rally in Washington last weekend was minuscule compared with the crowd of counterprotesters who showed up to meet them. A mere two dozen fans of the far-right showed up to face the hundreds who rallied for racial justice. While those numbers are on the side of what is good in this world, it would be a mistake to think that white supremacy has been defeated. In fact, it\u2019s not even in retreat.\nInstead, white supremacy is being mainstreamed, and media outlets \u2015 liberal and conservative \u2015 and tech platforms are helping. \nLet\u2019s start with the conservative media, where Fox News has been doing what Roger Ailes intended it to do when he launched it in 1996: driving the political discourse further and further to the right. \nOn her Fox News show last week, Laura Ingraham launched into a diatribe about \u201cmassive demographic changes have been foisted on the American people, and they are changes that none of us ever voted for, and most of us don\u2019t like ... this is related to both illegal and legal immigration.\u201d Ingraham\u2019s conclusion: \u201cThe America we know and love doesn\u2019t exist anymore.\u201d \nIngraham\u2019s anti-immigrant screed was so thoroughly consistent with the playbook of white supremacy that David Duke, the proponent of white nationalism and former Klansman, tweeted his support and called it \u201cone of the most important (truthful) monologues in the history of MSM.\u201d On the following night\u2019s show, Ingraham\u00a0disavowed Duke\u2019s response and insisted that her comments were \u201cnot about race or ethnicity.\u201d But as part of the wide campaign at Fox News to make the abhorrent more palatable, she has been pushing white supremacist talking points into the mainstream for years. \u00a0\nThe chief strategy for shifting the range of the acceptable ideas to discuss is known as moving the \u201cOverton window.\u201d\u00a0Committed white nationalists understand this strategy and consciously work to shift the national discourse to their ideological advantage. As a white nationalist\u00a0told a reporter\u00a0in 2016, \u201cin a sense, we\u2019ve managed to push white nationalism into a very mainstream position.\u201d\nBut it\u2019s not just conservative media and avowed white nationalists who are pulling previously fringe ideas toward the center.\u00a0\nNational Public Radio, widely regarded as left-leaning, but really\u00a0just barely a liberal radio network, has helped mainstream white supremacy, too. Last week Noel King, host of \u201cMorning Edition,\u201d\u00a0interviewed Jason Kessler, organizer of\u00a0 last year\u2019s deadly Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville,\u00a0Virginia, and this year\u2019s in D.C. King asked Kessler about his beliefs about different races of people, providing Kessler a platform to broadcast his white supremacist views uninterrupted \u2015 and unchecked \u2015 to a national audience. Some in that audience probably thought Kessler\u2019s unreconstructed racism sounded like a reasonable set of ideas. \u00a0\nOthers excoriated NPR for the interview. The network defended the interview. \u201cInterviewing the people in the news is part of NPR\u2019s mission to inform the American public, it does not mean NPR is endorsing one view over another,\u201d the network said in a statement. \u201cOur job is to present the facts and the voices that provide context on the day\u2019s events, not to protect our audience from views that might offend them.\u201d \nIn granting someone like Kessler an on-air interview because its \u201cjob is to present facts and voices,\u201d NPR is every bit as complicit in the mainstreaming of white supremacy as Fox News. It just uses a more modulated tone. And, in giving Kessler a platform to spout white supremacist talking points, NPR moves those ideas to the center of political discourse. This may be an unintended consequence. It is nonetheless consequential. Under the guise of \u201cboth sides\u201d journalism, NPR is helping to make white supremacist ideas mainstream.\nIn the last decade, social media platforms have joined broadcast media outlets in shifting the Overton window toward white supremacy. Since 2006, Twitter has speeded up the news cycle through the use of algorithms, and avowed white supremacists have seized on social media platforms as \u201cinnovation opportunists\u201d and used them for mainstreaming white supremacy. \nSome tech companies are finally taking action. Last week, Apple banned Alex Jones, a conspiracy theorist and Trump supporter who rants about the threat from \u201cglobalists,\u201d a white nationalist code word for \u201cJews.\u201d Several other tech companies, including Facebook, followed suit. But Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey refuses to ban Jones, explaining that Jones \u201chadn\u2019t violated any rules,\u201d and is part of the \u201chealthy conversational environment,\u201d Dorsey wants to cultivate on the platform. \nDorsey, like many other other tech bros, takes a \u201crace-less\u201d approach to running Twitter. The platform and all other tech tools, the thinking goes, was created and exists outside of the influence of racial bias, and the rules that govern that bias. Therefore, the platforms do not need to take race into account. Twitter is just a neutral tool, the reasoning goes. But many racists see this \u201crace-less\u201d approach as an opportunity to further situate white supremacy at the center of our political discourse. Jones, for instance, has used Dorsey\u2019s unwillingness to ban him as an opportunity to congratulate Dorsey for being an \u201cally against globalists.\u201d\nTo be sure, white supremacy has always been mainstream in the U.S., a country that began with the genocide of indigenous people and chattel slavery of African people. But something has shifted in the white backlash to the Obama presidency and in this post-Obama era. Indeed, the current mainstreaming of white supremacy is a realignment of our national story with the worst parts of its origins. \nIf we want to be something else, something better than that legacy, then we will have to learn to fight against white supremacy in all its guises, whether in the regalia of the far-right, the business attire of Fox News, the tech-fantasy of a race-less Internet or the dulcet tones of NPR.\n\u00a0\nJessie Daniels is a professor at the City University of New York and the author of the forthcoming book\u00a0Tweetstorm: The Rise of the \u201cAlt-Right\u201d and the Mainstreaming of White Nationalism.", "date": "\n08/15/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/opinion-laura-ingraham-fox-npr-twitter-white-supremacy-racism_n_5b731a29e4b0594c38c58ac4", "tags": "supremacy npr news media alone laura tech white \u201d last kessler mainstreaming ingraham"}
