{"title": "GOP Congressman Complains Women Are 'In My Grill' Over Obamacare Repeal", "content": "Rep. David Brat (R-Va.) is feeling pressure from women in his district over Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\u201cSince Obamacare and these issues have come up, the women are in my grill no matter where I go,\u201d Brat said to laughter at a private event on Saturday, according to a video posted to Facebook. \u201cThey come up and say, \u2018When\u2019s your next town hall?\u2019 And believe me, it\u2019s not to give positive input.\u201d\u00a0\nHe asked the audience to mobilize because \u201cwe\u2019re getting hammered.\u201d\nBrat made the comment while speaking about a Facebook effort that some of his constituents had organized to find out when the congressman plans to hold his next town hall. He told the Richmond Times-Dispatch\u00a0on Monday that the people behind the effort were \u201cpaid activists.\u201d\nBut Becky Shields, one of Brat\u2019s constituents, said that suggestion was \u201cludicrous.\u201d She and about 50 other people who live in Brat\u2019s district \u2015 most of whom are women and none of whom are being paid, Shields said \u2015 have begun organizing after repeated calls to Brat\u2019s office haven\u2019t yielded any information about when he plans to hold his next town hall meeting.\n\u201cI certainly am not paid at all,\u201d said Shields, who is a graduate student.\u00a0\u201cNot at all, and I don\u2019t know anyone else who has tried to contact this man who is. I\u2019m deeply concerned to see him say that.\u201d\nThe people who make up the group have a wide range of jobs, she said, including teachers, students and health care professionals.\nBrat\u2019s office did not return a request for comment on why the congressman said the effort was being pushed by paid activists.\n\u201cI thought a town hall was so that we can have a constructive conversation,\u201d Shields said. \u201cI have constructive criticism \u2015 and not even necessarily criticism, just constructive input.\u201d\nShe said she\u2019d like to talk to Brat about whether he would be in favor of allowing gender rating\u00a0\u2015 the practice of charging different premiums based on gender \u2015 and whether he supported allowing pregnancy to be defined as a pre-existing condition. The latter issue has cost Shields thousands of dollars, she said.\u00a0\nBrat isn\u2019t the only Republican facing pushback against efforts to repeal Obamacare. In Colorado, 150 people showed up at one of Rep. Mike Coffman\u2019s (R) town halls to urge him not repeal the health care law. It was such an overwhelming response that Coffman only allowed\u00a0four people at a time into the room.\u00a0\nIn a Facebook note posted on Monday, Brat said he was too busy to host a town hall in his district.\n\u201cOver the past couple of weeks my office has been inundated with phone calls, and emails and comments on social media requesting a town hall meeting, and believe me, I fully intend to have plenty of town halls that are open and transparent as soon as our first 100 days agenda is implemented and we come up for a breath of air,\u201d he wrote.\nHowever, he does plan to appear with Rep. Paul Gosar at a town hall in Arizona\u00a0in late February.\nBrat held a last minute Facebook Live town hall Tuesday evening on Facebook Live. A staffer took questions and summarized them to Brat, who then responded with talking points, according to Shields. Even though many people felt the format wasn\u2019t ideal, Shields says she still plans to call Brat\u2019s office Wednesday to thank him for holding the event.\nThe pressure on Brat to hold a town hall is particular notable because he defeated Rep. Eric Cantor in 2014 when Cantor was the No.\u00a02 Republican in the House. Many Republicans felt Cantor had fallen out of touch with his district.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realize the purpose of a town hall was to be a pep rally,\u201d Shields said.\u00a0\u201cI thought it was about having free and open discourse with your representative, which is the backbone of the Republic.\u201d\nShields said that Brat\u2019s Saturday comments made her even more motivated to put pressure on him.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t necessarily the words that he used it was the idea behind the whole thing, which is \u2018oh my god, God forbid women of the 7th District should have an opinion that they want to tell their congressman,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThat really struck a nerve.\u201d", "date": "\n01/31/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dave-brat-in-my-grill_n_5890ae88e4b0c90eff001cc5", "tags": "congressman obamacare grill repeal town gop complains \u201d facebook brat district women hall shields"}
