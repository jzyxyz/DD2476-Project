{"title": "Trump Withdraws White House Invite To NBA Champions", "content": "The Golden State Warriors are apparently no longer welcome at the White House.\nOn Saturday morning, President Donald Trump revealed via Twitter that he\u2019d withdrawn an offer to greet the NBA champions at his official residence.\n\u201cGoing to the White House is considered a great honor for a championship team,\u201d wrote Trump. \u201cStephen Curry is hesitating, therefore invitation is withdrawn.\u201d\nThough it was unclear from Trump\u2019s tweet whether he meant to shun the entire team, the Warriors said in a statement on Saturday that Trump \u201cmade it clear that we are not invited.\u201d\nThe team said members planned to use their time in Washington instead to\u00a0 \u00a0highlight \u201cdiversity and inclusion.\u201d\nThere was some confusion over whether Trump even extended an invitation to uphold the tradition of celebrating a title with the NBA champions, which dates back to\u00a0former President John F. Kennedy\u2019s\u00a0administration.\nThat\u2019s because, per ESPN, Trump reportedly\u00a0didn\u2019t make the traditional presidential congratulatory call\u00a0and White House offer to the team following\u00a0their 4-1 series win\u00a0over the Cleveland Cavaliers in June.\nTrump\u2019s move comes a day after point guard Curry explained why he was against his team celebrating the title with Trump.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to go. That\u2019s the nucleus of my belief. If it was just me, it would be a pretty short conversation,\u201d Curry told reporters during Golden State\u2019s media day.\u00a0\n\u201cBy not going, hopefully it will inspire some change\u00a0for what we tolerate in this country and what we stand for, what is accepted and what we turn a blind eye toward,\u201d Curry added.\nHis teammate, Kevin Durant, previously expressed a similar position.\nThe Cavaliers\u2019 LeBron James indicated earlier that he wouldn\u2019t have visited the White House had his team won. Several members of the champion New England Patriots NFL team, including quarterback Tom Brady, did not attend a White House ceremony in April to mark their Super Bowl win.\nThis article has been updated to include the Warriors\u2019 statement.", "date": "\n09/23/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-white-house-nba-champions_n_59c65aede4b06ddf45f83bbb", "tags": "invite warriors golden team white trump house \u201d state nba curry withdraws champions"}
