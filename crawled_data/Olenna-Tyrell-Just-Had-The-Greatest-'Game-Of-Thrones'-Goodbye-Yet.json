{"title": "Olenna Tyrell Just Had The Greatest 'Game Of Thrones' Goodbye Yet", "content": "WARNING: Spoilers ahead for \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d Season 7!\u00a0\nThings aren\u2019t looking great for Daenerys (Emilia Clarke) and co. in the world of \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d but if the Lannisters hadn\u2019t messed with Dany\u2019s plan, we wouldn\u2019t have been able to witness the epicness that was Olenna Tyrell (Diana Rigg) taking down Jaime (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) as only she can.\u00a0\nIn the final minutes of Season 7, Episode 3, \u201cThe Queen\u2019s Justice,\u201d the Lannisters invade Highgarden and Jaime informs Olenna that her time in Westeros is over. But, come on, we all know Olenna is not one to leave without uttering the last word!\nAs Jaime assures Olenna that he convinced Cersei (Lena Headey)\u00a0to let her die a painless death \u2015 poison in wine \u2015 the Tyrell matriarch reveals that she, not Tyrion (Peter Dinklage), was the one to poison Joffrey (Jack Gleeson) at his own wedding.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019d hate to die like your son. Clawing at my neck, foam and bile spilling from my mouth, eyes blood red, skin purple. Must have been horrible for you, as a Kingsguard, as a father. It was horrible enough for me \u2015 a shocking scene. Not at all what I intended,\u201d she tells a heartbroken Jaime before adding: \u201cTell Cersei. I want her to know it was me.\u201d\u00a0\nAlthough we as an audience knew Olenna conspired to kill Joffrey at his wedding to her granddaughter Margaery (Natalie Dormer), Cersei has always blamed Tyrion and Sansa (Sophie Turner). She\u2019ll most likely be surprised to know that her little brother had nothing to do with it.\u00a0\nConsidering what she did to Myrcella\u2019s (Nell Tiger Free) killer Ellaria Sand (Indira Varma) in the episode, we can assume that if Cersei knew Olenna\u2019s part in Joffrey\u2019s death, her own end would\u2019ve been much more painful.\u00a0\nAs it stands,\u00a0let us raise a glass to Diana Rigg\u2019s unforgettable performance as Olenna Tyrell. She shall be sorely missed. (And we\u2019re not just saying that for Dany\u2019s sake.)\n\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d airs Sundays at 9 p.m. ET on HBO.\u00a0", "date": "\n07/30/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/olenna-tyrell-game-of-thrones_n_597e9053e4b02a4ebb763aeb", "tags": "cersei game know goodbye greatest tyrell \u201d yet \u2015 olenna thrones jaime"}
