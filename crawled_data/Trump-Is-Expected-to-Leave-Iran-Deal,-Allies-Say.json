{"title": "Trump Is Expected to Leave Iran Deal, Allies Say", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump is expected to announce on Tuesday that he is withdrawing the United States from the Iran nuclear deal, European diplomats said after concluding that they had failed to convince him that reneging on America\u2019s commitment to the pact could cast the West into new confrontation with Tehran.\nIf the diplomats are correct, the announcement will be the most consequential national security decision of Mr. Trump\u2019s 15 months in office \u2014 though it could be eclipsed in coming weeks by his direct negotiation with North Korea\u2019s leader over surrendering its nuclear arsenal.\nOne senior European diplomat who has been deeply involved in trying to persuade Mr. Trump to stay in the deal told reporters on Monday the chance that the president would keep the agreement intact was \u201cvery small.\u201d\nAt the heart of the deal to limit Iran\u2019s nuclear program, which was reached in July 2015 after more than two and a half years of negotiation, lay a bold trade.\nThe West would end three decades of sanctions and isolation of Tehran that had crippled the country\u2019s economy and fueled domestic impatience with its clerical leaders. In return, Iran agreed to ship roughly 97 percent of its nuclear fuel out of the country, and forgo production of nuclear fuel, even for ostensibly peaceful purposes.\nThe negotiation with Iran was the signature foreign policy achievement of the Obama administration, and throughout the 2016 campaign Mr. Trump called it a \u201cdisaster\u201d and \u201cinsane.\u201d\nBut for more than a year, he was reluctantly persuaded by advisers that it was better than any alternative, and that the United States had no Plan B if it was the first to breach the arrangements. Those advisers \u2014 Rex W. Tillerson and Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster \u2014 were ousted in recent months and replaced with two of the Iran agreement\u2019s most vociferous critics, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and John R. Bolton, the national security adviser.\nIn the 28 months since the arrangement went into effect, international inspectors have said they have found no violations \u2014 apart from minor infractions that were quickly rectified.\nUnder the deal, the restrictions on research and development in Iran\u2019s nuclear program would begin to lift after a decade. After 15 years, Iran would be able to produce as much fuel as it wanted \u2014 though never for the purpose of making weapons.\nMr. Trump has insisted that \u201csunset clause\u201d simply put off the day when Iran would become a nuclear-armed state. The agreement, he has said, failed to address Tehran\u2019s growing missile capability and expanding influence in the Middle East \u2014 all funded, he insisted, from cash that was returned to the Iranians as a part of the deal, as well as its resumed oil trade.\nThe senior European diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity when meeting with a group of reporters on Monday, called it \u201cpretty obvious\u201d that Mr. Trump would no longer waive American sanctions against Iran, as he has done since the start of his presidency to uphold the deal.\nRather than push the issues off for another decade, Mr. Trump is betting he can force Iran into a new negotiation.\nIt is unclear whether the president might mollify three major allies \u2014 Britain, France and Germany \u2014 by allowing them to maintain economic relations with Tehran without penalizing any of their firms. But European officials said that was not clear.\nMr. Trump issued two tweets on Monday about the coming decision. The first berated John Kerry, the former secretary of state, for his \u201cpossibly illegal Shadow Diplomacy on the very badly negotiated Iran deal.\u201d It was an apparent reference to Mr. Kerry\u2019s calls to leaders around the world looking for ways to save an accord that he dedicated much of his term to negotiating during the Obama administration.\nA few hours later, Mr. Trump turned to Twitter again to declare that he would be announcing his decision at 2 p.m. Tuesday at the White House.\nHowever the White House engineers the specifics of the announcement, diplomats say they are now adjusting to a new reality in which the fundamental trade with Iran is dead.\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be saved,\u201d said Aaron David Miller, a longtime former diplomat now at the Wilson International Center for Scholars. \u201cWhatever Trump decides, it\u2019s the beginning of the end of the accord, either death by one, or 1,000, cuts.\u201d\nOver the past three weeks, senior officials from France, Britain and Germany flew to Washington to make a case that ditching the accord was a diplomatic mistake. On Sunday, Boris Johnson, the British foreign secretary, was the last to make those arguments, writing in The New York Times that \u201cnow that these handcuffs are in place, I see no possible advantage in casting them aside.\u201d\nBy the middle of Monday, his visit seemed a last gasp: He was told that the decision was all but preordained, officials said.\nPresident Emmanuel Macron of France and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany similarly argued that the Iran accord was flawed but could be built upon. The allies had suggested that the West could impose new sanctions against Iran\u2019s ballistic missile development and armed support for the Syrian regime, for Hezbollah, for Hamas and Islamic Jihad in the Palestinian territories \u2014 but keep the nuclear deal intact.\n\u201cMy view \u2014 I don\u2019t know what your president will decide \u2014 is that he will get rid of this deal on his own, for domestic reasons,\u201d Mr. Macron told a group of reporters in Washington during his visit last month.\nBut it has been difficult for Europeans to answer Mr. Trump\u2019s demands because it is clear that Iran will not agree to reopening the terms of the accord itself. And if it were to be reopened, Iran had a series of demands of its own.\nShould Mr. Trump withdraw from the accord, Iran could accurately claim that Washington was the first to violate it \u2014 a propaganda win. And Iran would be free, if it chose, to resume fuel production, according to diplomats who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive negotiations.\nThe mantra of the European negotiators toiling to retain the nuclear deal has been \u201cto fix it, not nix it.\u201d But Mr. Trump has come at the problem from a different perspective: He argues that the only solution is a clean slate.\nMr. Trump has told visitors he believes that once the current agreement is destroyed, Iran will come to the table to negotiate a new one. Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, who negotiated the initial accord with Mr. Kerry for more than two years, has said Tehran will not participate in such negotiations since it already spent years doing so.\nThe narrow decision Mr. Trump will have to announce on Tuesday is whether he is willing to once again waive American sanctions on Iran, holding up America\u2019s commitments under the deal.\nYet even if Mr. Trump reimposes those sanctions, Europeans note that there are some delays built into the accord \u2014 a reconciliation period of about a month, and delays of 120 to 180 days before renewed American sanctions bite.\nIn a world of Trump brinkmanship, all that could allow time for further negotiations.\nIran can go to the brink as well, however, and anticipating its response is difficult. Hard-liners are already arguing to resume uranium enrichment and plutonium production. But it is entirely possible Iran will choose to abide by the deal for now, to make sharper the split between the United States and its European allies.\nThat may not be sustainable, European officials said. Over time, pressure will grow inside Iran to leave, since many there believe the sanctions relief has not led to the kind of national economic revival that the country\u2019s public was told to expect.\nIran\u2019s leaders have been cryptic about its potential response.\n\u201cIf America leaves the nuclear deal, this will entail historic regret for it,\u201d President Hassan Rouhani of Iran said in a speech broadcast live on state television in recent days.\n\u201cIf we can get what we want from a deal without America, then Iran will continue to remain committed to the deal,\u201d Mr. Rouhani said.\nThe Europeans are also worried that abandoning the deal will embolden Israel in its own struggle with Iran in Syria and Lebanon. That could lead to another bloody war, as Iranian troops and proxies move closer to the occupied Golan Heights and Tehran continues to ship missiles into Syria and southern Lebanon.\nOddly, while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has led the charge to persuade Mr. Trump to abandon the deal, his top military advisers have dissented. The commander of the Israeli Defense Forces, Gadi Eizenkot, has repeatedly said that the agreement \u201cis working\u201d and delaying Iran\u2019s efforts to obtain a weapon by a decade to 15 years. Former military officials have largely agreed.\nBut Mr. Trump\u2019s base of supporters has insisted that the deal essentially sold out long-range American interests. After hesitating, Mr. Trump appears to have decided to make good on his past promises.", "date": "May 7, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/07/us/politics/trump-announce-withdraw-us-iran-deal.html", "tags": "allies iran leave nuclear \u201d trump expected say \u2014 deal"}
