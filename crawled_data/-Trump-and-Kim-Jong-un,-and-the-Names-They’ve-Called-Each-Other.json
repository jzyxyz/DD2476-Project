{"title": " Trump and Kim Jong-un, and the Names They\u2019ve Called Each Other", "content": "After months of escalating tensions between North Korea and the United States, officials made a stunning announcement on Thursday: Kim Jong-un, the North\u2019s leader, had invited President Trump to meet and discuss his country\u2019s nuclear program \u2014 and Mr. Trump accepted.\nThe report is particularly surprising given that no sitting American president has ever met with a North Korean leader, and that Mr. Trump himself had ruled out direct talks unless North Korea agreed to take measurable steps toward relinquishing its nuclear arsenal.\nThat, and for the last year, the two leaders have been trading insults. Here are some of the most notable things Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim have said about each other.\n(If you\u2019d like to know more about today\u2019s news, here\u2019s our article and a transcript of the announcement.)\n\u201cCrazy Dennis Rodman is saying I wanted to go to North Korea with him. Never discussed, no interest, last place on Earth I want to go to.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Trump, in a tweet, more than a year after Mr. Rodman visited North Korea and watched a basketball exhibition with Mr. Kim\n\u201cAnd nobody ever mentions North Korea where you have this maniac sitting there and he actually has nuclear weapons and somebody better start thinking about North Korea and perhaps a couple of other places. But certainly North Korea.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Trump, at a Republican presidential debate\n\u201cI would get China to make that guy disappear in one form or another very quickly.\u201d\n\u201cI mean this guy\u2019s a bad dude \u2014 and don\u2019t underestimate him.\u201d\n\u201cAny young guy that can take over from his father with all those generals and everybody else that probably wants the position, this is not somebody to be underestimated.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Trump, speaking about Mr. Kim on \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d during the presidential campaign\n\u201cNorth Korea has just launched another missile. Does this guy have anything better to do with his life?\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Trump, in a tweet,  ridiculing Mr. Kim\n\u201cNorth Korea best not make any more threats to the United States. They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Trump, to reporters at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J., on a working vacation\n\u201cKim Jong Un of North Korea made a very wise and well reasoned decision. The alternative would have been both catastrophic and unacceptable!\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Trump, in a tweet, praising Mr. Kim\u2019s decision not to fire missiles toward Guam, a United States territory\n\u201cThe United States has great strength and patience, but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea. Rocket Man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Trump, in his first address to the United Nations General Assembly\n\u201cA frightened dog barks louder.\u201d\n\u201cHe is unfit to hold the prerogative of supreme command of a country, and he is surely a rogue and a gangster fond of playing with fire, rather than a politician.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever Trump might have expected, he will face results beyond his expectation. I will surely and definitely tame the mentally deranged U.S. dotard with fire.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Kim, responding in a statement to President Trump\u2019s threat\n\u201cKim Jong Un of North Korea, who is obviously a madman who doesn't mind starving or killing his people, will be tested like never before!\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Trump, responding to Mr. Kim in a tweet hours later\n\u201cWhy would Kim Jong-un insult me by calling me \u2018old,\u2019 when I would NEVER call him \u2018short and fat?\u2019 Oh well, I try so hard to be his friend \u2014 and maybe someday that will happen!\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Trump, in a tweet, after Mr. Kim\u2019s government called Mr. Trump an \u201cold lunatic\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a mere threat but a reality that I have a nuclear button on the desk in my office.\u201d \n\u201cAll of the mainland United States is within the range of our nuclear strike.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Kim, in his annual New Year\u2019s Day speech\n\u201cNorth Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the \u2018Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times.\u2019 Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Trump, responding in a tweet\n\u201cI probably have a very good relationship with Kim Jong Un.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Trump, in an interview with The Wall Street Journal\n\u201cPresident Moon noted that North Korea-United States dialogue must take place soon in order to improve South-North Korean relations and to find a fundamental solution to the Korean Peninsula issue. To this, the North Korean delegates responded that the North was quite willing to start talks with the United States and agreed that relations between North and South Korea and those between the North and the United States should develop simultaneously.\u201d\n\u2014 Kim Eui-kyeom, a spokesman for President Moon Jae-in of South Korea\n\u201cWe want to talk also \u2026 [but] only under the right conditions.\u201d\n\u201cOtherwise we\u2019re not talking.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Trump in remarks to American governors at the White House the next day\n\u201cThe North Korean side clearly stated its willingness to denuclearize.\u201d\n\u201cIt made it clear that it would have no reason to keep nuclear weapons if the military threat to the North was eliminated and its security guaranteed.\u201d\n\u2014 A statement from South Korean envoys who met with Mr. Kim\n\u201cKim Jong Un talked about denuclearization with the South Korean Representatives, not just a freeze. Also, no missile testing by North Korea during this period of time. Great progress being made but sanctions will remain until an agreement is reached. Meeting being planned!\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Trump, in a tweet, after news broke of North Korea\u2019s invitation", "date": "March 9, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/09/world/asia/trump-kim-jong-un.html", "tags": "korea \u201c united states trump called jong-un kim north \u2014 names"}
