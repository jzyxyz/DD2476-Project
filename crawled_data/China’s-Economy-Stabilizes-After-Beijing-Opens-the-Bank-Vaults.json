{"title": "China\u2019s Economy Stabilizes After Beijing Opens the Bank Vaults", "content": "BEIJING \u2014 China\u2019s economy stabilized in the first three months of the year, according to official figures released on Wednesday, after Beijing flooded the financial system with money in a whatever-it-takes approach to arrest a slowdown.\nOfficials said that the Chinese economy, the world\u2019s second largest, grew 6.4 percent in the year\u2019s first quarter compared with the same period in 2018. The pace matched that of the fourth quarter, when growth suffered as shoppers pared back, the stock market slumped and private businesses pleaded for help.\nWhile economists generally regard China\u2019s economic figures with skepticism, they point to signs that the country\u2019s current slowdown may have reached bottom. Other figures suggest shoppers are back at the tills, factory output is ticking up and the world, after several tough months, is buying more Chinese goods. Beijing needs such hopeful signals as it tries to reach a trade deal with the Trump administration while under pressure to lift conditions at home.\nOfficials \u201cspared no effort to put the policies into effect,\u201d and growth in the first quarter \u201claid a sound foundation for the stable and healthy economic development of the whole year,\u201d said Mao Shengyong, a spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics.\nThere is a caveat: The signs of improvement most likely do not stem from a sudden burst of confidence in the strength of the country\u2019s economy among Chinese business leaders.\nInstead, the positive glimmers are largely a product of the hundreds of billions of dollars that Beijing has pumped into the country\u2019s economy in recent months, as well as the loans that officials have pressed state-run banks to make to businesses. All of that comes at a cost, and it raises a question about how willing Beijing is to spend to keep growth going.\n\u201cThis time they used an overwhelming amount of force to boost the economy,\u201d said Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie Group. \u201cThat is why the economy stabilized in the first quarter.\u201d\nThe chance of a \u201cdouble dip,\u201d in which growth drops again before picking up later this year, is high, Mr. Hu added. \u201cThe recovery is not that solid,\u201d he said. \u201cThey front-loaded the policy firepower at the start of the year.\u201d\nThe data on Wednesday also revealed that state-owned enterprises picked up much of the slack in economic activity, with investment from those industrial giants rising while investment by private companies slowed.\nIn many ways, China\u2019s policymakers are reverting to an earlier approach: doling out more loans in exchange for a short-term increase in confidence. The strategy helped keep growth surging over the past decade, even after the 2008 global financial crisis. But it left the country awash in debt that threatens to hamper the economy in the years ahead.\nIn the early years of China\u2019s boom, companies and local governments could borrow liberally knowing that accelerating growth could help ensure that their gambles paid off. Now that the country\u2019s economy is huge and maturing, it has become increasingly difficult for China to simply grow its way out of its debt.\n\u201cChina already is in the midst of the largest credit bubble the world has ever seen,\u201d said Victor Shih, an associate professor at the University of California, San Diego. And, Professor Shih added, the Chinese government has not been able to wean itself off its debt habit.\n\u201cThe government simply cannot afford to think about the medium term and must focus on short-term continuation of the credit bubble,\u201d he said.\nThe latest round of government-driven financial largess was remarkable in size and scale, economists said.\nThe broadest measure of new borrowing in China, known as total social financing, jumped to $1.2 trillion in the first quarter, while bank lending hit a record high of $865 billion, according to central bank statistics.\nLocal governments, encouraged by the central government, raised $100 billion in new money through special bonds, compared with just $11.5 billion in the first quarter of last year, when the same local governments were scolded for borrowing too much and hiding their debts.\nThis money started to show up in the economic data on Wednesday, with a jump in spending for massive infrastructure projects like toll roads and new subway lines. .\nOn Tuesday, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development warned of the potential hazards of such heavy borrowing, saying it could yield bigger economic imbalances in the future. The organization revised its outlook for China\u2019s growth to 6.2 percent for this year and 6 percent for 2020, citing the heightened risks of a housing collapse and growing geopolitical tensions.\nEven as it struggles through an economic slowdown, China is a \u201cmajor driver of world economic growth,\u201d Ludger Schuknecht, the organization\u2019s deputy secretary general, said in a report.\n\u201cYet China is at a crossroads, facing serious domestic and external challenges to maintaining its strong position over the long term,\u201d Mr. Schuknecht said. The organization also warned that the country\u2019s trade war with the United States would weigh on exports and overall growth.\nAs it searches for engines to power growth globally, the world needs China to pull through economically. Last year, Beijing reported that growth had softened to its slowest pace since 1990 amid mounting signs that the trade war was already beginning to take a toll, spooking investors. New export orders dropped to multiyear lows, prompting factories to cut overtime and send workers home early before the Chinese holiday season.\nThe world can turn once again to Chinese shoppers, if the data this quarter is any indication. Chinese shoppers helped to push retail sales up by 8.3 percent in the first three months of the year, though car sales were still low and the figure was unimpressive by the standard of the past couple of years.\n\u201cEarly signs that consumption growth may be stabilizing is really the big story,\u201d said Shaun Roache, chief economist for Asia Pacific at S&P Global.\nCompanies also appeared to have more resources to hire and expand in the first three months of the year. Some of this was the result of a pledge last year by the central bank to pump $175 billion into the system, mostly to help small and midsize companies.\nAlthough the data remains weak for manufacturers, the sector saw a double-digit jump in revenue in the first three months of the year compared with the last quarter of 2018, according to the economic consulting firm China Beige Book.\nMaking deep cuts to corporate taxes is among the new policies Beijing hopes will stimulate economic activity. The State Council, China\u2019s cabinet, has announced a series of such cuts that are expected to free up $300 billion to help jump-start the economy.\nIf its current measures do not work, Beijing could try more unconventional policies to stimulate struggling sectors like the property market.\nThat sector, which by some measures accounts for up to 30 percent of China\u2019s economic activity, is saddled with too many unsold apartments and many unfinished development projects. The slowdown in property sales and the glut of empty apartments \u2014 65 million units, according to one estimate \u2014 have started to worry economists. New housing starts this year are down from the same period last year. Land sales also dropped in the first quarter and could continue to fall.\nConstruction and investment data on Wednesday showed early signs of a turnaround. Prices of homes stabilized, and investment in the real estate sector rose at a faster pace than last year over the same period.\nChinese officials have said they have a handle on what they see as a modest slowdown. Economists say the government still needs to get the debt problem fully under control.\n\u201cThis rally didn\u2019t appear out of nowhere,\u201d analysts at China Beige Book wrote, \u201cand there are at least three compelling reasons to doubt its staying power: credit, credit and credit.\u201d\nAddressing China\u2019s expansive monetary policy on Wednesday morning, Mr. Mao conceded that \u201cdownward pressure on the economy still exists,\u201d both from a global economic slowdown and from what he described as China\u2019s own \u201cstructural contradictions.\u201d\nHe added: \u201c6.4 percent is still less than last year\u2019s full year growth.\u201d", "date": "April 16, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/16/business/china-economy-first-quarter.html", "tags": "opens stabilizes china growth first beijing bank \u201d economy economic year vaults"}
