It has developed into one of Asia's most affluent nations.\nA government-sponsored industrial push in the 1960s led to huge corporations like Samsung and Hyundai being created.\nSouth Korea is one of the world's top 20 economies, with GDP of $1.4tn (\u00a31tn).\nBy contrast, North Korea's GDP is less than $20bn, placing it well outside the top 100 economies.\nIt has a communist system, but capitalism is creeping into the country. \nThere are things to buy - but only for some people, those who have money. The majority of people in North Korea live in poverty. \nKim Jong-un has made clear that development is a priority.", "date": "12 May 2018", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-44091279", "tags": "us rebuild mr korean pyongyang denuclearises help economy pompeo n south kim north korea offers"}
