{"title": "Modern Love College Essay Contest", "content": "This past February, just after Valentine\u2019s Day, we asked college students nationwide to tell us the truth about what love is like for them today. Ten weeks later, we are pleased to present the best of that writing, which will run in the Modern Love column through May.\nLeading off is our winning entry by Kyleigh Leddy, a senior at Boston College. Many writers explored how technology and social media can both enable and frustrate emotional attachment, but none carried greater weight and poignancy than Ms. Leddy\u2019s essay about her missing older sister. Our other finalists tackled a wide range of subjects: hoarding, body image, rejecting oppressive masculine codes of behavior, and having a relationship prosper and end via Apple\u2019s Find My Friends app.\nThis year\u2019s contest will also feature a variety of 100-word love stories from college students around the world, which will run in our Tiny Love Stories column for three Tuesdays in May, starting next week.\nCongratulations to Ms. Leddy and our other top finishers (listed below), and our gratitude to all who participated. Thanks, as well, to contest readers Katherine Hu, Danya Issawi, Miya Lee and Alexandra Petri. \u2014 Daniel Jones\nWinner\nKyleigh Leddy, Boston College\nFinalists\nRicardo Jaramillo, Brown University\nJames Lee, Brown University\nMeaghan Mahoney, Columbia University\nKarina Manta, University of Colorado, Colorado Springs\nHonorable Mention\nAmaris Ramey, Georgia Gwinnett College\nPaige Resnick, University of Chicago\nSamantha Resnick, Pomona College\nVeronica Suchodolski, Barnard College\nSahana Thirumazhusai, Carnegie Mellon University\nNotable Essays\nAvital Balwit, University of Virginia\nEliza Browning, Wheaton College\nKelsang Dolma, Yale University\nMorgan Florsheim, Brown University\nSarah Haeckel, Colgate University\nSarah Lieberman, Cornell University\nCole Martin, University of Chicago\nCadence Neenan, Tulane University\nAbey Philip, Yale University\nLily Robinson, Middlesex Community College\nKate Scherzinger, Notre Dame\nSara Stanworth, Utah Valley University\nKate Tinney, UC Berkeley\nPatrick Wigent, Carleton College\nQianqian Yang, Harvard College", "date": "Feb. 15, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/03/style/modern-love-college-essay-contest.html", "tags": "may college leddy essay column run contest university brown love kyleigh modern students"}
