{"title": "Trump's Washington Still Offended By Vulgarity, The Word 'Pussy'", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2015 The presidency of Donald Trump has apparently not coarsened the sensibilities of this city\u2019s movers and shakers, as political and media figures are in the throes of a not-quite-annual tradition of taking umbrage over jokes at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner.\u00a0\nComedian Michelle Wolf on Saturday night\u00a0fantasized about a tree falling on Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway and likened White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders to a butch softball coach.\n\u201cEvery time Sarah steps up to the podium, I get excited because I\u2019m not really sure what we\u2019re going to get: you know, a press briefing, a bunch of lies or divided into softball teams,\u201d Wolf said.\nThen, in a husky voice: \u201cIt\u2019s shirts and skins, and this time, don\u2019t be such a little bitch, Jim Acosta!\u201d\nA consensus emerged Sunday morning that Wolf \u201ctook it too far,\u201d as Politico\u2019s Playbook newsletter put it. Several prominent journalists shared similar sentiments on Twitter.\nFormer Trump spokesman Sean Spicer called Wolf\u2019s routine \u201ca disgrace\u201d on Twitter.\u00a0National Security Advisor John Bolton called it \u201creprehensible\u201d on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d\u00a0\nTrump ally Chris Christie, the former Republican governor of New Jersey, said Wolf had unfairly harped on Sanders\u2019 physical appearance.\u00a0\n\u201cThis female comedian spent more time beating up on women last night than she did on men,\u201d Christie said on ABC News\u2019 \u201cThis Week with George Stephanopoulos.\u201d\u00a0\nBut the criticism extended past the Sanders jokes. The Drudge Report hyperventilated that Wolf made light of abortion and used the words \u201corgasm\u201d and \u201cNazi.\u201d In his morning newsletter for Axios, Mike Allen declared the event a \u201cwin\u201d for Trump over the media. Among other things, Allen complained that Wolf used the word \u201cpussy.\u201d\n\u2033She made several uses of a vulgarity that begins with \u2018p,\u2019 in an audience filled with Washington officials, top journalists and a few baseball legends,\u201d Allen wrote.\nTrump, as he did last year, broke with tradition by not attending the dinner; he instead traveled to Michigan for a political rally before an adoring audience. But he couldn\u2019t resist weighing in on Twitter with a post that included the recommendation that next year\u2019s gala be hosted by Fox News\u2019 Greg Gutfeld (considered by some a comedian).\u00a0\nOf course, nobody in American media or politics has done more to inject the word \u201cpussy\u201d into political discourse than Trump himself,\u00a0owner of the infamous boast caught on video in 2005 that he liked to \u201cgrab \u2019em by the pussy\u201d and got away with it because he was a star.\u00a0\nEmily Nussbaum, The New Yorker\u2019s Pulitzer-winning TV critic, took the contrarian view on Wolf\u2019s routine.\u00a0\n\u201cThe more I think about it, the more impressed I am that Michelle Wolf did such a harsh act WITHOUT insulting any woman\u2019s looks,\u201d Nussbaum said on Twitter.\u00a0 \u201cShe aimed straight at the white female enforcers & never once suggested that anyone was a bimbo or a dog \u2015 like the man they work for surely would have,\u201d\u00a0\nNussbaum pointed out that Trump has routinely attacked the physical appearance of women who have criticized him or accused him of sexual harassment.\nStill, Wolf\u2019s jokes at the correspondents\u2019 dinner were probably the most controversial since Stephen Colbert roasted then-President George W. Bush and the media at the 2006 affair. Many journalists said Colbert went too far with his gibes.\u00a0\n\u201cI believe the government that governs best is the government that governs least,\u201d\u00a0Colbert said in the faux-conservative persona he was known for at the time.\u00a0\u201cAnd by these standards, we have set up a fabulous government in Iraq.\u201d\nAs for the media coverage of the Bush administration, he said: \u201cHere\u2019s how it works. The president makes decisions. He\u2019s the decider. The press secretary announces those decisions, and you people of the press type those decisions down. Make, announce, type. Just put \u2019em through a spell check and go home. ... Write that novel you got kicking around in your head. You know, the one about the intrepid Washington reporter with the courage to stand up to the administration. You know, fiction!\u201d", "date": "\n04/29/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/white-house-correspondents-dinner_n_5ae5d72fe4b055fd7fccb355", "tags": "word washington \u201c media wolf vulgarity twitter trump time press offended said still"}
