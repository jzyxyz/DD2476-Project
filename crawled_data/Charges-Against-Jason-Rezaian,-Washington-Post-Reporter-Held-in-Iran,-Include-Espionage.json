{"title": "Charges Against Jason Rezaian, Washington Post Reporter Held in Iran, Include Espionage", "content": "Jason Rezaian, the Washington Post correspondent incarcerated in Iran for nine months, has been charged with four serious crimes including espionage, his Iranian lawyer said on Monday. The newspaper and the White House denounced the charges, calling them absurd.\nOne of the counts, the lawyer, Leilah Ahsan, said in a statement, accused Mr. Rezaian of having broken the law by writing a letter to President Obama.\n\u201cJason is a journalist, and it is in the nature of his profession to gain access to information and publish\u201d it, she said in her first substantive comment on the case. \u201cMy client, however, has never had any direct or indirect access to classified information to share with anyone.\u201d\nHer disclosure provided the most detail yet in the prosecution of Mr. Rezaian, whose imprisonment, interrogation and mistreatment in a penitentiary in Tehran have added tensions to the difficult relations between Iran and the United States.\nBoth countries, which broke diplomatic relations 35 years ago after the Islamic Revolution, are in the final months of negotiations aimed at resolving a protracted dispute over Iran\u2019s nuclear activities. The Rezaian case is increasingly seen as intertwined with the outcome of those negotiations, which have been promoted by both President Hassan Rouhani of Iran and Mr. Obama. The negotiations face a June 30 deadline.\nThe possibility of a thaw in the Iranian-American relationship that could emerge from such an agreement has angered hard-line elements in Iran\u2019s hierarchy. Recent reports in Iranian news media with particularly anti-American views have called Mr. Rezaian a spy with links to Iranian expatriates in the United States and Europe.\nThe Washington Post\u2019s executive editor, Martin Baron, said in a statement that the charges outlined by Mr. Rezaian\u2019s lawyer, believed to carry a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison, \u201ccould not be more ludicrous.\u201d\nThe Obama administration said it had not seen the actual charges but was aware of the reporting about them. \u201cIf the reports are true these charges are absurd, should be immediately dismissed, and Jason should be freed immediately,\u201d the White House spokesman, Josh Earnest, said at a daily news briefing in Washington.\nAccording to Ms. Ahsan\u2019s statement, translated from Persian and provided by the family of the journalist, Mr. Rezaian has been accused by the prosecutor in Tehran of \u201cespionage through collecting policies regarding the country\u2019s domestic and foreign policy and providing them to individuals with malicious intent.\u201d\nMs. Ahsan said in the statement that Mr. Rezaian had also been \u201caccused of collaborating with hostile governments as well as writing a letter to President Obama.\u201d It was unclear from her statement how precisely such an act could be deemed illegal. Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has exchanged letters with Mr. Obama.\nThe other charges, she said, related to collecting classified information and \u201cpropaganda against the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran.\u201d\nThe Revolutionary Court in Tehran that is overseeing Mr. Rezaian\u2019s case has not officially announced the charges and has not set a trial date.\nMs. Ahsan, who only recently was permitted to read the case file against her client, had not been permitted to confer with him until Monday, and that meeting apparently took place under heavy scrutiny. Her statement said that they met in court with an official translator present.\n\u201cAll of the items and accusations are the ones that I mentioned and I cannot divulge details because the trial has not yet begun,\u201d she said in the statement. But she said the case file presented no evidence to justify the charges against Mr. Rezaian.\nMs. Ahsan also drew a direct link to the nuclear discussions and the Rezaian case in her statement: \u201cEven though legal affairs are outside the bounds of politics, I hope the nuclear talks and its developments will have a positive effect on a speedy release of my client.\u201d\nMr. Rezaian, a 39-year-old Californian of Iranian descent, has been The Post\u2019s Tehran bureau chief since 2012. Before that he had worked in Tehran as a freelance reporter. The Iranian government has refused to acknowledge his American citizenship.\nMr. Baron, who has repeatedly protested what he has called the \u201cKafkaesque\u201d prosecution of Mr. Rezaian, said the lawyer\u2019s statement amounted to more evidence of his innocence.\n\u201cWhatever its motive, Iran\u2019s judiciary is presenting the claims that are transparently baseless,\u201d Mr. Baron said.\n\u201cIt is absurd and despicable to assert, as Iran\u2019s judiciary is now claiming, that Jason\u2019s work first as a freelance reporter and then as The Post\u2019s correspondent in Tehran amounted to espionage or otherwise posed any threat to Iranian national security,\u201d he added.\nMr. Rezaian, his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, and two other people were arrested July 22. Ms. Salehi, an Iranian who works for a United Arab Emirates newspaper, and the two others, both Iranian citizens, were released on bail and warned not to talk about the case.\nMs. Ahsan\u2019s meeting with Mr. Rezaian came a few days after Iranian media organizations that are linked to outspoken critics of the United States published unattributed articles claiming sinister revelations in Mr. Rezaian\u2019s case.\nThe Vatan-e Emrouz newspaper, which supported the government of former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, said Mr. Rezaian had collaborated with the National Iranian American Council, a Washington-based advocacy group that supports nuclear negotiations and improved relations with Iran, although it also has been critical of the Iranian government. But inside Iran, hard-liners say the group is connected to another former president, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, known to favor ties and business with the West.\nThe newspaper\u2019s coverage focused on the founder and president of the council, Trita Parsi, and one of his aides, Reza Marashi, a former State Department employee, who regularly engaged in public conversations with Mr. Rezaian on Twitter.\n\u201cThese two men are present at the nuclear negotiating table,\u201d the paper wrote of Mr. Parsi and Mr. Marashi, who have been photographed in the presence of Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, during talks with world powers in Switzerland. \u201cMr. Rezaian was in contact with them.\u201d\nMs. Ahsan, who also represents Mr. Rezaian\u2019s wife, criticized such coverage in her statement. \u201cThe whole of the investigation into my client has been kept secret so far, and my clients and I have refrained from making them public,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a shame that some domestic media have resorted to the widespread publication of untrue and false accounts without considering the secret nature of the case \u2014 their action is both against the law and moral and Islamic standards.\u201d\nMr. Parsi said in a telephone interview that the prosecution of Mr. Rezaian reflected what he called the desperation of extremist opponents in Iran to derail the nuclear agreement reconciliation with the United States.\n\u201cWe all know Jason is innocent,\u201d he said. \u201cThe easiest accusation to make in Iran is to say someone is a spy.\u201d", "date": "April 20, 2015", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/21/world/middleeast/washington-post-reporter-held-in-iran-faces-4-charges-lawyer-says.html", "tags": "iran rezaian washington jason iranian espionage held \u201d charges statement post case reporter include"}
