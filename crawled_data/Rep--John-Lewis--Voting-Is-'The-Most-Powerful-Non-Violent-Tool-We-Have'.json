John Lewis (D-Ga.) on Monday implored young leaders invited to the White House to continue his generation\u2019s legacy of civil rights activism by reminding them of sacrifices that won the right to vote.\n\u201cI say to each and everyone of you, in the best way I can. I gave a little blood on the bridge, but some people gave their lives,\u201d Lewis said of the fight to pass the Voting Rights Act in 1965. \u201cThe vote is precious. It is the most powerful non-violent tool we have in a democratic society, and we must use it. And so you must go out all across America and tell young people, and people not so young, tell all of us: Vote. The vote is powerful.\u201d\nLewis was introducing a panel on social change at the White House\u2019s \u201cSouth by South Lawn\u201d festival, modeled on the famed South by Southwest in Austin, Texas, at which Obama spoke earlier this year. \nLewis advised the young people at the White House to \u201cget in trouble, what I call good trouble, necessary trouble.\u201d \nAs a student leader during the civil rights movement, Lewis was on the front lines during pivotal moments, like the 1965 Alabama march from Selma to Montgomery, when he and other protesters were tear-gassed and beaten by police crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge. The day became known as Bloody Sunday.\nLewis recounted that as a kid growing up in the segregated South, his family dissuaded him from getting involved.\n\u201cI saw those signs that said, \u2018White Men, Colored Men, White Women, Colored Women,\u2019 and I would come home and ask my mother, my father, my grandparents, \u2018Why?\u2019 And they would say, \u201cDon\u2019t get in the way. Don\u2019t get in trouble,\u2019\u201d Lewis recalled. \u201cBut one day in the 10th grade, I heard of Rosa Parks. I heard the words of Martin Luther King on the radio. The action of Rosa Parks, the words of Martin Luther King inspired me to find a way to get in the way, to get in trouble, what I call good trouble, necessary trouble.\n\u201cIt is time for each of you as young leaders to get in trouble. Good trouble. Get in the way and make some noise. Just do it.\u201d\nThe work of the civil rights movement, Lewis said, remains relevant today in reducing discrimination and division.\n\u201cMaybe our foremothers and forefathers all came to this land in different ships, but we\u2019re all in the same boat now,\u201d Lewis said, drawing on words from the civil rights movement. \u201cAnd that is true today. So we must pull together and look out for each other. We must redeem the soul of America and create the \u2018beloved community,\u2019 a community that respects the dignity and worth of every human being.\u201d", "date": "\n10/03/2016", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/john-lewis-social-change-voting-rights_n_57f2bd99e4b0703f7590753e", "tags": "non-violent trouble voting young way rights civil tool white lewis lewis- rep- get john powerful"}
