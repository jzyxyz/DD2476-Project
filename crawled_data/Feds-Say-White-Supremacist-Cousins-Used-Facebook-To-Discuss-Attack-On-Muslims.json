{"title": "Feds Say White Supremacist Cousins Used Facebook To Discuss Attack On Muslims", "content": "FBI agents arrested a 22-year-old white supremacist who managed an extremist Facebook group and was evidently plotting a terrorist attack against Muslims with his cousin.\nFederal authorities have charged New York resident Thomas Alonzo Bolin with lying to the FBI about possessing a weapon. He appears to have first come under federal scrutiny after his cousin Austin Witkowski used Facebook to call for a re-enactment in the United States of the terrorist attack on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand.\nBolin, authorities allege, identified as a \u201cFolk Odinist\u201d and used a Facebook account under the name Peter Vincent to join multiple white supremacist Facebook groups. The feds say Bolin managed a Facebook group called Odin\u2019s Warriors and had discussions about the Christchurch terrorist attack with his cousin Witkowski (who went by the name Ragnar Odinson on Facebook).\nAccording to an affidavit from an FBI special agent on the Joint Terrorism Task Force in Buffalo, Witkowski (aka Odinson) sent threatening messages via Facebook Messenger on the day of the Christchurch attack and \u201cindicated that he was willing to \u2018do something as of next week\u2019 in Baltimore.\u201d He \u201cencouraged another individual to buy firearms and ammunition, and food, and stated that he (Odinson) would travel to meet the individual the following week,\u201d the affidavit states.\nThe day after the Christchurch attack, the feds said that Bolin told his cousin Witkowski that he had \u201cwrecked\u201d his car and broke his arm.\u00a0\n\u201cThere goes all that shit then,\u201d\u00a0Witkowski wrote, per the affidavit.\n\u201c[O]nly takes one arm to fire a glock,\u201d Bolin replied.\u00a0\n\u201cI guess I\u2019ll do this shit my self. I\u2019m not waiting months and months or a week. It was supposed to be done by Halloween,\u201d responded Witkowski, who was arrested the next day, on March 17, according to Bolin\u2019s Facebook messages, after getting into an argument with his grandfather.\u00a0\nBolin wrote on Facebook about \u201cthe invasion happening at the southern border\u201d and the \u201cdestruction of our homeland by Islamic trash.\u201d Witkowski shared the Christchurch shooter\u2019s manifesto and video, responding \u201cLovely\u201d when Bolin wrote, \u201cBrugh dude killed 40 muslims.\u201d\nBolin also wrote to his girlfriend that the victims in New Zealand were \u201cmuslim rats they would gladly do the worse to you or me\u201d and that it \u201cdoes his [heart] good to see [them] run down.\u201d\nThe feds say Bolin wrote in one message that what the Christchurch shooter did \u201cwas fucked up but politically he is making some points his focus was on the fact that the elites want to kill off the white race and replace us with a demographic they can control better. Which is fairly obvious if you look into it. His solution was extremely radical and misguided but its a good read ill send you the link to it if you want its about a 30 min read.\u201d\nIn an interview with FBI agents on March 30, Bolin said he wanted Muslims out of the country because they were \u201ccontributing to a corruption of his culture,\u201d according to the FBI affidavit. He claimed he did not possess a weapon in New York state, where he had moved in May 2018. But FBI agents searched the room he was renting and found a red devil mask and a shotgun, both of which were depicted in a photo on Bolin\u2019s Facebook account.\nBolin is being held in Monroe County Jail and is set to appear in federal court in Rochester on Friday, according to court records. Witkowski does not appear to be facing federal charges, and it\u2019s unclear if he\u2019s still in local custody.\nFBI Director Chris Wray told a House committee on Thursday that white supremacy was a \u201cpersistent\u201d and \u201cpervasive\u201d threat that the bureau confronted in both domestic terrorism and hate crime investigations.\u00a0\nThe charge against Bolin and the lack of a federal charge against his cousin illustrate the difficulties that federal authorities can face when charging domestic terrorists. Some federal law enforcement officers would like to see Congress pass a law that would make it easier to charge domestic extremists with more serious crimes, though any such law would face resistance from some civil liberties advocates.\u00a0\nRead the FBI affidavit below.\nThis story has been updated with information about domestic terrorism and FBI Director Chris Wray\u2019s comments about white supremacy.\u00a0", "date": "\n04/04/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/white-supremacist-facebook-thomas-bolin_n_5ca63188e4b05acba4de053e", "tags": "witkowski feds bolin used discuss muslims white \u201d fbi say supremacist facebook cousins federal christchurch attack"}
