{"title": "Paying Money You Owe Isn't A 'Bailout,' Mr- President", "content": "Merriam-Webster defines the word \u201cbailout\u201d as \u201ca rescue from financial distress.\u201d The concept is pretty simple: Someone does something that results in a bad outcome, and someone else helps them out of the jam. The word itself refers to bailing water out of a leaky boat, so the metaphor fits.\nIn the midst of the financial crisis that happened in the last decade, President George W. Bush and Congress bailed out the giant banks that caused the problem, concluding that this distasteful action was better than the alternative, which could have been a worldwide collapse of the financial system and a depression that would\u2019ve made the Great Recession look like a boom time. President Barack Obama bailed out the auto industry. And President George H.W. Bush bailed out failing savings and loan institutions back in the 1980s.\nPeople don\u2019t like these government bailouts. They really, really don\u2019t like them. The idea that a business made decisions so bad that the only way to prevent a catastrophe is for taxpayers to fix it doesn\u2019t sit right with Americans.\nThat\u2019s why \u201cbailout\u201d is a go-to insult politicians like to use to to describe things they don\u2019t like. This pejorative has been especially popular with Republicans in recent years. Take President Donald Trump, seen here using the term to describe a part of the Affordable Care Act.\u00a0\nTrump and members of his administration, along with a few GOP lawmakers, recently have started talking like this. It\u2019s nonsense.\nSo what\u2019s Trump referring to here? It\u2019s a once-obscure, difficult-to-explain element of the Affordable Care Act called cost-sharing reductions. Right now, it\u2019s about the most fraught subject in health policy. \nTrump is threatening to cut off the money that makes cost-sharing reductions work, which would deal instant damage to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s health insurance system and the people who rely on it. This threat might sound familiar to anyone who has followed Trump\u2019s lengthy history of not paying his business partners. \nRemember Merriam-Webster: A bailout is an action taken after something bad has occurred to help the party that did the bad thing, or at least is suffering from that bad thing. What a bailout isn\u2019t is when someone pays a bill for services rendered, or when the federal government carries out a program as written. (This isn\u2019t the first time Republicans have called an existing part of the regular structure of Obamacare a \u201cbailout.\u201d It wasn\u2019t true before, either.)\nAs most people know, the Affordable Care Act offers tax credits to low- and middle-income households that reduce the monthly premiums for health insurance policies purchased via the law\u2019s exchange marketplaces. But the lowest-income enrollees are eligible for a second kind of financial assistance \u2015 those cost-sharing reductions, sometimes called CSRs.\nHere\u2019s how they work: A person goes to the exchange and shops for coverage. If their income is low enough \u2014 up to 2.5 times the federal poverty level, which is $30,015 a year \u2014 their plans will come with lower deductibles and copayments. It\u2019s a huge benefit for these enrollees who can, for example, take a deductible in the thousands of dollars and shrink it to just hundreds. More than 7 million people\u00a0\u2015\u00a058 percent of Obamacare enrollees \u2015 received these subsidies this year.\nHealth insurance companies are required by the law to reduce these out-of-pocket costs and to pay the difference to the hospitals, doctors and other medical providers who treat their customers. Then the federal government pays the insurers back.\nThat last part is what Trump controls. No matter what he does, the insurers must lower these costs for their policyholders. But if Trump refuses to pay the companies back, some states would allow them to cancel their customers\u2019 policies and leave the market altogether this year. And the companies that do continue to sell insurance through the exchanges would dramatically hike premiums next year to make up for the lost money. The White House went so far as saying they\u2019d halt the payments next month, but backed down Wednesday.\nPaying this money is not a \u201cbailout.\u201d These health insurance companies didn\u2019t screw up and come to Uncle Sam with their hands out. They entered into contracts with the government to sell certain kinds of health insurance under a certain set of rules, and one of those rules is they\u2019d get the money they\u2019re owed.\nActing in bad faith with a business partner is part of Trump\u2019s modus operandi, but it doesn\u2019t really fly when it\u2019s the federal government doing the reneging. That\u2019s a big reason why a slew of health care and business groups are urging Trump and Congress to stop messing around and pay the money.\nHere\u2019s a partial list of the organizations making this plea: the American Medical Association; the American Hospital Association; the Federation of American Hospitals; America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans; the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association; the American Benefits Council (a group of large businesses); and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\nThe nation\u2019s governors are worried, too. The National Governors Association \u2014 which represents all 50 governors from both political parties \u2014 asked Congress to fix this. It\u2019s not often that every single governor agrees about something, and this is one of those times.\nThe power to blow up the health insurance market is in Trump\u2019s hands because of a lawsuit House Republicans filed against the Obama administration in 2014. Lawmakers argued that Obama was making these cost-sharing reduction payments to insurers in violation of the law, because Congress authorized them, but didn\u2019t approve the specific spending.\nA federal court ruled in favor of House Republicans last year, but allowed the Obama administration to continue making the payments while the case worked its way through appeals. When Trump became president, his administration became the defendant in the case, and along with House Republicans, asked the appeals court to delay proceedings on the lawsuit while the two parties figure out what to do. \nIn the meantime, the money keeps flowing to the insurance companies \u2014 but no one knows for how long, because Trump keeps saying he might cut them off. The result, as Molina Healthcare CEO Mario Molina explained to HuffPost this week, would be millions more uninsured, fewer choices for consumers because some insurers would refuse to sell plans under these circumstances, and much higher premiums for the insurance that remained.\nPut all that together, and it\u2019s the American people who are going to need a bailout.\n Politics hurt too much?
