{"title": "Turkey Interrupts U.S. Air Missions Against ISIS at Major Base", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Turkish authorities on Saturday halted, at least temporarily, all American-led strike missions against the Islamic State that had been flying from the Incirlik air base \u2014 the first major impact of the attempted coup on the broader allied campaign against the terrorist group, United States officials said.\n\u201cThe Turkish government has closed its airspace to military aircraft, and as a result air operations at Incirlik Air Base have been halted at this time,\u201d Peter Cook, the Pentagon press secretary, said in a statement. Mr. Cook said United States officials were \u201cworking with the Turks to resume air operations there as soon as possible.\u201d\nIn the meantime, he said, the American military\u2019s Central Command will alter flight operations in an effort \u201cto minimize any effects on the campaign\u201d against the Islamic State.\nPentagon officials had said late Friday that the unfolding coup had not affected the bombing and surveillance missions from Incirlik. The opening of that base to the allies has enabled commanders to accelerate and intensify airstrikes against Islamic State targets in Iraq and Syria.\nThe potential loss of Incirlik as a staging area and major base, even if temporary, comes at a challenging time for the American-led coalition fighting the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. Local security forces in Iraq and militias in Syria, both supported by the United States, have finally started to gain significant momentum in their air and ground fights against the militants, aided largely by the access to Incirlik.\nDefense Secretary Ashton B. Carter, in particular, had criticized Turkey over the past year for not taking aggressive enough action to tighten its borders and combat the Islamic State. But many of those criticisms from Mr. Carter and other American officials had begun to fade as the campaign against the militants in Iraq and Syria picked up momentum.\nOn Saturday, President Obama received a briefing on the situation in Turkey from senior aides. A White House statement said Mr. Obama \u201cunderscored the shared challenges that will require continued Turkish cooperation, including our joint efforts against terrorism.\u201d\nAt Incirlik, the United States has based A-10 attack planes, KC-135 refueling tankers and surveillance aircraft, including armed drones. The Air Force has said American refueling aircraft at Incirlik handle roughly one-third of refueling operations for the air war over Iraq and Syria.\nUse of the base increased the length of time that American and other allied warplanes could remain over Iraq and Syria. The manned and unmanned strike missions, as well as surveillance missions, from Incirlik \u2014 all hours closer to the fight than aircraft in the Persian Gulf \u2014 have made a big difference. Losing that advantage would significantly hamper operations, American commanders say.\nAt Diyarbakir, another Turkish base, the Air Force began staging small numbers of American troops last fall to recover any downed pilots or flight crews. The Pentagon\u2019s plans to place a mobile rocket system known as Himars, short for High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, somewhere in Turkey to support United States operations in Syria could also be in jeopardy.\nThe Turkish military, which sees itself as the guardian of the secular state, has overthrown or forced out four elected governments since 1960. Turks have long been fascinated by what they call \u201cthe deep state\u201d: a murky group of operatives, linked to the military, thought to have battled perceived enemies of the state since the Cold War.\nBut in a striving Turkey of thriving capitalism and a still boisterous news media, memories of the damage to democracy fomented by past coups remains strong. In the first coup of 1960, the military tried the prime minister and president for treason. The 1980 \u201cSeptember 12 Coup\u201d helped end a period of anarchy and terror, but not before thousands of people were arrested and dozens were executed and tortured.\nAnalysts said the latest coup attempt underlined the extent to which elements within the military had become frustrated by Turkey\u2019s direction under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a religious and conservative Muslim. Mr. Erdogan came to power in 2002, pledging to declaw the once powerful military. He proceeded to impose civilian rule over the state by putting dozens of prominent generals and officers in prison after dramatic show trials for treason, often on tenuous and even fabricated evidence.\nMoreover, Mr. Erdogan, whose government once promised a foreign policy of \u201czero problems with neighbors\u201d has seen conflicts multiply, including 14 attacks on Turkey in the past year by Kurdish and Islamic State militants. He has presided over an increasingly shaky economy, and alienated allies from the United States to Russia. His government has been mired by accusations of corruption.\nAmerican and NATO officials have been pressing to insulate the mission against the Islamic State at Incirlik and other Turkish bases from the internal upheaval. But even if they succeed, Turkish politicians and security forces are likely to be, at the very least, distracted from their counterterrorism focus despite recent vows to redouble efforts after last month\u2019s Istanbul airport bombing.\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to be focused on rooting out coup plotters, and that\u2019s going to preoccupy all the national security services; and everything else, including going after ISIL, will be secondary,\u201d said Eric S. Edelman, a former United States ambassador to Turkey and top Pentagon official under President George W. Bush. \u201cIt may affect their ability to protect themselves from ISIL blowback in Turkey.\u201d\nOne big concern expressed by officials and analysts is that Mr. Erdogan will freeze the cooperation against the Islamic State while he sorts out who in the military supported and carried out the coup attempt. If the Turkish military fractures further \u2014 whether through arrests, forced retirements or other actions \u2014 it could become a weakened partner in the fight against the Islamic State.\n\u201cThis could really effectively eat into the institutional durability of NATO\u2019s second-largest military,\u201d said Soner Cagaptay, a specialist on Turkey at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.\nAykan Erdemir, a former member of Turkey\u2019s Parliament who is now a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington, said the coup reflected the extent to which the Turkish military, a hierarchical top-down organization that controls one of the biggest armies in the region, had become deeply polarized under Mr. Erdogan.\nHe said simmering frustration among some within the officer class, chief among them the coup\u2019s suspected mastermind, Col. Muharrem Kose, had finally boiled over.\nJane Kandur, a member of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s Justice and Development Party\u2019s Istanbul branch, said by phone from Istanbul that the \u201cfailed coup\u201d was \u201can attempt by Gulenists in the military to hold on to power they don\u2019t have the right to have.\u201d She was referring to followers of Fethullah Gulen, a Muslim cleric living in exile in Pennsylvania.\nBut others cautioned that the bloodiness of the coup, including the targeting of civilians, was outside the traditional methods of the Gulen movement, which has typically used the news media, the judiciary and the police to damage opponents.\nDani Rodrik, a prominent economist at Harvard\u2019s John F. Kennedy School of Government, predicted that Mr. Erdogan would use the coup as a pretext to move forward with his ultimate aim of a full presidential system of government in Turkey.\n\u201cThis will do wonders for Erdogan\u2019s cult of personality,\u201d said Mr. Rodrik, whose father-in-law, a retired general in Turkey, was accused of leading a plot to overthrow the government before being freed from prison and acquitted. \u201cIt makes Erdogan\u2019s quest for an authoritarian presidency virtually unstoppable. I fear I will not see a democratic Turkey in my lifetime.\u201d\nWhatever happens, veteran Turkey watchers said they were flabbergasted by the coup attempt, given that Mr. Erdogan appeared to have a near-monopoly on power. Only two months ago, Mr. Erdemir said, he wrote an article declaring that the era of the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in Turkey was over.\n\u201cIt is extremely surprising,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause no one would\u2019ve believed there was a group of officers with the audacity to try and take on Erdogan.\u201d", "date": "July 16, 2016", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/17/world/europe/turkey-us-incirlik-isis.html", "tags": "turkey coup isis \u201c missions military u.s. turkish interrupts state base air erdogan major"}
