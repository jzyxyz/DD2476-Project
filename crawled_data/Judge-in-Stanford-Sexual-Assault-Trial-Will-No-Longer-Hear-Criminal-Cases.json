{"title": "Judge in Stanford Sexual Assault Trial Will No Longer Hear Criminal Cases", "content": "A California judge who came under fire and was the subject of a recall campaign for his sentencing decisions in a Stanford University sexual assault case will be transferred after he asked to be removed from hearing criminal cases.\nThe judge, Aaron Persky, of the Santa Clara County Superior Court, will be moved to the civil division in San Jose, Calif., effective Sept. 6, according to an announcement late Thursday.\n\u201cWhile I firmly believe in Judge Persky\u2019s ability to serve in his current assignment, he has requested to be assigned to the civil division, in which he previously served,\u201d the Santa Clara County Superior Court\u2019s presiding judge, Rise Pichon, said in the announcement, which was obtained from the court on Friday.\n\u201cJudge Persky believes the change will aid the public and the court by reducing the distractions that threaten to interfere with his ability to effectively discharge the duties of his current criminal assignment.\u201d\nIn the sexual assault trial in Palo Alto in June, Judge Persky sentenced Brock Turner, a former Stanford University champion swimmer, to six months in jail and three years\u2019 probation for sexually assaulting an unconscious woman behind a Dumpster after a party.\nThe sentence, and the fact that Mr. Turner would in effect serve only three months, was denounced by victims\u2019 advocates, who called for the judge\u2019s removal from the bench. A petition online calling for impeachment hearings swelled to over 1.2 million signatures, members of Congress read excerpts from the victim\u2019s statement publicly, and lawmakers introduced legislation to strengthen laws against sexual assault.\nMr. Turner, who was found guilty of three felony counts in March, is expected to be released on Sept. 2, a sheriff\u2019s spokesman said. A rally calling for the judge\u2019s removal will be held the same day in San Jose.\nThe announcement of Judge Persky\u2019s transfer came after he recused himself from what would have been another key court decision: He would have had to decide whether to reduce a felony conviction for possession of child pornography to a misdemeanor.\nLast Friday, Judge Persky said in court that while on vacation, he and his family became aware of publicity surrounding the new case, and that the attention had led to a \u201cpersonal family situation\u201d that might have raised doubts about whether he could be impartial, a court document said. No further details were provided.\nJoseph Macaluso, a spokesman for the Superior Court, said Friday that the judge\u2019s recusal and his request for the transfer to civil cases were not related.\nJudge Pichon\u2019s statement, first published in local news media including The San Jose Mercury News, noted that Judge Persky\u2019s quick reassignment was made possible because another judge wanted to relocate to Palo Alto.\nMichele Dauber, a Stanford University law professor who is leading an effort to have voters decide next year whether Judge Persky should remain on the bench, said Friday that the recall effort would continue to publicize and compare his record with that of other judges.\n\u201cMany cases are heard in civil court involving women\u2019s rights \u2014 for example, workplace and educational sexual harassment cases, or students suing their colleges for sexual assault, or victims suing their perpetrators,\u201d Professor Dauber said. \u201cAll of those cases are civil cases, and there is no room for a biased judge in civil court either.\u201d\nRoderick O\u2019Connor, a deputy public defender in Santa Clara County and a supporter of Judge Persky\u2019s, called the transfer a \u201cbig loss.\u201d He said the judge didn\u2019t deserve to be the target of \u201chysteria\u201d because he is extremely prudent and fair, according to The Mercury News.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame he\u2019s moving,\u201d he added, \u201cbecause I believe criminal defendants and prosecutors deserve a judge of Persky\u2019s caliber.\u201d", "date": "Aug. 26, 2016", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/27/us/judge-in-stanford-sexual-assault-trial-will-no-longer-hear-criminal-cases.html", "tags": "stanford longer trial criminal judge court civil \u201d hear sexual cases persky assault"}
