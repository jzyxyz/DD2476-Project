{"title": "Home Is Where the Greek Drama Is", "content": "Depending on how comfortable you are with confrontation, the performance artist and choreographer Ann Liv Young can be a menace or a breath of fresh air. Since arriving on the scene in the early 2000s, she has undergone many physical transformations onstage, yet throughout she has stuck firmly to a belief: Art happens in the moment with an audience.\nShe has taken bites of raw fish and spit them out at the crowd as a deranged mermaid, incorporated a dildo into her version of Snow White and initiated brutally personal and public therapy sessions as her alter-ego Sherry. Yes, Ms. Young presides over a particularly raw, tough kind of art. It can get ugly, and that\u2019s O.K. Art, after all, is about revealing truths.\nFor her latest work, \u201cAntigone,\u201d Ms. Young, 38, is inviting viewers into her private, domestic space, where she is surrounded by children (her two daughters, Lovey, 11, and Akiko, 6) and animals (a kitten, a cat and a dog). Her Bushwick apartment \u2014 and basement and overgrown backyard \u2014 is the backdrop for \u201cAntigone,\u201d which runs May 23 to May 31. On a recent afternoon visit, Ms. Young deemed the place not quite performance ready. Yet just by virtue of her design eye and thrift-shopping prowess, it could easily have been mistaken for a movie set.\nLike all of her shows, \u201cAntigone\u201d will feature a table of merchandise for sale, along with a drinks and food; with special guests and a feedback session, it runs roughly from 6 to 10 p.m. on most nights. Guests include the band the Naysayers, who will perform in the shower. \u201cI guess when somebody needs to use the bathroom,\u201d Ms. Young said, \u201cthey\u2019ll just pull the curtain closed.\u201d\nFor this intimate rendition of \u201cAntigone\u201d \u2014 a larger version has already toured Switzerland and Norway \u2014 Ms. Young, who plays the title role, was inspired by Bertolt Brecht\u2019s 1948 version, with its exploration of social resistance, and Sophocles\u2019 original. In the play, Antigone buries her brother against the wishes of Creon, the King of Thebes, who rules that she must die; her fianc\u00e9, Haemon, fights for her, but it ends in both of their suicides. \nBut Ms. Young\u2019s \u201cAntigone,\u201d like much of her work, also refers to events of her life. Over the past year, things have been rocky: She parted ways with her partner of 14 years, Michael A. Guerrero, who is the father of her children. Her home \u201cAntigone\u201d braids together her imaginative rendering of the characters with her own struggles with a broken relationship.\n\u201cI do think it\u2019s important to know that it\u2019s so hard,\u201d she said. \u201cHow do you deal with this? How do you break up with someone? It\u2019s all depressing, isn\u2019t it? It is. That\u2019s why I have to have kittens around.\u201d \nMs. Young has long included Lovey in her work. She was originally meant to play Antigone, but after her parents separated it was decided that she should concentrate on school. In Bushwick, she will play the chorus on select nights. (Look for her sister, Akiko, as the shadow of the chorus.)\nThe specifics of Lovey\u2019s role are up for discussion. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to change on different nights,\u201d she said one morning before school. One idea she had was to watch \u201cHarry Potter\u201d movies in bed in character. \u201cI was just kind of joking around, but my mom was like, \u2018Oh, that is actually a good idea,\u2019\u201d Lovey said. \u201cAnd then she decided on doing it.\u201d\nMs. Young said she was also going to try a night of live-directing Lovey as Antigone. \u201cJust to have her try on the role,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had so much fun getting ready for this. I spent six months working with her. I think it\u2019s fascinating to have someone so young in a role so intense.\u201d\nShe\u2019s already thinking about her next choreographic move \u2014 and it\u2019s one that would involve more young people: a version of Anne Frank featuring only children.\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s because I have kids, and I see the stuff that people propose to them,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m like, what is wrong with you? They\u2019re not stupid. They can deal with heavy material. I just think, Gosh, maybe if we had them working on really intense layered things they wouldn\u2019t be so glued to the iPad.\u201d\nArt is life, and life is art. Ms. Young spoke about both recently at her Bushwick home. What follows are edited excerpts from our conversation.\nYou said that this show is not super choreographed like your last major piece, \u201cElektra,\u201d was. How would you describe it?\nIt\u2019s very hypnotic. It\u2019s very abstract. I was on my migraine med, like 75 milligrams a night, when I made this show, and I think you can a little bit feel that. Migraine meds are anti-depressants.\nHow did that affect it?\nYou cannot focus on many things at once. You have to zone in on one thing, and this is not good for me. I have to be able to see the whole picture and make choices, and so this show feels a bit like that: It feels a bit like zoning in on one thing and then stretching it out.\n Who is your Antigone?\n[Sighs] Originally, I think I was like, oh, another strong female Greek blah blah blah. But then I had all these weird visions of a courtroom, and that was really weird to me. I would dream of a courtroom, and then I\u2019m literally in court three times a month since I broke up with Michael. I think if there is any role that I feel the closest to it\u2019s probably this one.\nHow?\nWhat I\u2019ve ended up trying to do with this show is taking the scraps that have been left from this breakup and using those scraps to make something. It\u2019s like \u201cAntigone\u201d is the remnants after a war.\nHow do you feel about performing with your kids?\nIt feels a little weird in this space, but I think what we\u2019re doing to it is going to be super beautiful. I love performing with them.\nWhy did you want to host this piece in your home? \nI\u2019ve always been really into the idea of opening your home. What does it mean to be hospitable? It\u2019s nice to take something that\u2019s so expansive and needs so much room and crunch it into a tiny space. \nWhat else?\nI also like the idea that this place can\u2019t fit so many people. It has to be quite intimate, and I think that\u2019s quite good for this particular show because people are held more accountable. You can hide less. And being here, it feels almost like opening a wound.\nHow so?\nIt feels very vulnerable, like: here, come \u2014 I\u2019m going to open this very painful process to you. It\u2019s like letting people step on a sore. I don\u2019t know why I don\u2019t have issues with that. I think that\u2019s part of my problem. [Laughs]\nWhat does that give you back?\nI\u2019m a firm believer in \u201cmake something with what you have.\u201d I always have been, and in some ways I wish I wasn\u2019t like that.\nI\u2019m not really interested in prestige or money. I just want to make stuff that I feel like needs to be made. I want to ask difficult questions. I think art is the place to pose questions. Are we aspiring to make things that just make people feel O.K.? So people can just go in there and sit and be like, this is neither here nor there? That\u2019s what it seems people want.\nAnd it\u2019s not what you do.\nNo. And I will never.
