On Monday, Parliament must create both,\" he said.\nThe ADS Group, which represents the aerospace and defence sectors, said that if there was not sufficient support for Theresa May's deal, the UK should \"pause and reset the process\".\nADS chief executive Paul Everitt said: \"It is for government and Parliament to decide the way forward, but the voice of UK businesses, their employees, customers and suppliers must be given greater priority.\"\nSmall business representatives also reacted with dismay to the political deadlock over Brexit.\nThe national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, Mike Cherry, said: \"Our small firms are sick and tired of politicians debating and dithering over Brexit. They are trying to get on with their jobs and it's time that politicians get on and do the same.\"", "date": "29 March 2019", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-47753125", "tags": "brexit \u2018 uk business parliament chief mps must executive devastated vote businesses"}
