{"title": "You Can Now Learn High Valyrian From 'Game Of Thrones' On Duolingo", "content": "The latest course from Duolingo might even make Hodor want to take on a few more vocabulary words.\u00a0\nJust in time for Season 7 of \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d the language learning app is unveiling a new course where you can learn to speak the \u201cGoT\u201d\u00a0language High Valyrian for free.\nIt\u2019s out now. You can seriously just go hop on your dragon and Learn High Valyrian.\u00a0\nThe course, which is now available in beta, comes from \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d language creator David J. Peterson as well as three fans,\u00a0Justin Mansfield, Nicol\u00e1s Campi and Amorena Nobile.\u00a0\nBy the end of the course, Peterson told us, \u201cYou will be able to produce and understand some of the more famous lines like \u2018a dragon is not a slave\u2019 and a lot of Daenerys\u2019 titles.\u201d\n\u201cNot all of them, but a lot,\u201d Peterson added with a laugh.\n(Khaleesi has a lot of titles.)\n\u201cOther than that, it\u2019s just going to be a language course. You\u2019re going to learn a number of verbs, a whole bunch of nouns, and be able to put them into sentences,\u201d he said. \u201cA fun thing we do, at the end of the course, I put in a bunch of the names of people and the names of places that are of interest to that particular region of Essos.\u201d\nThough Peterson wasn\u2019t asked to create High Valyrian until Season 3, he told us he actually started after the pilot because he saw the fans really wanted it. The linguist said he broke into it with author George R.R. Martin\u2019s phrases \u201cvalar morghulis\u201d (\u201call men must die\u201d) and \u201cvalar dohaeris\u201d (\u201call men must serve\u201d), which helped develop\u00a0\u201cthe number system and entire verbal system.\u201d\nIf you\u2019re taking on the language, you\u2019ll be happy to hear High Valyrian has no articles to trip you up.\n\u201cI hate articles. It\u2019s just a mess,\u201d said Peterson, \u201cThey\u2019re so stupid. They\u2019re so small.\u201d\nAlso, High Valyrian has four genders:\u00a0lunar, solar, terrestrial and aquatic.\n\u201cThere are lots of languages where the gender of nouns happens to coincide with biological sex, and now we use the term sex and gender almost interchangeably in English. There\u2019s a lot of confusion about that, but it\u2019s not the case that gender has to be tied to biological sex,\u201d said Peterson.\nWe\u2019d love to talk more about High Valyrian, but winter is coming, so if you want your Valyrian ready for the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d premiere, you better get started.\u00a0", "date": "\n07/13/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/you-can-now-learn-high-valyrian-from-game-of-thrones-on-duolingo_n_59676059e4b0a0c6f1e6345f", "tags": "valyrian language game course high learn \u201d lot peterson thrones duolingo"}
