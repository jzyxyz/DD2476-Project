{"title": "Amazon, eBay Remove 'Chinese Boy' Costumes Featuring Racist 'Slant-Eye' Images", "content": "It\u2019s 2018, and yet... here we are.\nAmazon UK and eBay UK have received immense backlash after social media users recently noticed\u00a0\u201cChinese Boy Fancy Dress Costumes\u201d\u00a0for sale through the e-commerce sites. In photos on the product pages, the costumes were modeled by white children pulling their eyes back in a \u201cslant-eye\u201d expression, a gesture often used to mock Asians.\nThe images spurred many in the Asian community to report the merchandise and demand its removal from the sites.\nThe sellers of the costumes were listed on Amazon as \u201cATOSA\u201d and \u201cFyasa.\u201d No information was immediately available about either entity, although sellers\u00a0with those names appear to sell many other Halloween costumes through Amazon.\n\u201cOnce this listing was brought to our attention, we immediately removed the item and contacted the seller informing them that the listing violates eBay\u2019s offensive materials policy,\u201d eBay told HuffPost in a statement Tuesday.\nAmazon appeared to have removed the offending products as well. \u201cThe products in question are no longer available,\u201d Amazon told HuffPost in a statement.\nBoth Amazon and eBay, however, still feature several other racist costumes, including a different \u201cChinese Boy Fancy Dress\u201d costume and a \u201cGeisha Girl\u201d costume.\u00a0In the photos for both products, the models are holding their hands together in prayer, a stereotypical gesture often employed to mock Asians.\nAmazon and eBay have received criticism in the past for offensive merchandise sold through their sites. Earlier this month, Amazon pulled a variety of laptops, baby bibs and other products featuring the words \u201cSlavery Gets Shit Done.\u201d The two companies also came under fire in 2015 for selling an\u00a0Israeli soldier\u2019s Halloween costume for kids, as well as an \u201cArab\u201d nose.\nThis story has been updated with a statement from Amazon.", "date": "\n01/30/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/amazon-ebay-racist-asian-costumes_n_5a70cffae4b0ae29f08bafb7", "tags": "boy uk costume remove images featuring \u201d ebay racist sites products statement costumes amazon"}
