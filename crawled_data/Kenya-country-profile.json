{"title": "Kenya country profile", "content": "Situated on the equator on Africa's east coast, Kenya has been described as \"the cradle of humanity\".\nIn the Great Rift Valley palaeontologists have discovered some of the earliest evidence of man's ancestors.\nIn the present day, Kenya's ethnic diversity has produced a vibrant culture but is also a source of conflict.\nThe Islamist militant Al-Shabab movement, active in Somalia, has also been launching a growing number of attacks in Kenya, including the 2013 Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi and the 2015 attack on Garissa University College in northwest Kenya.\nOther pressing challenges include high unemployment, crime and poverty. Droughts frequently put millions of people at risk.\nPresident: Uhuru Kenyatta\nThe son of Kenya's founding president, Uhuru Kenyatta took up his father's mantle to become head of state in April 2013, despite facing charges of crimes against humanity over election violence five years earlier.\nMr Kenyatta, ranked by Forbes as the richest man in Kenya, was born in 1961 shortly after the release of his father Jomo Kenyatta from nearly 10 years' imprisonment by British colonial forces, and two years before Kenya's independence.\nEducated in the United States at the elite Amherst College, where he studied political science and economics, he is viewed as the top political leader of Kenya's largest tribe, the Kikuyu, who make up some 17% of the population.\nHowever, he also appeals to Kenyans from different ethnic backgrounds, able to mingle not only with the elite he was born into but also with the average Kenyan, cracking jokes using local street slang.\nHe was declared winner of the presidential election in August 2017, but the Supreme Court declared the election null and void because of irregularities. He was also declared winner of the October re-run, which was boycotted by the opposition. \nA handful of major commercial companies dominates the media industry, operating alongside state-owned Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC).\nTV is the main news source in urban areas.
