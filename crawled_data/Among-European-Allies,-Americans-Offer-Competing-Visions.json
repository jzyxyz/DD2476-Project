{"title": "Among European Allies, Americans Offer Competing Visions", "content": "MUNICH \u2014 Vice President Mike Pence made his case for \u201cAmerica First\u201d in the deeply hostile territory of an annual conference of America\u2019s closest European allies on Saturday. He was not deterred from repeating his demands that Europe withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement, ban Chinese gear from global communications networks and accelerate its increases in contributions to NATO.\nMr. Pence received a predictably tepid response, mainly from a crowd of visiting Americans. They included a number of Republican members of Congress who came here to Munich, along with the Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, at a fraught moment in the trans-Atlantic relationship.\nHours later, Mr. Pence\u2019s predecessor, Joseph R. Biden, received a brief standing ovation after delivering an impassioned rebuttal to the Trump administration\u2019s treatment of allies, in what appeared to be the foreign policy plank of a campaign for president \u2014 if he decides to run.\n\u201cI promise you, I promise you,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Biden said. \u201cThis too shall pass. We will be back. We will be back.\u201d He never defined \u201cwe.\u201d\nTaken together, the two men defined the dramatic change in American foreign policy that has left the traditional allies who gather at the Munich Security Conference in despair, and has led the Trump administration to embrace newer, far more authoritarian allies in Central Europe. Mr. Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spent the week visiting several of them, in a European tour that bore little resemblance to similar trips taken by administrations past.\n\u201cThe contrast is between a new foreign policy that focuses on America first and expects others to do as we say no matter what,\u201d said Ivo Daalder, a former American ambassador to NATO and now the president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, \u201cand the old foreign policy of working together in pursuit of common values.\u2019\u2019\nMr. Pence did acknowledge significant progress in getting more NATO members to live up to their commitment to contribute 2 percent of their gross domestic product to defense by 2024. Even the current secretary general of the NATO alliance, Jens Stoltenberg of Norway, said on Saturday that \u201cEuropean allies are stepping up more for defense.\u201d\nBut Mr. Pence went further.\nHe repeated a call that he made in Warsaw on Thursday, during an American-led conference of foreign ministers chiefly from Arab and European states, that Britain, France and Germany withdraw from the 2015 nuclear accord with Iran.\nIt was a demand they had no intention of complying with, as Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany made clear in an impassioned defense of alliances and Europe\u2019s approach to Iran that preceded Mr. Pence\u2019s speech by only moments.\nMr. Pence, fresh from a visit Friday to the Auschwitz concentration camp, accused Iran of seeking another Holocaust, citing speeches from Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran\u2019s supreme leader.\nHe moved on to demands for other steps to wall off Europe from adversaries, insisting that the allies forgo any purchases of Russian arms, or the installation of advanced 5G communications networks made by Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant.\n\u201cWe cannot ensure the defense of the West,\u201d Mr. Pence said, \u201cif our allies grow dependent on the East.\u201d\nThe Munich conference has over the decades come to represent the alliance establishment; for years the American delegation was led by the late Senator John McCain of Arizona. (Mr. Pence spoke at a dinner in Mr. McCain\u2019s memory on Friday night.)\nOver the years, Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, has come to argue with the allies, and Mr. Pence was followed by one of the most influential officials in the Chinese foreign policy hierarchy, Yang Jiechi. He spent some of his time talking about the United Nations and climate change, perhaps betting that Mr. Pence would mention neither. (He was right.)\nMr. Yang pushed back against Mr. Pence, who had left the auditorium before the Communist Party leader spoke, declaring that \u201cChina doesn\u2019t require companies to install a backdoor or to collect intelligence.\u201d But he never addressed the new Chinese law that would require companies like Huawei to assist Chinese intelligence agencies in any investigations.\nMr. Biden seemed to side with the organizers of the conference, who opened it with the release of a report titled, \u201cWho Will Pick Up The Pieces?\u201d It focused on a rapidly restructuring world order, and the anxiety among America\u2019s allies that the Trump administration\u2019s erratic leadership is a threat to their own security.\nMr. Biden picked up on that theme but also tried to stake out a tougher line on Russia than the Trump administration has. He condemned Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election, a topic Mr. Pence did not address.\n\u201cI\u2019m not concerned about Russian influence in Europe alone,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Biden said. \u201cI\u2019m concerned about Russian influence in America.\u201d\nHe noted the Obama administration\u2019s sanctions against Russia at the end of its term, without mentioning the widespread sense among his former administration colleagues that, in retrospect, their actions were far too little and too late.\nBut Mr. Biden also warned against nostalgia and laid out his own challenge for NATO \u2014 that it must modernize to deal with new threats, starting with cyberattacks and information warfare. NATO is arguably a decade or more behind in the cyber arena. While it had a long-established playbook to deal with traditional armed invasions and even nuclear conflict, it only recently began discussing an offensive cyberstrategy.\nWith steady message control, Mr. Pence used every stop on his European visit to reinforce the administration\u2019s message that Iran needed to be confronted and Western allies needed to get in line.\nLeaving Auschwitz on Friday, he told reporters aboard his plane to Munich that the trip to the concentration camp had only enforced his belief that the Trump administration should stay heavily aligned with Israel and to \u201cstand strong\u201d against Iran.\n\u201cThe lesson of the 20th century is that when authoritarian leaders breathe out anti-Semitic threats of violence against the Jewish people,\u201d Mr. Pence said, \u201cfreedom-loving people should take them seriously and be prepared to confront them.\u201d\nIn Munich, he turned briefly to negotiations to resolve a damaging trade war with China, saying that a true solution was contingent on a host of related issues, including the theft of intellectual property and free navigation in the South China Sea.\n\u201cPresident Trump has great respect for President Xi, and so do I,\u201d Mr. Pence said, but added, \u201cBeijing knows where we stand.\u201d\nOne curious result of the competing messages from Mr. Pence and Mr. Biden is that Ms. Merkel, in her last years in office, has emerged again as the biggest defender of the traditional order. She received a standing ovation when she was asked by the conference\u2019s organizers who would pick up the pieces.\n\u201cOnly all of us together,\u201d Ms. Merkel replied, to a round of applause.", "date": "Feb. 16, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/16/world/europe/mike-pence-joe-biden.html", "tags": "allies european competing administration iran biden \u201c munich pence offer visions americans among"}
