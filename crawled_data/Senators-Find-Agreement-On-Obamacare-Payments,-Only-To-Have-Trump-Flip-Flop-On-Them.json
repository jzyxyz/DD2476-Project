{"title": "Senators Find Agreement On Obamacare Payments, Only To Have Trump Flip-Flop On Them", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2015 Republican and Democratic senators on Tuesday afternoon announced they had reached an agreement on how to stabilize the Affordable Care Act\u2019s private insurance markets, offering hope that bipartisan action on \u201cObamacare\u201d might actually be possible.\nBut those hopes seemed dimmer by the evening, when President Donald Trump, who had praised the deal just hours before, called it a \u201cbailout for insurance companies\u201d\u00a0\u2015 a sentiment he repeated\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0morning on\u00a0Twitter.\nThe bipartisan agreement would fund the so-called\u00a0Cost Sharing Reductions, which reimburse insurers for the cost of special, more generous plans they offer exclusively to low-income customers. Trump announced last week that he planned to stop those subsidy payments, which have been the subject of an ongoing legal dispute, in an effort to further dismantle Obamacare.\nBut rather than blow up the law, the president\u2019s move seemed to reignite negotiations between the ranking members of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee,\u00a0Republican Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Democrat Patty Murray of Washington. For weeks, the two had discussed ways of funding the CSR payments while giving states more flexibility on the plans they offer.\n\u201cThis takes care of the next two years,\u201d Alexander, the committee\u2019s chairman, told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cAfter that, we can have a full-fledged debate on where we go long-term on health care.\u201d\nAlexander was careful to point out the proposal\u2019s relatively narrow scope:\u00a0\u201cI\u2019d like to undersell it, not oversell it.\u201d But it is expected to get significant support from Democrats. Alexander said he and Murray were now working to get cosponsors from both sides of the aisle and to present Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) with a bill by the end of the week.\nWhile the actual deal itself is still being finalized, Alexander\u2019s description was that, in exchange for funding the payments to insurers, the agreement would amend the authority of the Department of Health and Human Services to accept more state applications to waive certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act. \nThe changes, according to Senate aides, would allow HHS to approve waiver requests more quickly, speeding up a process that state officials have frequently decried as too slow. The agreement would also allow governors to seek waivers on their own authorities rather than seeking acts of state legislatures. \nThe changes would also clear the way for insurers to offer policies with higher deductibles and out-of-pocket costs than the law allows today \u2015 effectively adding a layer of \u201ccopper\u201d plans that would be less generous than the minimal \u201cbronze\u201d plans now on the market. The theory is that such plans would have lower premiums and would give individuals the option of more \u201ccatastrophic coverage\u201d insurance.\nAlexander got language allowing states to show their waiver requests will achieve \u201ccomparative affordability,\u201d which basically means they would have more leeway over who ends up with what kind of insurance. Murray signed off on this, Senate aides said, but only after Alexander agreed to additional language protecting low-income consumers, people with serious medical problems and other \u201cvulnerable\u201d populations.\nAs a carrot to Democrats, the deal adds more than $100 million in outreach funding to promote ACA signups, basically replacing the money that the Trump administration has cut, and it would authorize new spending to finance reinsurance programs, which help reduce premiums by reimbursing insurers for some of the costs associated with their most expensive beneficiaries. (Congress would still have to appropriate that money separately.)\nAlexander made it clear that other key protections in the Affordable Care Act, including a requirement that all plans cover \u201cessential health benefits\u201d \u2015 including maternity care, prescription drugs and hospitalization \u2015 would remain in place. So would the prohibition on denying coverage or charging higher premiums to people with pre-existing conditions.\n\u201cBut it does give states significant new flexibility in terms of offering policies,\u201d Alexander said.\nWhen McConnell was asked about the tentative deal \u2015 whether it was a \u201ctacit endorsement\u201d of Obamacare \u2015 he said Republicans hadn\u2019t had a chance to think about the way forward yet and he referred questions to Alexander and Murray.\nTrump was less circumspect \u2015 and also less consistent.\nEarly in the day, Trump suggested that Obamacare was \u201cvirtually dead\u201d \u2015 \u201cas far as I\u2019m concerned, it really is dead\u201d \u2015 and he bashed the CSR payments as money that \u201cgoes to the insurance companies to line their pockets.\u201d\nThese statements were consistent with what Trump said on Monday,\u00a0when he was emphatic that Obamacare was \u201cfinished.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s dead. It\u2019s gone. You shouldn\u2019t even mention it. It\u2019s gone. There is no such thing as Obamacare anymore,\u201d Trump said in the Rose Garden.\nBut later on Tuesday,\u00a0Trump said the White House was involved in the negotiations with Alexander and Murray and he suggested that he could support the deal.\n\u201cBut it is a short-term solution so that we don\u2019t have this very dangerous little period, including dangerous period for insurance companies, by the way, for a period of one year, two years, we will have a very good solution,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut we are going to have a great solution, ultimately, for health care, okay? But they are working together. And I know very much what they\u2019re doing, okay?\u201d\n\u201cIt will get us over the intermediate hump,\u201d Trump said.\nBy Tuesday evening, Trump seemed less enthusiastic, praising the bipartisan effort but criticizing the agreement itself. \u201cI\u2019m pleased the Democrats have finally responded to my call for them to take responsibility for their Obamacare disaster and work with Republicans to provide much-needed relief to the American people,\u201d Trump said during a speech at the Heritage Foundation.\n\u201cWhile I commend the bipartisan work done by Senators Alexander and Murray \u2015 and I do commend it \u2015 I continue to believe Congress must find a solution to the Obamacare mess instead of providing bailouts to insurance companies,\u201d Trump said.\nThen, the next morning, he tweeted out the same thoughts.\nIt\u2019s not clear how, if at all, this deal would affect plans and options for next year, given that open enrollment is set to begin in less than three weeks. Many carriers raised their rates preemptively for 2018, in case Trump cut off the insurer payments, while others are scrambling to do so now.\nIf the insurers get the payments after all, because some version of the Alexander-Murray agreement becomes law, the carriers will end up with extra money. There are ways to avoid that \u2015 like having the insurers give consumers rebates, or somehow finding a way to let them bring premiums back down. Senators said they were aware of the problem and working on ways to make sure insurers don\u2019t \u201cdouble dip\u201d, as\u00a0Schumer\u00a0put it, although they gave no details about what ideas were under discussion.\nIt\u2019s also still unclear whether the agreement has enough support in Congress. As Alexander said Tuesday, he and Murray were working now to build bipartisan support. It seems likely that, in the Senate, nearly all Democrats would vote for the deal, as would a number of Republicans.\nWhen HuffPost asked GOP lawmakers about CSR payments on Tuesday, rank-and-file Republicans sounded supportive of doing something to ensure that premiums were workable.\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably a good idea for Congress to step in and at least address that part of the issue,\u201d Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) told HuffPost.\nKansas Republican Sen. Pat Roberts said anything lawmakers could do on health care to provide some relief would be a positive step.\u00a0Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wy.) said he had encouraged Alexander to work with Murray toward an agreement. And Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), one of the three Republicans who was steadfast in her opposition to repealing Obamacare, said she was \u201cvery optimistic\u201d about a bipartisan deal.\nThe big questions now are whether McConnell will bring the deal to the floor in the Senate, and whether House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) would do the same in the House.\nThe speaker\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nDemocrats could insist on passage of the CSR payments on a number of upcoming must-pass bills, including a government funding measure in December.\nBut the deal ultimately hinges on Trump. It\u2019s hard to imagine Senate or House Republicans \u2015 particularly McConnell or Ryan \u2015 standing up to Trump on not passing a CSR bill, particularly because so few GOP lawmakers will be needed to get such a bill over the finish line.\nAnd after Tuesday, counting on Trump\u2019s support for the proposal would seem like a foolish bet.\nThis article has been updated to include additional information about the Alexander-Murray deal and Trump\u2019s comments on Tuesday evening, as well as a tweet from Trump on Wednesday.", "date": "\n10/17/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/senate-alexander-murray-csr-trump_n_59e653ace4b00905bdad14b3?enp", "tags": "agreement flip-flop find obamacare deal senators would \u201d trump \u2015 alexander tuesday payments"}
