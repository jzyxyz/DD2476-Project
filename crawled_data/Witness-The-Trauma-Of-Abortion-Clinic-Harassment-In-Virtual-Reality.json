{"title": "Witness The Trauma Of Abortion Clinic Harassment In Virtual Reality", "content": "As abortion access continues to come under threat in Congress, women who are trying to access the procedure are regularly confronted with anti-abortion harassment and vitriol outside of clinics nationwide. Planned Parenthood\u2019s new virtual reality video, \u201cAcross the Line,\u201d aims to show just how intense that experience can be.\u00a0\nThe 8-minute video opens with a patient meeting her doctor, and recovering from the harassment she was victim to on the sidewalk.\u00a0\nThe video uses VR and CGI animation to show what the experience of being harassed is like from the patient\u2019s perspective. On her way into the building, she hears misogynist insults and manipulative and inaccurate medical information about why she should carry her pregnancy to term.\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry you had to go through that,\u201d her doctor says.\u00a0\n(Watch the video below.)\nIn the video, strangers hurl taunts like, \u201cwhore\u201d and \u201cstart closing your legs\u201d at the patient. While it might sound like an extreme example,\u00a0it sadly is not. \u00a0\nPlanned Parenthood worked as an Executive Producer on the video, representatives of the women\u2019s health care organization were consulted on the script, and much of the audio was taken from actual recordings outside of various clinics across the country.\nHuffPost also talked to three clinic escort volunteers who said that the video is indeed true to the lived experience \u2015 and, if anything, it\u2019s actually a more watered-down version for some.\u00a0\nPearl Brady, a volunteer clinic escort in Jamaica, Queens told HuffPost that she actually felt the video was \u201cfairly tame\u201d compared to what she sees.\u00a0\n\u201cProtesters don\u2019t just yell abhorrent things at people; they surround people and engulf them as they walk down the sidewalk,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the video, you don\u2019t see the huge posters with Photoshopped mangled fetuses that protesters will shove in people\u2019s faces and use to block their path. You don\u2019t see how intimidating it can be to people to have protesters lining both sides of the sidewalk yelling obscene things at you from every direction. You don\u2019t see how the protesters will prey upon anyone who looks the slightest bit uncomfortable or upset and will do everything they can to bring people to tears.\u201d\nMichelle Davis, another clinic escort volunteer based in Columbus, Oh., had a similar opinion of the video.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard many of the exact same things said to patients and staff at the clinic where I am a patient escort in Columbus,\u201d she told HuffPost. \u201cPeople who work at clinics are often desensitized to this violent hate speech, this video does a good job of highlighting the patient perspective and how truly terrifying that can be.\u201d\nKelli Jordan, a clinic escort in Charlotte, N.C., where abortion clinics face regular protests, said that \u201cAcross the Line\u201d\u00a0resonated deeply with her because of its portrayal of anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers trying to lure patients away from the clinic. Protestors will often get patients to pull over and try to talk them out of going inside the clinic.\u00a0\n\u201cMost protesters offer free pregnancy tests or ultrasounds to patients,\u201d Jordan said.\nAnd being approached by so many angry strangers can be an overwhelming experience.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a majority of what we observe [patients]\u00a0feel when I talk to [them]\u00a0entering the clinic,\u201d Jordan told HuffPost. \u201cThey\u2019re anxious and nervous.\u201d\u00a0\nHead over to the \u201cAcross the Line\u201d website for more information about the project.\u00a0", "date": "\n05/24/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/witness-the-trauma-of-abortion-clinic-harassment-in-virtual-reality_n_59258870e4b0650cc020a068", "tags": "reality harassment clinic virtual \u201d trauma escort protesters abortion patient patients video witness"}
