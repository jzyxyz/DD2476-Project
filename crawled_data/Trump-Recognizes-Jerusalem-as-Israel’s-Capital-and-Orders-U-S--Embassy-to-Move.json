{"title": "Trump Recognizes Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s Capital and Orders U.S. Embassy to Move", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump on Wednesday formally recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, reversing nearly seven decades of American foreign policy and setting in motion a plan to move the United States Embassy from Tel Aviv to the fiercely contested Holy City.\n\u201cToday we finally acknowledge the obvious: that Jerusalem is Israel\u2019s capital,\u201d Mr. Trump said from the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House. \u201cThis is nothing more or less than a recognition of reality. It is also the right thing to do. It\u2019s something that has to be done.\u201d\nThe president cast his decision as a break with decades of failed policy on Jerusalem, which the United States, along with virtually every other nation in the world, has declined to recognize as the capital since Israel\u2019s founding in 1948. That policy, he said, brought us \u201cno closer to a lasting peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.\u201d\n\u201cIt would be folly to assume that repeating the exact same formula would now produce a different or better result,\u201d Mr. Trump declared.\nRecognizing Jerusalem, he added, was \u201ca long overdue step to advance the peace process.\u201d\nMr. Trump\u2019s remarks were the most closely scrutinized of his presidency on the Middle East, where he has vowed to broker the \u201cultimate deal\u201d between Israelis and Palestinians but has yet to find a breakthrough to end the conflict. He said he remained committed to brokering an agreement \u201cthat is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians.\u201d\nThe president said the decision to recognize Jerusalem should not be construed as the United States taking a position on whether, or how, the city might ultimately be shared. But he offered little solace to the Palestinians, making no mention of their long-held hopes for East Jerusalem to be the capital of a Palestinian state.\nInstead, Mr. Trump emphasized the domestic political dimension of the decision. He noted that he had promised to move the embassy during the 2016 presidential campaign, and added, \u201cWhile previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver. Today, I am delivering.\u201d\nThough he did not mention it, Mr. Trump signed the same national security waiver signed by his predecessors, from Barack Obama to George W. Bush to Bill Clinton, which will allow the administration to keep the embassy in Tel Aviv for an additional six months. White House officials said that was unavoidable because it would take several years to move the embassy staff to a new facility in Jerusalem.\n\u201cThere will of course, be disagreement and dissent regarding this announcement,\u201d the president said. He appealed for \u201ccalm, for moderation, and for the voices of tolerance to prevail over the purveyors of hate.\u201d\nMr. Trump\u2019s recognition of Jerusalem isolates the United States on one of the world\u2019s most sensitive diplomatic issues. It has drawn a storm of criticism from Arab and European leaders, which swelled on Tuesday night after the White House confirmed Mr. Trump\u2019s plans.\nPope Francis and the Chinese foreign ministry joined the chorus of voices warning that the move could unleash a wave of violence across the region. At a meeting in Brussels, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson was sternly reproached by European allies.\nStanding next to Mr. Tillerson, the European Union\u2019s top diplomat, Federica Mogherini, made clear that Europe saw the president\u2019s decision as a threat to peace in the Middle East.\n\u201cWe believe that any action that would undermine these efforts must absolutely be avoided,\u201d she said. \u201cA way must be found through negotiations to resolve the status of Jerusalem as a future capital of both states.\u201d\nJust hours before Mr. Trump made his announcement, Mr. Tillerson said that peace in the Middle East was still possible.\nMr. Tillerson, during a news conference at NATO headquarters in the heart of Europe, expressed reassurances about the expected consequences of the decision.\n\u201cThe president\u2019s very committed to the Middle East peace process,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said.\nMr. Tillerson has been largely shut out of the usual back-and-forth between Israelis and Palestinians that many secretaries of state spent much of their tenures conducting. Instead, Mr. Trump entrusted that task to his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner.\nAt least one former Obama administration official also weighed in with sharp criticism. John O. Brennan, the former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, said in a statement that Mr. Trump\u2019s action was \u201creckless\u201d and would \u201cdamage U.S. interests in the Middle East for years to come and will make the region more volatile.\u201d\nAdministration officials said they expected the blowback from the Palestinians and others, but they asserted that the move would accelerate, not hinder, the peace process.\nMr. Trump\u2019s promise to move the embassy appealed to evangelical voters and pro-Israel American Jews, including Sheldon Adelson, the Las Vegas casino magnate. By delivering on that promise, Mr. Trump\u2019s aides said, he was enhancing his credibility as a peacemaker.\nThe announcement, officials said, was recognition of current and historic reality. West Jerusalem is the seat of Israel\u2019s government, and recognizing it as such would remove ambiguity from the American position, they said.\nJerusalem is one of the world\u2019s most fiercely contested swaths of real estate, with each side disputing the other\u2019s claims. Palestinians view East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state, and most of the world considers it occupied territory. Jerusalem\u2019s Old City has the third-holiest mosque in Islam and the holiest site in Judaism, making the city\u2019s status a sensitive issue for Muslims and Jews alike. Jerusalem is also sacred ground to Christians.\nIn addition to declining to take a position on the ultimate shape of Jerusalem, Mr. Trump called for the status quo on a disputed area of the Old City, known as the Temple Mount to Jews and the Noble Sanctuary to Muslims, which has been a flash point for tensions.\nMr. Kushner and Jason D. Greenblatt, the president\u2019s special envoy, have been working for months to prepare for a negotiation between Israelis and Palestinians. Though they have little to show for the effort publicly, they say they have made progress behind the scenes.\nThose efforts, Middle East experts said, would be jeopardized by Wednesday\u2019s announcement. But Mr. Kushner and Mr. Greenblatt, the president\u2019s special envoy, supported the president\u2019s move, officials said.", "date": "Dec. 6, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/world/middleeast/trump-jerusalem-israel-capital.html", "tags": "u.s. president recognizes israel trump embassy capital move \u201d orders jerusalem said east"}
