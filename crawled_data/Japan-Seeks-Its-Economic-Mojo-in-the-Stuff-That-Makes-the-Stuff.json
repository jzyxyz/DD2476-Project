{"title": "Japan Seeks Its Economic Mojo in the Stuff That Makes the Stuff", "content": "TOKYO \u2014 There is absolutely nothing sexy about bellows. But they just might be the future of Japan.\nThe cylindrical metal products made by Irie Koken Company more resemble Slinkys on steroids than the gee-whiz gadgetry for which Japan was once famous, like Sony\u2019s Walkman, Nintendo\u2019s Game Boy and Toyota\u2019s Prius. But they perform the crucial if underappreciated task of helping makers of semiconductors and LCD panels keep their products clean and working.\n\u201cThe technology used in making these products is very difficult,\u201d said Norihiro Irie, Irie Koken\u2019s president. \u201cNot many companies are able to do it.\u201d\nSome economists and businesspeople believe that slow-growth Japan may be forging a new, critical role in the global economy: making the stuff that makes the stuff for today\u2019s digital revolution. Japan has become an essential supplier of robotics that power assembly lines; electronic systems for cars; circuit boards, sensors and other parts in your smartphone; and a host of other technical components and hardware hidden from the consumer\u2019s eye.\nJapan is moving toward \u201can entirely different strategy, where other countries cannot compete,\u201d said Ryoji Musha, president of the economic analysis outfit Musha Research in Tokyo. \u201cGoing forward, Japan will show a remarkable emergence as one of the locomotives of the global economy.\u201d\nThat would be good news for everyone. Japan remains the world\u2019s third-largest economy, behind only the United States and China. A stronger Japan would offer a badly needed pillar to support global growth and serve as a counterweight to rising Chinese political and economic clout.\nBellows and the many other Japanese products like them have already helped buoy the country\u2019s growth. Over the past two years, the economy has experienced the longest continuous expansion since the 1980s. Last year\u2019s 1.7 percent growth rate was the fastest since 2013.\nSustaining it won\u2019t be easy. Japanese companies will have to strive to keep their quality edge over low-cost China, which has caught up with Japan in making things like televisions and appliances, as well as over rivals including the United States, South Korea and Taiwan. Japan\u2019s image on quality has been hit recently by a number of scandals.\nMore broadly, Japanese society is still shrinking, aging and deeply skeptical of immigrants. That will make it difficult for companies to find enough skilled workers and will put pressure on the country\u2019s leaders to keep its education system up to the task.\nMany of Japan\u2019s biggest players have to look beyond the country\u2019s borders in their quest for growth. The declining population helped drive Takeda Pharmaceutical\u2019s deal on Tuesday for Shire \u2014 the largest overseas acquisition ever by a Japanese company.\n\u201cThe undertow pulling at the dynamics of growth is the main limit to what Japan can do on a sustained basis,\u201d said Kenneth Courtis, chairman of the finance firm Starfort Investment Holdings. Though Japan has some competitive companies that will continue to excel, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if that changes the overall equation.\u201d\nJapan also had several false starts over the past quarter-century, only to stumble back into the doldrums. If this time is different, one big reason will be companies like Irie Koken.\nMr. Irie said business had not been this good since he took over as the company\u2019s president 19 years ago. Sales more than doubled in its last fiscal year.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t catch up with all our orders,\u201d Mr. Irie said.\nWith I.T. becoming more critical to just about every sector and factories looking to improve efficiency, greater demand is expected for robots, chips and other high-tech products \u2014 and the made-in-Japan parts and machines needed to manufacture them.\n\u201cEven if there is a recession, I don\u2019t see it changing speed right now,\u201d said Rosen Diankov, chief technology officer at the robotics company Mujin Inc.\nMr. Diankov, an American robotics specialist, founded Mujin in 2011 with Issei Takino of Japan, a former cutting-tool sales manager, to produce devices that control industrial robots. Its headquarters in a refurbished warehouse in east Tokyo have the hipster vibe of a garage start-up, with offices and workshops cluttered with equipment.\nSuch entrepreneurial companies are all too rare in Japan, where venture capital and risk-taking are scarce compared with the United States or China. But Mujin\u2019s founders believe that Japan is leading the way in automation, and they wanted to be part of the action.\n\u201cWe could have opened our company in Silicon Valley,\u201d said Mr. Takino, the company\u2019s chief executive. \u201cOne of the good things about being in Japan is that it is very easy to find a customer.\u201d\nMujin\u2019s technology can appear retro at first glance. One hand-held remote looks as if it belongs with a 1990s video game console. But Mujin says its advanced components make robots more efficient and easier to use, and are hard for competitors to recreate.\nThe sheer complexity of these Japanese specialties may help the economy maintain a competitive edge. Unlike the TVs, CD players and other consumer electronics that drove Japan\u2019s past boom, Mujin\u2019s controllers and Irie Koken\u2019s bellows are much harder for manufacturers in China and elsewhere to replicate. When the Beijing-based online retailer JD.com wanted to automate an unmanned warehouse in China, it turned to Mujin.\nSome of Japan\u2019s big corporations are heading in the same direction. The electronics giant Panasonic was once synonymous with televisions and videorecorders. But over the past six years, it has drastically downsized its consumer businesses \u2014 it no longer sells televisions in the United States \u2014 and shifted into industrial electronics, including the batteries for Tesla roadsters and sensors and cameras for automobiles.\n\u201cIt is very important to position ourselves wisely,\u201d said Yasuyuki Higuchi, chief executive of Panasonic\u2019s connected solutions unit. \u201cOtherwise, we cannot be competitive.\u201d\nHowever, even the most competitive sectors aren\u2019t immune from Japan\u2019s problems. Severe labor shortages are already plaguing businesses, said Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at the research firm Capital Economics, who added that the country was not welcoming nearly enough foreigners to offset the impact.\n\u201cThe demographic headwinds will continue to resist,\u201d said Mr. Thieliant, who estimates that Japan\u2019s current spate of growth has already ended. \u201cIf you don\u2019t get more immigrants in, you eventually hit a wall.\u201d\nMr. Irie has struggled to find the workers he needs to fill the deluge of new orders. His customers now have to wait twice as long as usual for their bellows \u2014 up to five months. \u201cThe economy is very good, so good workers are being taken by other companies,\u201d he complained.\nThe shortage has prodded management to invent new ways to attract talent. Mujin employs a chef to cook lunch for the staff every day. Mr. Irie in recent years has taken all of his employees on a Hawaii vacation and renovated the company\u2019s offices.\n\u201cThe older employees asked, \u2018Why do you have to spend money to make things stylish?\u2019\u201d Mr. Irie said. \u201cThe image of manufacturing may not be very nice. We want to change it.\u201d\nHe remains optimistic, too. He plans to expand the capacity of his factory in Japan over the next few years, possibly making the company\u2019s largest investment ever.\n\u201cWe are riding a wave,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can be on this wave because we have something special.\u201d", "date": "May 8, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/business/japan-economy-manufacturing.html", "tags": "company mojo mujin japan seeks makes companies \u201d economic irie stuff \u2014"}
