Gen. Chris Ghika, who is also the deputy commander of the American-led coalition fighting the Islamic State \u2014 run \u201ccounter to the identified credible threats available to intelligence from U.S. and allies regarding Iranian-backed forces in the region.\u201d\nThe rare public dispute highlights a central problem for the Trump administration as it seeks to rally allies and global opinion against Iran.\nOver the last year, Washington has said Iran is threatening United States interests in the Middle East, encouraging aggression by Shiite militias in Lebanon, Iraq and Syria, shipping missiles to Houthi rebels in Yemen and allowing its naval forces to behave belligerently in the Persian Gulf.\nAll are concerns that have been leveled against Iranian forces for years.\n\u201cWe are aware of their presence clearly and we monitor them along with a whole range of others because of the environment we are in,\u201d General Ghika said.\nBut he said, \u201cNo, there has been no increased threat from Iranian-backed forces in Iraq or Syria.\u201d\nIntelligence and military officials in Europe as well as in the United States said that over the past year, most aggressive moves have originated not in Tehran, but in Washington \u2014 where John R. Bolton, the national security adviser, has prodded President Trump into backing Iran into a corner.\nOne American official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential internal planning, said the new intelligence of an increased Iranian threat was \u201csmall stuff\u201d and did not merit the military planning being driven by Mr. Bolton. The official also said the ultimate goal of the yearlong economic sanctions campaign by the Trump administration was to draw Iran into an armed conflict with the United States.\nSince May 2018, the Trump administration has withdrawn from the major powers agreement that curbed Iran\u2019s nuclear program, reimposed punishing sanctions on Tehran, demanded that allies choose between Iranian oil and doing business in the American market, and declared the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps a terrorist organization.\nAnd on Tuesday, the State Department appeared on the verge of ordering a partial evacuation of the American Embassy in Baghdad as a heightened security measure, according to people familiar with the plans.\nThe anti-Iran push has proved difficult even among the allies, which remember a similar campaign against Iraq that was led in part by Mr. Bolton and was fueled by false claims that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2019s efforts this week to recruit European countries to back the administration\u2019s steely posture on Iran are being received coolly.\nFederica Mogherini, the European Union\u2019s foreign affairs chief, called for \u201cmaximum restraint\u201d after meeting on Monday in Brussels with Mr. Pompeo, a proponent of the \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign against Iran.\nIraqi officials said they were skeptical of the American intelligence that Mr. Pompeo presented last week on a surprise trip to Baghdad. Mr. Pompeo said the threat was to American \u201cfacilities\u201d and military personnel in Iraq.\nIn September, Trump administration officials blamed Shiite militias with ties to Iran for firing a few rockets into the area near the United States Embassy in Baghdad and the American Consulate in Basra. There were no injuries, but Mr. Pompeo ordered the Basra Consulate closed.\nPrivately, several European officials described Mr. Bolton and Mr. Pompeo as pushing an unsuspecting Mr. Trump through a series of steps that could put the United States on a course to war before the president realizes it.\nWhile Mr. Trump has made no secret of his reluctance to engage in another military conflict in the Middle East, and has ordered American troops home from Syria, his secretary of state and his national security adviser have pushed a maximalist hard-line approach on Iran. Mr. Bolton, in particular, has repeatedly called for American military strikes against Tehran.\nOfficials said Mr. Trump was aware that Mr. Bolton\u2019s instinctual approach to Iran could lead to war; aides suggested that the president\u2019s own aversion to drawn-out overseas conflicts would be the best hope of putting the brakes on military escalation.\nA spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment.\nThe Trump administration is looking at plans to send as many as 120,000 troops to the Middle East should Iran attack American forces or accelerate work on nuclear weapons, The New York Times reported. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump dismissed that as \u201cfake news.\u201d \u201cWe have not planned for that,\u201d he told reporters.\nBut he immediately added, \u201cIf we did that, we\u2019d send a hell of a lot more troops than that.\u201d\nSome of the president\u2019s critics accept that Iran continues to engage in what United States officials call \u201cmalign behavior,\u201d be it in Yemen, Syria or the Palestinian territories. But they blamed the administration for aggravating the standoff with Tehran.\n\u201cThis is a crisis that has entirely been manufactured by the Trump administration,\u201d said Vali R. Nasr, the dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.\nHe pointed to Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal in May 2018, coupled with the administration\u2019s failure to get any other nations to do so.\n\u201cNone of the other signatories to the deal were persuaded by the case the U.S. was making,\u201d Mr. Nasr said. \u201cAnd that is because this administration\u2019s policy on Iran, at a fundamental level, does not have credibility.\u201d\nThat lack of trust has proved to be a major obstacle in convincing allies that Iranian behavior in the region warrants military action.\nAnd while the acting defense secretary, Patrick Shanahan, has carefully cultivated a more acquiescent stance to Mr. Bolton\u2019s demands than did his predecessor, Jim Mattis, many military officials and congressional representatives worry about the escalating tensions. Mr. Mattis had balked at Mr. Bolton\u2019s request for military options against Iran after the rockets landed on the American Embassy grounds in Baghdad.\n\u201cBolton did the same with President George W. Bush and Iraq,\u201d Representative Seth Moulton, Democrat of Massachusetts and an Iraq war veteran, said in a statement last week. \u201cAs someone sent four times to that misguided war, I have seen the costs of Bolton\u2019s disastrous foreign policy in a way he never will \u2014 firsthand, and at the loss of thousands of American lives.\u201d\nOne big worry is that the Trump administration has issued the most expansive type of warning to Iran, without drawing specific red lines. That has increased the chance of a military conflict over misinterpretations and miscalculations.\nIn a statement this month, Mr. Bolton outlined vague terms of what appeared to be conditions for military engagement, responding to what he said were \u201ctroubling and escalatory indications and warnings.\u201d\nHe said \u201cany attack on United States interests or on those of our allies will be met with unrelenting force.\u201d And he warned that the administration was \u201cfully prepared to respond to any attack\u201d by the Iranian military or a \u201cproxy\u201d \u2014 one of the Middle East\u2019s many Shiite militias that are supported by Iran.\nThose militias often do not operate under direct command and control from Iran, and they have varying levels of allegiance to the Iran military.\nIn Yemen\u2019s civil war, the Houthis are Shiite rebels who oppose a government backed by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and other Sunni nations. The Houthis\u2019 ties to Iran are murky. But the Trump administration labels the rebels as Iranian proxies, and Mr. Bolton\u2019s statement left open the possibility that a Houthi attack on Saudi Arabia or the U.A.E. \u2014 both United States allies \u2014 could set off an American military assault against Iran.\nIn statements, Iranian leaders have reacted with both belligerence and diplomatic restraint to a series of American actions that they see as provocative. In a tweet on Tuesday, the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, ridiculed Mr. Bolton and three anti-Iran foreign leaders in the Middle East as a \u201cB Team.\u201d\n\u201cIn interviews in April, I predicted \u2018accidents\u2019 \u2014 not because I\u2019m a genius \u2014 but because #B_Team is so brazenly following @AmbJohnBolton\u2019s script,\u201d Mr. Zarif said. \u201cAfter all, half of B-Team were co-conspirators in disastrous Iraq war.\u201d\nThe hard-line tactics against Iran could backfire in two ways, said Ali Vaez of the International Crisis Group. If the sanctions crush its economy, then Iran could act with less restraint, he said. And if the sanctions do not work well, then some American officials will advocate military action, a move that Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are likely to support.\n\u201cThere will be people in Washington who will push for limited kinetic action against the Iranian regime to cut it down to size,\u201d he said.", "date": "May 14, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/world/middleeast/trump-iran-threats.html", "tags": "allies iran american administration military bolton u.s. resist claims \u201d trump skeptical new threats said"}
