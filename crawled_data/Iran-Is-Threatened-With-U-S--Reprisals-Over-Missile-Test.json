{"title": "Iran Is Threatened With U.S. Reprisals Over Missile Test", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration on Wednesday fired a warning shot at a perennial adversary, declaring that it was \u201cputting Iran on notice\u201d after a recent ballistic missile launch, and threatening the Iranian government with unspecified reprisals.\n\u201cAs of today, we are officially putting Iran on notice,\u201d said Michael T. Flynn, the national security adviser, making his debut in the White House briefing room to read a terse statement that was almost as critical of the Obama administration as it was of Iran.\n\u201cThe Trump administration condemns such actions by Iran that undermine security, prosperity and stability throughout and beyond the Middle East, and place American lives at risk,\u201d he said.\nMr. Flynn said the missile test was the latest in a series of provocative actions by Iran and violated a United Nations Security Council resolution restricting its ballistic missile program \u2014 something the Iranians deny. Mr. Flynn did not specify how the United States would respond, although other officials have said the White House is weighing sanctions and other measures to counter Iranian initiatives throughout the Middle East and the Persian Gulf.\nHis blunt tone \u2014 and lack of specifics \u2014 offered an early sign of how President Trump plans to deal with Iran: pushing back against Tehran on multiple fronts and leaving all options, including military action, on the table.\nMr. Flynn singled out Iran\u2019s support for Houthi rebels in Yemen, who recently attacked a Saudi naval vessel.\nTo that end, Defense Department officials said they have been directed to explore ways the United States can challenge Iran in Yemen, where the Houthis have been battling Saudi Arabia and other American allies.\n\u201cIn these and other similar activities,\u201d Mr. Flynn said, \u201cIran continues to threaten U.S. friends and allies in the region.\u201d\nAt a subsequent official briefing, a senior administration official said the White House was considering a range of options \u2014 and he did not rule out military force. But he also said the administration, in its second week, did not want to be premature or rash in how it confronted Tehran.\nThe challenge for the administration in contemplating economic pressure is that it would be all but impossible to reassemble the international coalition that imposed draconian sanctions on Iran\u2019s oil and banking industries \u2014 and drew Iran into negotiations that resulted in the agreement limiting its nuclear program.\nMr. Flynn pinned much of the blame for Iran\u2019s aggressiveness on former President Barack Obama, saying his administration \u201cfailed to respond adequately to Tehran\u2019s malign actions \u2014 including weapons transfers, support for terrorism and other violations of international norms.\u201d\nHe also noted that Mr. Trump had criticized agreements between Iran and the Obama administration as \u201cweak and ineffective.\u201d During the campaign, Mr. Trump spoke of ripping up the Iran nuclear agreement, though his aides now say their focus is less on abrogating that deal than on constraining Iran\u2019s behavior in the region.\nIn Yemen, for example, the Pentagon is considering stepped-up patrols and perhaps even airstrikes, aimed at preventing Iranian weapons from getting to the Houthis. In addition, Saudi officials are pushing for more support for their air campaign in Yemen, an administration official said. But officials said on Wednesday that there had been no change in the military\u2019s posture.\nWhile the Obama administration targeted Houthis and conducted airstrikes against forces aligned with Al Qaeda in Yemen, current and former officials say Mr. Obama was wary of deepening American support for the Saudi air campaign because of concerns about the accuracy of targeting and the large number of civilian casualties.\n\u201cObama said all the time, \u2018Aim before you shoot,\u2019\u201d said Derek Chollet, who served in the White House, the Pentagon and the State Department during the Obama administration. \u201cAnytime there was one of these heated discussions, and people said, \u2018We\u2019ve got to do something,\u2019 he said, \u2018O.K., what does the intel say, and where will this take us?\u2019\u201d\nThe Trump administration, however, said it would continue to criticize and draw distinctions with its predecessor.\n\u201cThis president is seeking to make the country safer, stronger, more prosperous,\u201d Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said. \u201cI think the president, when it comes \u2014 came \u2014 to the Iran nuclear deal, was very, very adamant in his opposition to the deal and to its implications.\u201d\nMr. Flynn\u2019s tough words left some Iran analysts troubled.\nCliff Kupchan, a political risk analyst at the Eurasia Group in Washington, said the tone was \u201cvery worrisome.\u201d He and others also questioned how Iran\u2019s missile test had violated the Security Council resolution in question, in which Iran is \u201ccalled upon\u201d to refrain from missile tests but is not forbidden to conduct them.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all Michael Flynn, Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller right now,\u201d Mr. Kupchan said in an email, referring to the national security adviser and two other hard-line Trump aides. \u201cThe \u2018revolutionaries\u2019 are running the Trump administration.\u201d\nOther analysts, however, said the stiffer tone was overdue.\n\u201cIt was very sensible for the administration to early on warn Iran of its malign activities,\u201d said Ray Takeyh, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cThe fact is that Iran is probably testing the administration to see if there is any pushback. Over the past few years they have not been given too many stern warnings.\u201d\nEarlier on Wednesday, Iran confirmed that it had recently conducted a missile test, but it rejected accusations that the launch had violated a Security Council resolution.\nThe confirmation by the Iranian defense minister, Hossein Dehghan, was the first by an official there since the country was accused of violating the 2015 resolution because the test involved a ballistic missile that could theoretically carry a nuclear warhead.\nHis remarks came a day after President Hassan Rouhani disparaged Mr. Trump for his order barring refugees, as well as citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries including Iran. \u201cBanning visas for other nations is the act of newcomers to the political scene,\u201d Mr. Rouhani said.\nMr. Dehghan emphasized that the missile test did not, in Iran\u2019s view, violate the resolution, or the 2015 nuclear agreement that preceded it. No country will be allowed to interfere in Iranian domestic affairs, he said, adding that tests would definitely continue. \u201cOur nation has tested itself in this path,\u201d Mr. Dehghan said.\nThe United States called an urgent meeting of the Security Council on Tuesday to discuss the matter.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to see us call them out as we said we would, and you are also going to see us act accordingly,\u201d Nikki R. Haley, the new United States ambassador to the United Nations, said on Tuesday.", "date": "Feb. 1, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/01/world/middleeast/iran-missile-test.html", "tags": "iran administration reprisals u.s. missile \u201d threatened flynn test \u2014"}
