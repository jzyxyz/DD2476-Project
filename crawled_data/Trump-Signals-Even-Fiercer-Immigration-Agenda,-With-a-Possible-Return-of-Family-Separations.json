{"title": "Trump Signals Even Fiercer Immigration Agenda, With a Possible Return of Family Separations", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s purge of the nation\u2019s top homeland security officials is a sign that he is preparing to unleash an even fiercer assault on immigration, including a possible return of his controversial decision last summer to separate migrant children from their parents, current and former administration officials said Monday.\nMr. Trump shook up the ranks of his top immigration officials after spending months demanding that they take tougher action to stop the surge in migrant families at the border and seething about what he considers their overly legalistic refusals to do what he has said was necessary.\nThat anger was underscored on Monday when a judge blocked Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to force asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while their cases proceed \u2014 a practice that immigration advocates called inhumane and illegal. Judge Richard Seeborg of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California ruled that existing law did not give Mr. Trump the power to enforce the policy, known as \u201cmigrant protection protocols.\u201d\nThe immediate targets of the president\u2019s growing fury about the situation at the border were the officials who he saw as insufficiently steely minded: Kirstjen Nielsen, who resigned  Sunday as the secretary of homeland security, and Ron Vitiello, whose nomination to permanently lead Immigration and Customs Enforcement was pulled after Mr. Trump remarked that \u201cwe want to go in a tougher direction.\u201d\nBut the longer term effect of the eruption of Oval Office frustration is likely to be a burst of hard-line policies that stand out even in an administration that has pursued an unprecedented series of executive actions and rules changes aimed at reducing legal and illegal immigration into the United States.\nIn addition to urging Mr. Trump to revisit the idea of family separation, several of the president\u2019s closest immigration confidants have been pushing him to consider even harsher measures.\nThose include further limits on who can seek asylum; stronger action to close ports of entry along the Mexican border; an executive order to end birthright citizenship; more aggressive construction of a border wall; and a more robust embrace of active-duty troops to secure the border against illegal immigration.\nIn an administration that is famous for chaos and last-minute decision-making, it is unclear on which of those policies the president might choose to move forward. But by removing Ms. Nielsen, Mr. Vitiello and perhaps others, Mr. Trump is getting rid of voices who sometimes cautioned him against taking actions they believed to be illegal or unwise.\n\u201cThere was a perception that Secretary Nielsen was not as committed to the sort of full-throated approach that others in the administration, including the White House, were seeking,\u201d said Seth Grossman, who served as deputy general counsel at the Department of Homeland Security from 2011 to 2015.\nHe said Ms. Nielsen\u2019s exit and Mr. Vitiello\u2019s step back \u201csignals there is an intention to pursue more aggressive policies.\u201d\nThree senior administration officials with knowledge of the president\u2019s conversations over the past several months confirmed that Mr. Trump has repeatedly told aides that he wants to restart the family separation policy. One of the officials said the president had made it clear to aides that he liked Ms. Nielsen personally, but was critical of her job performance. All three officials spoke about the internal discussions on the condition of anonymity.\nStephen Miller, the architect of Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration agenda and one of the president\u2019s closest advisers in the White House, has been an advocate for a modified version of the family separation policy known as \u201cbinary choice.\u201d\nOthers, including Kris Kobach, the former Kansas secretary of state and an informal immigration adviser, and Stephen K. Bannon, the president\u2019s former chief strategist, have also been urging tougher actions.\nUnder a binary choice policy, which is highly controversial, migrant parents would be given a choice of whether to voluntarily allow their children to be separated from them, or to waive their child\u2019s humanitarian protections so the family can be detained together, indefinitely, in jail-like conditions. Immigration advocates have said the idea is inhumane and would be found illegal by courts.\nMs. Nielsen was the head of the department during the Trump administration\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy last year that led to the separation of thousands of families. More than 2,700 children were separated from their parents at the border under that policy to prosecute anyone caught crossing the border illegally, even those with families seeking asylum on humanitarian grounds.\nMr. Trump eventually relented on the family separations, and a federal judge in California halted them in June. But in January, the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services reported that thousands more families might have been separated than previously reported.\nWhile Mr. Trump has been hampered by the law in his efforts to impose some new enforcement policies, there are certain things he can do without congressional approval.\nThose include shutting down ports of entries along the southwestern border and slowing down the process for both illegal and legal immigration.\nLast month, he closed American field offices abroad that had helped facilitate immigration applications. Mr. Trump has also limited the number of people who can request asylum each day through a process known as \u201cmetering,\u201d and he has threatened to shut down traffic lanes and tariff trucks at the ports of entry.\nJonathan Meyer, a former deputy general counsel at the Department of Homeland Security, said the Trump administration will continue to pursue hard-line immigration policies because they are important to the president\u2019s political supporters, who helped fuel Mr. Trump\u2019s success in the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\u201cIt appears that at times it\u2019s less important in this administration, whether they lose or win in court, than to just say they\u2019ve been able to have done it and have it as a talking point,\u201d Mr. Meyer said. \u201cAnd have an opportunity to criticize the courts if they lose.\u201d\nMr. Meyer said installing a new secretary at the department will further embolden Mr. Trump.\n\u201cHe\u2019s willing to move forward and do things even when he knows he\u2019s going to be sued for it and when the legality is in question,\u201d Mr. Meyer said. \u201cIf that\u2019s the position you take and if you have people willing to implement that strategy, there\u2019s a lot of things you can do. But eventually you\u2019re going to be hit with a temporary restraining order.\u201d\nMr. Grossman said Mr. Trump\u2019s personnel moves were indeed a signal that the administration would embrace aggressive policies. But he added that Mr. Trump has threatened to enact such policies before, only to back off.\nThe president could also be stymied by further court rulings blocking his efforts to crack down on immigrants.\nOn Monday in California, the judge said in his ruling that in addition to violating immigration laws, the protocols did not include \u201csufficient safeguards\u201d to comply with the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s obligation against returning migrants to places where their \u201clife or freedom would be threatened.\u201d\nImmigration advocates hailed the decision, calling it the latest victory in the legal battles with the Trump administration that began when the president imposed a travel ban on several predominantly Muslim countries just days after taking office in 2017.\n\u201cTry as it may, the Trump administration cannot simply ignore our laws in order to accomplish its goal of preventing people from seeking asylum in the United States,\u201d said Judy Rabinovitz, the deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, who argued the case.\nThe Trump administration had negotiated the protocols with the Mexican government because of the president\u2019s longstanding anger with so-called catch and release policies in which asylum seekers are temporarily released into the United States while they wait for their court hearings.\nThe policy of forcing some asylum seekers to wait in Mexico was an effort to stop that from happening. But the court ruling means that the president will have to abandon it, at least for the time being.", "date": "April 8, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/08/us/politics/trump-asylum-seekers-federal-judge.html", "tags": "possible administration immigration mr. officials signals border even return \u201d trump fiercer agenda separations said family"}
