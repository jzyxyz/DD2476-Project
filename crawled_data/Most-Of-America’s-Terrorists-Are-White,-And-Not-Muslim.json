{"title": "Most Of America\u2019s Terrorists Are White, And Not Muslim", "content": "When it comes to domestic terrorism in America, the numbers don\u2019t lie: Far-right extremists are behind far more plots and attacks than Islamist extremists.\u00a0\nThere were almost twice as many terrorist incidents by right-wing extremists as by Islamist extremists in the U.S. from 2008 to 2016, according to a new report from The Nation Institute\u2019s Investigative Fund\u00a0and The Center for Investigative Reporting\u2019s Reveal.\nLooking at both plots and attacks carried out, the group tracked\u00a0201 terrorist incidents on U.S. soil from January 2008 to the end of 2016. The database shows 115 cases by right-wing extremists \u2015 from white supremacists to militias to \u201csovereign citizens\u201d \u2015 compared to 63 cases by Islamist extremists.\u00a0Incidents from left-wing extremists, which include ecoterrorists and animal rights militants, were comparatively rare, with 19 incidents.\u00a0\nWhile the database makes a point of distinguishing between different groups within right-wing extremism,\u00a0lead reporter David Neiwert\u00a0told HuffPost that \u201cthose are all gradations of white supremacy, variations on the same thing.\u201d When it comes to right-wing extremism, attackers are also \u201cmostly men\u201d and \u201calmost purely white,\u201d Neiwert said. \u00a0\nAttacks by right-wing extremists were also more often deadly, with nearly a third of right-wing extremist incidents resulting in deaths compared with 13 percent of Islamist extremist cases resulting in deaths. However, the sheer number of people killed by Islamist extremists \u2015 a total of 90 people killed\u00a0\u2015 was higher than the death toll at the hands of right-wing extremists \u2015 79 people killed.\nMeanwhile, President Donald Trump has focused his rhetoric and policies almost entirely on countering Islamist extremism, and not white supremacist extremism. \u00a0\n\u201cAs with a lot of things related to Trump and the Islamophobic right, the reality is viewed through an upside-down looking glass,\u201d Neiwert\u00a0said. \u201cThe reality is the most significant domestic terror threat we have is right-wing extremism.\u201d\nThe Investigative Fund\u2019s findings reflect those of previous studies of domestic terrorism. The New America Foundation, for instance, which has been tracking deadly terror incidents on U.S. soil since the Sept. 11 attacks, also finds an almost two-to-one ratio of attacks by far-right extremists to Islamist extremists, with 21 deadly attacks by far-right extremists, compared to 11 by Islamist extremists.\nDespite the facts, many Americans still associate terror attacks with Islamist extremists rather than far-right extremists, Neiwart noted.\u00a0\n\u201cI think the larger perception in the public \u2015 and this includes many progressives and liberals \u2015 is the inversion of the reality: that the greatest threat we face is Islamist radicals,\u201d Neiwert said.\u00a0\u201cAnd it\u2019s reflected in the way the press report upon various kinds of domestic terror attacks: When it\u2019s a white domestic terrorist, they underplay it, write it off to mental illness.\u201d\nThe media has a long history of double standards when it comes to covering terrorism \u2015 starting with how slow mainstream media is to label attacks by white perpetrators as \u201cterrorism,\u201d and quick to label them as such\u00a0when attackers are perceived as nonwhite or \u201cother\u201d \u2015 and specifically, Muslim.\nPart of problem is the complex nature of how officials choose to categorize attacks\u00a0as terrorism. The FBI has specific criteria\u00a0its uses to classify terrorist incidents \u2015 but the public doesn\u2019t always agree with officials\u2019 labels. For instance, many people condemned the government for not labeling Dylann Roof a terrorist after he killed nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015, even though he specifically said he was there \u201cto shoot black people,\u201d according to witnesses.\u00a0\n\u201cThere\u2019s actually a debate over whether what Dylann Roof did was domestic terrorism, when it so plainly is domestic terrorism,\u201d Neiwert told HuffPost. \u201cA lot of this has to do with embedded judgements about where these threats come from \u2015 and that has to do with fear-mongering around Islamophobia.\u201d\nThe solution, according to Neiwert, lies with the government first acknowledging the scale of the problem of far-right extremism, and then dedicating resources to fighting it.\nSo far Trump has shown a clear\u00a0double standard in his response to terrorism: After Islamist extremists attacked London on June 3, for instance, Trump condemned the violence on Twitter the same day \u2015 but after an attack in Portland, Oregon, by a white supremacist on May 26, Trump waited more than two days before tweeting about it. After the London attack, Trump also called on the courts to reinstate his travel ban on certain Muslim-majority countries \u2015 which was roundly criticized. After the Portland attack, Trump made no calls to change policy to prevent future attacks.\nThe Trump administration also reportedly just dropped funding for nonprofit Life After Hate, a group that helps people leave the white supremacist movement.\nBut it\u2019s not just Trump that\u2019s the problem. The Fund\u2019s database goes back to 2008 and shows clearly how government resources have been disproportionately dedicated to tackling Islamist extremism over right-wing extremism. The government succeeded in interrupting the vast majority of Islamist extremist terror cases since 2008, for instance: 76 percent of incidents tracked were \u201cfoiled plots,\u201d which the group noted showed \u201ca significant investment of law enforcement resources.\u201d When it came to right-wing extremism, only about a third of incidents were interrupted \u2015 35 percent \u2015 and the majority of the cases included acts of violence that led to deaths, injuries or damaged property.\u00a0\nAt the end of the day, it\u2019s not only on the government to acknowledge the reality of the growing threat of far-right extremism, according to Neiwert, it\u2019s on everyone from members of the media to average Americans.\n\u201cFirst thing we need to do is recognize that it\u2019s there, it\u2019s a problem, it\u2019s a threat \u2015 as great a threat as Islamists,\u201d Neiwert said. \u201cAnd it needs to be taken seriously.\u201d", "date": "\n06/23/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/domestic-terrorism-white-supremacists-islamist-extremists_n_594c46e4e4b0da2c731a84df", "tags": "extremists america extremism white \u201d \u2015 muslim incidents right-wing islamist terrorists attacks"}
