Two American military bases he mentioned among the five targets \u2014 Fort Ritchie and Fort McClellan \u2014 closed many years ago.\nPresident Vladimir V. Putin got the whole thing started with his state of the nation speech last week, when he said that should the United States deploy new missiles in Europe, Russia could respond with a whole quiver of high-tech weapons.\n\u201cRussia will be forced to create and deploy weapons that can be used not only in the areas we are directly threatened from, but also in areas that contain decision-making centers for the missile systems threatening us,\u201d he said.\nHe was a little coy about specifying the decision-making centers.\nAfter the speech, however, Mr. Putin hosted a background briefing with news media editors, in which, according to Russian reports, the president said that if the United States moved missiles into Poland, Russia would deploy submarines off American shores.\nMr. Kiselyev, already famous for saying some years ago that Russia could reduce the United States to \u201cnuclear dust,\u201d ran with that threat.\nSome Putin supporters applauded the sentiment. On a talk show immediately following the news program, one commentator said there was no need to rely on weapons like tanks since the response would be nuclear.\nCritics, however, were scathing, suggesting that Russia was saber rattling from a position of weakness. Just moments before, the same news program reported that some 200,000 Russian children attend schools with only outhouses for toilets, one commentator noted on Twitter, asking what exactly was worth defending with nuclear-tipped missiles.\nAnother commentator wondered how Russians would react if CNN broadcast a program detailing American plans to strike Moscow and St. Petersburg with nuclear weapons.\nIn the ensuing outcry, Dmitri S. Peskov, Mr. Putin\u2019s spokesman, echoed his boss\u2019s coyness by noting that the president himself had not singled out any target by name.\nOver all, several factors motivated the belligerent rhetoric, analysts said, in addition to the United States\u2019 withdrawal from the I.N.F. Treaty.\nThreatening Washington, they noted, was an old method of improving relations. Just as new rules for interaction were forged out of the Cuban missile crisis, so too could a renewed sense of threat help entente, which has not worked out as swimmingly as the Kremlin envisaged under President Trump.\n\u201cThey still want to be on equal footing with the United States \u2014 that is why they want to create this crisis,\u201d said Ivan I. Kurilla, a historian at the European University at St. Petersburg who specializes in Russian-American relations. Submarines off the American coast \u201cwill keep Russia important for the United States, and that is important to the Russian leadership.\u201d\nThen there is the domestic impact, where a high threat level can generate a certain amount of support for the Kremlin and its measures to quash civil liberties, analysts said. In other words, if you are going to label your critics \u201cforeign agents,\u201d you need to identify the enemy for whom they slave.\nWhich brings us back to the atomic song in the cathedral on Feb. 23.\nIn commemoration of Defenders of the Fatherland Day \u2014 informally known as Man\u2019s Day, speaking of throwbacks \u2014 a choir singing at St. Isaac\u2019s Cathedral in St. Petersburg performed a rendition of a circa-1980 song, \u201cOn a Submarine, or a Serviceman\u2019s Pay.\u201d\nThe gist of the song, considered caustic at the time it was written, was that in exchange for three rubles any Russian submariner would be happy to annihilate the United States. The opening stanza goes:\nThe social media chorus responded with accusations of poor taste, at best, and thinly veiled hostility, at worst.\nIf protesters with Pussy Riot were jailed for years over a protest song they performed in a Moscow cathedral, where were all the believers who should have been equally offended by a song endorsing Armageddon, mused one critic on social media.\nThe St. Petersburg Concert Choir issued a statement saying that its critics could not take a joke. The choir did not need to limit itself to liturgical works, the statement said, or to rewrite lyrics for political correctness.\nGiven the climate, however, analysts suggested it was a poor choice, particularly since there was nothing light about the booming rendition.\n\u201cIt was a joke, but a bad joke exactly because of the current propaganda,\u201d said Mr. Kurilla, the historian.", "date": "Feb. 26, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/26/world/europe/russia-nuclear-cathedral-choir.html", "tags": "\u2018 washington \u201c nuclear city revives playbook united states aim say war russia \u2014 cold st."}
