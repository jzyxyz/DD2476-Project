{"title": "Some Aid From Brazil Pierces Venezuela\u2019s Blockade, but Deadly Violence Erupts", "content": "C\u00daCUTA, Colombia \u2014 An ambitious plan by Venezuela\u2019s opposition to peacefully import foreign aid in truck convoys degenerated into deadly skirmishes Saturday along the impoverished country\u2019s borders, with a smattering of supplies getting through but most of it blocked by armed loyalists of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.\nThe aid deliveries, promised by the opposition leader, Juan Guaid\u00f3, have been viewed as a major test of his credibility in the month since he declared himself president and promised to call for new elections and end Venezuela\u2019s economic free-fall.\n\u201cThe humanitarian aid is definitely on its way to Venezuela, in a peaceful manner, to save lives right now,\u201d said Mr. Guaid\u00f3, standing in front of a warehouse on the Colombian side of the border.\nAs the day progressed, some of the humanitarian aid pierced Mr. Maduro\u2019s blockade \u2014 one truck got through on a remote section of the border with Brazil \u2014 but most of it did not. And although a few members of the security forces defected, Mr. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s hope that the armed forces would step aside and even join his flag-waving supporters did not come to pass.\nA day that was billed by the opposition as decisive in the struggle with Mr. Maduro over the country\u2019s leadership turned chaotic and inconclusive. Mr. Maduro, furious that Colombia had helped the opposition, broke relations with its government and gave its diplomats 24 hours to get out.\nThere also was no guarantee that the 35-year-old opposition leader, who has emerged as the biggest political threat to Mr. Maduro, would even be allowed back into Venezuela by the authorities, who had barred him from traveling abroad.\nMr. Maduro, who has called Mr. Guaid\u00f3 a Trump administration stooge, said the promises of emergency aid masked an American plot to invade Venezuela, and he vowed to thwart it.\nAs protesters clashed with security forces at various points along the border with Brazil in the south and Colombia in the west, a defiant Mr. Maduro took to a stage in the capital, Caracas, dancing the salsa with his wife and addressing supporters in an event carried on national television.\n\u201cI am stronger than ever,\u201d he said, before asking, \u201cWhy am I here? Because you are the ones who decide, not Donald Trump.\u201d\nHe also called Mr. Guaid\u00f3 a \u201cpuppet of imperialism,\u201d and explained the break with Colombia, which effectively sealed Venezuela off, as the borders with Brazil and three Caribbean islands were already closed.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t keep putting up with the Colombian territory being used for attacks against Venezuela,\u201d Mr. Maduro said. \u201cFor that reason, I have decided to break all political and diplomatic relations with Colombia\u2019s fascist government.\u201d\nThe White House condemned the use of force by Mr. Maduro\u2019s government, warning that rights violations \u201cwill not go unpunished,\u201d and urging the military to \u201cuphold its constitutional duty to protect the citizens of Venezuela\u201d and allow aid to enter the country.\nMike Pence, the vice president, is scheduled to visit Colombia and meet with Iv\u00e1n Duque, the country\u2019s president, on Monday. He is expected to continue urging Mr. Maduro to step down.\nEarlier on Saturday, on the borders with Colombia and Brazil, opposition protesters waved banners and chanted antigovernment slogans as they waited to escort trucks full of humanitarian aid across several bridges into Venezuela.\nTwo pickup trucks of aid crossed into Venezuela from the Brazilian town of Pacaraima in the country\u2019s north, in what opposition figures said was a small but symbolic puncture of Mr. Maduro\u2019s pledge to keep unauthorized assistance out.\n\u201cWe did it,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Teresa Belandria, who is the Brazil envoy of Mr. Guaid\u00f3. \u201cThis is a major victory.\u201d\nBut as of Saturday night, the trucks remained stranded on the border, according to Jes\u00fas Bobadillo, a Catholic priest in Pacaraima, the Brazilian border town.\n\u201cThis whole thing has failed,\u201d Mr. Bobadillo said Saturday night in a phone interview, lamenting that with the borders shut, the crisis could worsen for the neediest people. \u201cThe drama of hunger and lack of medicine continues, but now it\u2019s even worse because at least before, people had an escape valve.\u201d\nOn Friday, Venezuelan forces near the border with Brazil had opened fire on a crowd blocking access to a road, killing two people. On Saturday, the National Guard continued to attack, firing tear gas and live ammunition at civilians, according to the opposition lawmaker Am\u00e9rico de Grazia.\nBy the end of the day Saturday, at least two more people were dead, according to Alfredo Romero, the head of Foro Penal, an organization that tracks violence in Venezuela. And Colombia\u2019s migration authorities said 23 members of the security forces had crossed the border and defected from Mr. Maduro\u2019s authoritarian regime.\nBut there were no signs of major breaches in the blockade. Trouble erupted as a march near a footbridge to Colombia degenerated into running battles between young protesters and security forces, underscoring the risks Mr. Maduro\u2019s adversaries are taking in their campaign against him.\nThat march, in the Venezuelan border town of Ure\u00f1a, was meant to clear a path for aid to be delivered via a footbridge blocked by Mr. Maduro\u2019s forces. Local residents tried to storm the bridge, but Venezuelan security forces fired tear gas to disperse them, and clashes left a trail of damage and burning vehicles.\n\u201cI just couldn\u2019t keep quiet anymore,\u201d said Edilson Cisneros, who was hit with buckshot as he walked with opposition lawmakers in Ure\u00f1a. \u201cToo many people are having a hard time here. This can\u2019t go on like that anymore.\u201d\nThe border showdown has become one of the most tense and unusual in the region\u2019s history.\nMr. Guaid\u00f3 has been recognized as Venezuela\u2019s interim president by more than 50 countries, including the United States. He has staked his challenge to Mr. Maduro on a promise that he will do what the president refuses to: open the country, which suffers from deadly shortages of food and medicine, to international aid shipments.\nThe White House has waded deep into the standoff, authorizing shipments of aid on military planes and holding a rally at which President Trump warned Venezuela\u2019s military to abandon Mr. Maduro or \u201close everything.\u201d\nMr. Maduro now claims that the aid containers are part of a plot that will lead to an American invasion. His government erected shipping containers on the Tienditas Bridge to keep the aid out.\nBefore the border closing, Mr. Guaid\u00f3 himself slipped into Colombia, where he was greeted like a rock star at a Latin pop music concert in support of the opposition that was sponsored by the British billionaire Richard Branson.\nSeveral hundred Venezuelans had gathered on Friday night in an empty lot beside the Tienditas Bridge here in the Colombian border city of C\u00facuta, under a massive flag hung from a crane. Many slept on open ground in the makeshift camp as opposition activists organized prayer circles and danced to salsa music, calling for the downfall of Mr. Maduro.\n\u201cI know it\u2019s been a long night, but we are moving ahead,\u201d an opposition member, Adolfo Mar\u00edn, said to the crowd. \u201cRemember we have a blockade, but manpower is supernatural \u2014 believe me, with a small group of people we can move these containers with a push and a shove.\u201d\nVictor Barboza, an organizer in the camp, said: \u201cThe soldiers of the lower and middle classes today need humanitarian aid, too,\u201d referring to the security forces waiting on the other side of the bridge. \u201cThey have a child who eats just one meal a day. They have a sister who can\u2019t get medication for her illness.\u201d\nMany Colombians expressed sympathy with Mr. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s cause and solidarity with those on the other side of the border. But many others, like Mr. Bobadillo, the priest, lamented that humanitarian aid has become heavily politicized as the standoff between Mr. Maduro and Mr. Guaid\u00f3 escalates.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been used and abused by both sides,\u201d Mr. Bobadillo said. \u201cI am not a political analyst, but I fear that in the end this may leave us with Maduro feeling stronger and more arrogant.\u201d", "date": "Feb. 23, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/23/world/americas/venezuela-aid-border-maduro.html", "tags": "deadly opposition \u201c maduro venezuela border aid blockade erupts pierces colombia brazil violence"}
