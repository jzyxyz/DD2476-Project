{"title": "Trump Orders Help For Chinese Phone-Maker After China Approves Money For Trump Project", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 A mere 72 hours after the Chinese government agreed to put a half-billion dollars into an Indonesian project that will personally enrich Donald Trump, the president ordered a bailout for a Chinese-government-owned cellphone maker.\n\u201cPresident Xi of China, and I, are working together to give massive Chinese phone company, ZTE, a way to get back into business, fast,\u201d Trump announced on Twitter Sunday morning. \u201cToo many jobs in China lost. Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done!\u201d\nTrump did not mention in that tweet or its follow-ups that on Thursday, the developer of a theme park resort outside of Jakarta had signed a deal to receive as much as $500 million in Chinese government loans, as well as another $500 million from Chinese banks, according to Agence France-Presse. Trump\u2019s family business, the Trump Organization, has a deal to license the Trump name to the resort, which includes a golf course and hotels.\nTrump,\u00a0despite his campaign promises to turn over his businesses and have no involvement with them,\u00a0has still not fully divested himself of his businesses, and continues to profit from them.\n\u201cYou do a good deal for him, he does a good deal for you. Quid pro quo,\u201d said Richard Painter, the White House ethics lawyer for former President George W. Bush and now a Democratic candidate for Senate in Minnesota.\n\u201cThis appears to be yet another violation of the emoluments clause of the Constitution,\u201d Painter said, referring to the prohibition against the president receiving payments from foreign governments.\nThe White House did not respond to HuffPost queries asking if there was a connection between the \u201cMNC Lido City\u201d project and Trump\u2019s directive regarding ZTE.\nAt Monday\u2019s daily briefing, Deputy Press Secretary Raj Shah referred questions about the Indonesian project to the Trump Organization. \u201cThat\u2019s not something that I can speak to,\u201d he said.\nThe Trump Organization on Monday acknowledged its involvement in the resort, but did not respond to questions about how much the company would make from its licensing or management fees.\nZTE phones have already been described as a security risk by the U.S. military and intelligence community. Two weeks ago, the military banned their use on bases for fear they could be used to track the locations of service members.\nThe company, which is owned 33 percent by Chinese-government-owned enterprises, had been fined $1.2 billion last year after it was found to be violating U.S. sanctions against Iran and North Korea. After it was determined that ZTE officials had lied about their actions, the U.S. government last month banned it from purchasing U.S. components for seven years\u00a0\u2014 a decision that essentially forced the company to shut down.\nTrump followed up late Monday afternoon with a new tweet on the issue: \u201cZTE, the large Chinese phone company, buys a big percentage of individual parts from U.S. companies. This is also reflective of the larger trade deal we are negotiating with China and my personal relationship with President Xi.\u201d\nThe new statement, however, still did not address the question of the Indonesian resort and the Trump Organization\u2019s coming profit thanks to Chinese investment.\n\u201cThis is stunning. They perpetually find new things to surprise me,\u201d said Robert Weissman, president of the open government advocacy group Public Citizen. \u201cThe idea of the president intervening in a law enforcement matter to satisfy a foreign government is extraordinary. And it\u2019s extraordinary because it doesn\u2019t happen. Opening that door threatens the integrity of all corporate law enforcement.\u201d\nShah, on other ZTE questions at the daily briefing, appeared to downplay the import of Trump\u2019s directive to \u201cget it done.\u201d Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross will examine the matter \u201cconsistent with applicable laws and regulations,\u201d Shah said.\nHe acknowledged, however, that the issue is of great concern to the Chinese and its president, Xi Jinping.\n\u201cIn our bilateral relationship, there is a give and take,\u201d Shah said.\nDuring his campaign, Trump attacked China almost daily for \u201cstealing\u201d U.S. jobs by manipulating its currency and using unfair trade practices. \u201cNo one has ever stolen jobs like other countries have taken from us,\u201d Trump told a Nevada rally on Nov. 5, 2016. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost 70,000 factories since China joined the WTO,\u201d Trump told a Pittsburgh-area audience the following day.\nIn recent months, Trump has been trying to craft a trade agreement with China at the same time he is asking for Xi\u2019s help in cracking down on North Korea because of its nuclear weapons program.\nAt a National Press Club speech Monday, Ross said that the ZTE sanctions were an enforcement action, unrelated to the trade negotiations, but that he would be reviewing the situation \u201cvery, very promptly\u201d as a result of Trump\u2019s request.\nFor ethics advocates, the timing of the ZTE tweet on the heels of the Indonesian development announcement is yet another example of the consequences of Trump\u2019s unwillingness to abide by the emoluments clause.\n\u201cThe Chinese government seems to have figured out a way to manipulate President Trump,\u201d Weissman said. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly why this anti-bribery clause of the Constitution is common sense.\u201d\nClarification:\u00a0Language in this story has been amended to clarify Trump\u2019s campaign promises regarding control of his businesses.", "date": "\n05/14/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-china-zte_n_5af9f701e4b0200bcab7fa66", "tags": "project phone-maker \u201c china president u.s. trump help chinese orders approves money zte government"}
