{"title": "Steve King Promotes White Nationalist On Twitter \u2026 For The Third Time", "content": "For the third time in less than a year, Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) has promoted an open white nationalist on Twitter. \nOn Friday, the congressman quote-tweeted Faith Goldy, a Canadian white nationalist who has publicly recited the \u201c14 words,\u201d a white supremacist mantra, and who once recommended a book that calls for the \u201celimination of Jews.\u201d \nGoldy also once appeared on a podcast produced by The Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi website which advocates for gassing Jews. In that podcast, Goldy praised white supremacist figurehead Richard Spencer. \nKing is well aware of who Goldy is. In October, he endorsed Goldy in her longshot run for mayor of Toronto. The endorsement led to widespread condemnation of the congressman. \nBut at 10:51 p.m. Friday, the congressman promoted Goldy on Twitter anyway. \nIn his tweet, King claimed that \u201ccriminal aliens represented an average of 1/4 of the federal prison population\u201d and that \u201cthere would have to be 82 million illegals in America before they would be committing an equal proportion of crimes.\u201d \nHe then linked to a tweet by Goldy in which she lashes out at Matt Schlapp, head of the American Conservative Union, for not challenging commentator Van Jones during a panel at the Conservative Political Action Conference over Jones\u2019 accurate claim that \u201cundocumented immigrants right now have a lower crime rate than the rest of us.\u201d\n\u201cThe funniest part is that Matt Schlapp, CHAIRMAN OF THE ACU, just sat right next to Van Jones and didn\u2019t challenge this bullsh*t talking point,\u201d Goldy tweeted. \u201cThese people are so out of touch with the base.\u201d \nIt is correct that undocumented immigrants commit fewer crimes than native-born citizens in America. \nThere\u2019s also an easy explanation for why so many unauthorized immigrants wind up in federal prisons \u2014 the Justice Department spends more time prosecuting petty immigration violations than any other type of crime. Together, prosecutions for illegal entry (a misdemeanor) and illegal re-entry (a felony) have swallowed up roughly half of the federal criminal docket since 2008. \n(Meanwhile, federal prosecutions for white-collar crime have plummeted by more than 40 percent over the last two decades \u2015 despite the fact that some 9 million Americans lost their homes in the aftermath of the fraud-fueled financial crisis that began in late 2007.)\nKing\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday as to whether the congressman condones Goldy\u2019s views, whether an elected official should be amplifying the message of someone like Goldy, or whether he\u2019s concerned his views have once again aligned with those of neo-Nazis and white nationalists. \nIn January, King told The New York Times he didn\u2019t understand why the terms \u201cwhite supremacy\u201d and \u201cwhite nationalism\u201d were offensive. GOP leadership decided to punish King over his remarks, stripping him of his committee assignments. Many called on him to resign. \nBut King did not resign and has continued to make the dubious claim that his comments to The Times were taken out of context. \nAlso in January, HuffPost reported that King was still using his official government website to promote a white nationalist blog. The report led Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) to alert the House Ethics Committee over King\u2019s improper use of government property.\u00a0\nKing, who HuffPost has argued is a white supremacist, has previously promoted tweets by Mark Collett, a British neo-Nazi, and Lana Lokteff, a host for the white nationalist media outlet Red Ice.
