{"title": "Why The FBI Usually Doesn't Label Attacks By Non-Muslims Terrorism", "content": "Just hours after the FBI announced\u00a0that last week\u2019s politically motivated attack on members of Congress at a baseball practice was not an act of terrorism, federal investigators informed the public on Wednesday that the stabbing of a police officer at an airport in Flint, Michigan, potentially was.\nPolice said Amor Ftouhi, 50, attacked Lt. Jeff Neville of Bishop International Airport\u2019s Department of Public Safety on Wednesday morning. Ftouhi, a Quebec resident who entered the U.S. on June 16, yelled \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d before stabbing Neville, authorities said. He also \u201cexclaimed something similar\u201d to \u201dYou have killed people in Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan, and we are all going to die,\u201d according to an incident report.\nThe FBI\u2019s announcement in the Flint investigation followed revelations earlier Wednesday that the bureau had found no connection to terrorism in last week\u2019s shooting in Northern Virginia, during which James T. Hodgkinson opened fire on GOP lawmakers and staffers practicing for a charity baseball game. Hodgkinson, who was killed in a shootout with police, appeared politically motivated and regularly voiced strong sentiments against President Donald Trump on Facebook.\nBoth incidents would meet the textbook definition of terrorism: the \u201cunlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.\u201d \nThe FBI\u2019s own definition of domestic terrorism says an act must meet three characteristics: It must appear intended 1) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population, 2) to influence the policy of government by intimidation or coercion, 3) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping.\nBut there\u2019s no generic federal terrorism law that can be used in all acts that would meet the textbook definition. And when the FBI calls something terrorism, the organization is usually referring to a specific connection with a designated foreign terrorist organization. \nUnder federal law, it is much easier to deploy terrorism-related charges against individuals inspired by radical Islam, because even elements like retweets can be considered material support for a designated foreign terrorist organization. The U.S. does not label domestic extremist groups as terrorist organizations, as banning Americans from supporting U.S.-based organizations would raise First Amendment issues.\nThere are certain acts of terrorism that are illegal under federal law regardless of motivation. That includes airplane hijacking, the use of particular explosives and weapons, and assassinating a government official. But stabbings and shootings aren\u2019t included.\nTake the prosecution of Dylann Roof, who was sentenced to death this year for the shooting deaths of nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, in June 2015. Roof was found guilty on 33 counts, including hate crimes, but\u00a0he was not charged with terrorism. \nShortly after the Charleston attack, in July 2015, HuffPost pressed former FBI Director James Comey on the hesitancy to label the Charleston shooting as terrorism. Comey acknowledged the attack might fit the \u201ccolloquial\u201d definition of the word, but said he operated only in the legal framework, because of the nature of his job.\n\u201cThe only world I live in is when you bring charges against someone, and charge them with something under a particular provision that is a terrorism statute,\u201d Comey said. \u201cSo that\u2019s the framework through which I look at it.\u201d \nWhen Roof was indicted, Former Attorney General Loretta Lynch described hate crimes as the \u201coriginal domestic terrorism.\u201d She said\u00a0the lack of terrorism charges against Roof didn\u2019t mean the feds were taking the case any less seriously.\nLynch\u2019s predecessor, however, said it\u2019s time for the nation of reconsider what it labels as terrorism. Attorney General Eric Holder said Charleston should serve as a \u201dwake-up call\u2033 on domestic terrorism. People like Roof, he explained, can become radicalized on U.S. soil without the aid or influence of a foreign terror network. \n\u201cWe have a young man who apparently becomes radicalized as the result of an incident and becomes more radicalized as a result of what he sees on the Internet, through the use of his computer, then goes and does something, that by his own words apparently is a political-violent act,\u201d Holder told HuffPost. \u201cWith a different set of circumstances, and if you had dialed in religion there, Islam, that would be called an act of terror. It seems to me that, again on the basis of the information that has been released, that\u2019s what we have here. An act of terror.\u201d ", "date": "\n06/21/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/fbi-terrorism-label_n_594ae80ce4b0a3a837bcce51", "tags": "usually something \u201c fbi terrorism roof federal act label non-muslims attacks"}
