{"title": "Mueller Report Reveals Trump\u2019s Fixation on Targeting Hillary Clinton", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Attorney General Jeff Sessions had a tenuous hold on his job when President Trump called him at home in the middle of 2017. The president had already blamed him for recusing himself from investigations related to the 2016 election, sought his resignation and belittled him in private and on Twitter.\nNow, Mr. Trump had another demand: He wanted Mr. Sessions to reverse his recusal and order the prosecution of Hillary Clinton.\n\u201cThe \u2018gist\u2019 of the conversation,\u201d according to the report by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, quoting Mr. Sessions, \u201cwas that the president wanted Sessions to unrecuse from \u2018all of it.\u2019\u201d\nMr. Mueller\u2019s report released last week brimmed with examples of Mr. Trump seeking to protect himself from the investigation. But his request of Mr. Sessions \u2014 and two similar ones detailed in the report \u2014 stands apart because it shows Mr. Trump trying to wield the power of law enforcement to target a political rival, a step that no president since Richard M. Nixon is known to have taken.\nAnd at the time Mr. Trump pressured Mr. Sessions, the president was already under investigation for potentially obstructing justice and knew that his top aides and cabinet members were being interviewed in that inquiry.\nMr. Trump wanted Mrs. Clinton investigated for her use of a private email server to conduct government business while secretary of state, the report said, even though investigators had examined her conduct and declined to bring charges in a case closed in 2016.\nNo evidence has emerged that Mr. Sessions ever ordered the case reopened. Like many of Mr. Trump\u2019s aides, as laid out in the report and other accounts, Mr. Sessions instead declined to act, preventing Mr. Trump from crossing a line that might have imperiled his presidency.\nInstead, Mr. Sessions asked a  Justice Department official in November 2017 to review claims by the president and his allies about Mrs. Clinton and the F.B.I.\u2019s handling of the investigation into ties between Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia. The department\u2019s inspector general had already been scrutinizing the issues and painted a harsh portrait of the bureau in a report last year but found no evidence that politics had influenced the decision not to prosecute Mrs. Clinton.\nIt was unclear what effect the disclosures about Mr. Trump\u2019s discussions with Mr. Sessions could have on the president as House Democrats consider whether to move forward with impeachment proceedings.\nProsecutors, defense lawyers and legal experts largely agree that in the justice system, it is worse for innocent people to be prosecuted and jailed \u2014 thus deprived of their freedom \u2014 than for a guilty person to go free.\n\u201cThe loss of a case that should have been brought is never as bad as the harm of a case that shouldn\u2019t have been brought,\u201d said Samuel W. Buell, a professor of law at Duke University.\nThe report gave a detailed account of Mr. Trump\u2019s bids to wield power. Nine months into office in October 2017, he reminded Mr. Sessions in a private meeting that he believed the Justice Department was failing to investigate people who truly deserved scrutiny and mentioned Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails.\nTwo days later, Mr. Trump repeated his desires publicly, accusing law enforcement officials in a pair of tweets of \u201ca fix\u201d in the Clinton inquiry and asking, \u201cWhere is Justice Dept?\u201d\nA month later, Mr. Sessions found a way to satisfy Mr. Trump\u2019s demands without opening a new investigation into Mrs. Clinton. He told Congress that he had asked the United States attorney in Utah, John W. Huber, to examine the allegations Mr. Trump and his allies made about Mrs. Clinton and the F.B.I. No charges have arisen from that examination, which is continuing.\nBut Mr. Trump wanted more. He pulled Mr. Sessions aside after a cabinet meeting in December 2017 and \u201cagain suggested that Sessions could \u2018unrecuse,\u2019\u201d according to the report. A White House aide who witnessed the encounter believed Mr. Trump was talking about the since-closed Clinton investigation and the open Russia inquiry.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you could unrecuse yourself,\u201d Mr. Trump told Mr. Sessions, according to notes taken by the aide, Rob Porter. \u201cYou\u2019d be a hero. Not telling you to do anything.\u201d\nNoting that Alan Dershowitz, a prominent lawyer and informal adviser to Mr. Trump, said Mr. Trump had the power to order an investigation, the president took pains to suggest he was not trying to influence the attorney general.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to get involved. I\u2019m not going to get involved,\u201d the president said, according to Mr. Porter\u2019s notes. \u201cI\u2019m not going to do anything or direct you to do anything. I just want to be treated fairly.\u201d\nMr. Sessions replied that he was \u201ctaking steps\u201d and had a new leadership team in place at the F.B.I. \u201cProfessionals; will operate according to the law,\u201d Mr. Porter wrote in his notes, according to the special counsel\u2019s office.\nBy trying to have Mrs. Clinton prosecuted, Mr. Trump was following through on a campaign promise. At rallies, he often stood on stage denouncing her as crowds chanted, \u201cLock her up!\u201d\n\u201cThis reeks of a typical practice in authoritarian regimes where whoever attains power, they don\u2019t just take over power peacefully, but they punish and jail their opponents,\u201d said Matthew Dallek, a political historian and professor at George Washington University.\nThe report chronicled how Mr. Sessions fell further out of favor with Mr. Trump after he declined to commit to prosecuting Mrs. Clinton or to resume control of the Russia inquiry. Mr. Trump mixed private arm twisting with the bully pulpit of his Twitter account until he forced out Mr. Sessions in November.\n\u201cI put in an attorney general that never took control of the Justice Department, Jeff Sessions,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Fox News\u2019s \u201cFox & Friends\u201d in August 2018, according to the report.\nBeyond Mr. Mueller\u2019s report, there is evidence that Mr. Trump has continued to try to push the Justice Department to bend to his wishes. He told the White House counsel Donald F. McGahn II in April 2018 that he wanted the Justice Department to prosecute Mrs. Clinton and the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey, two people familiar with the conversation have said.\nMr. Mueller\u2019s report made no mention of the encounter with Mr. McGahn. He never conveyed the request to the Justice Department but had aides write Mr. Trump a memo that laid out the risks of impeachment or losing re-election if he took such a step.\nRudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, faulted the Obama administration for declining to prosecute Mrs. Clinton.\n\u201cIt was crying out for prosecution,\u201d said Mr. Giuliani, the former United States attorney in Manhattan. \u201cI could have prosecuted that case with my eyes closed.\u201d\nIt was unclear from the report whether Mr. Trump appreciated the difference between using his power to target Mrs. Clinton and trying to insulate himself from law enforcement scrutiny, Mr. Buell noted. It is more likely, he said, that Mr. Trump simply viewed the Justice Department and the F.B.I. as institutions that worked for him.\n\u201cAll of his demands fit into a picture that he believes the apparatus is mine,\u201d Mr. Buell said.\nMr. Trump has kept up the public lashings of law enforcement officials and Mrs. Clinton. \u201cThere are no Crimes by me at all,\u201d he wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. \u201cAll of the Crimes were committed by Crooked Hillary, the Dems, the DNC and Dirty Cops \u2014 and we caught them in the act!\u201d", "date": "April 24, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/24/us/politics/jeff-sessions-hillary-clinton-donald-trump.html", "tags": "sessions report hillary clinton \u201d trump fixation justice targeting reveals mrs. mueller"}
