{"title": "U.S. Ambassador to Mexico to Quit Amid Tense Relations Under Trump", "content": "MEXICO CITY \u2014 The United States ambassador to Mexico plans to resign from her post in May, according to a memo circulated on Thursday to embassy staff, the latest in a string of senior diplomatic departures from the region \u2014 and more broadly from the State Department.\nThe ambassador, Roberta S. Jacobson, 57, served just under two years in the post, after her arrival was delayed by a prolonged confirmation process. Analysts say her departure will be deeply felt by both American and Mexican officials \u2014 she was one of the most experienced Latin America experts in the State Department, having spent most of her 31 years there focusing on the region.\n\u201cI have come to the difficult decision that it is the right time to move on to new challenges and adventures,\u201d Mrs. Jacobson wrote in her letter. \u201cThis decision is all the more difficult because of my profound belief in the importance of the U.S.-Mexico relationship and knowledge that it is at a crucial moment.\u201d\nThe Trump administration has selected a nominee to fill Mrs. Jacobson\u2019s vacancy, but has not yet released the name, according to an American official with knowledge of the decision who was not authorized to comment publicly and who discussed the matter on the condition of anonymity.\nMrs. Jacobson leaves at a tense moment in relations between Mexico and the United States, with President Trump vowing to have Mexico pay to build a wall between the countries, pledging to tear up the North American Free Trade Agreement and promising to deport millions of Mexicans who crossed the border illegally.\nThere was also a testy phone call between Mr. Trump and President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico that derailed tentative plans for the two leaders to meet after Mr. Trump refused to drop his demand that Mexico pay for the border wall.\nFor Mrs. Jacobson, the ambassadorial post was the culmination of a career largely centered in Washington, where she was most recently the assistant secretary for Western Hemisphere affairs. As a member of the State Department\u2019s Civil Service \u2014 as opposed to the foreign service, which typically fills the ranks of diplomats \u2014 it was highly unusual for Mrs. Jacobson to have ascended to the top slot in Mexico.\nBut Mrs. Jacobson\u2019s supporters say her extensive experience and connections in the country were crucial assets for Washington at a time of strain between the two neighbors, which have closely intertwined economies.\nFormer President Barack Obama named Mrs. Jacobson to the post in 2015, but a bitter partisan dispute in Congress meant nearly 11 months elapsed before she was confirmed. After she arrived in Mexico City, the honeymoon period did not last long.\nMr. Trump\u2019s election abruptly changed the generally warm relations that the United States had developed with Mexico over the last 25 years \u2014 ones that Mrs. Jacobson had helped foster through much of her career. Mrs. Jacobson was left working with her Mexican counterparts to assuage growing concern \u2014 and anger \u2014 at the new president\u2019s tough talk.\nAt the same time, diplomacy on Mexico was being routed through the White House, via the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, which left Mrs. Jacobson with less authority.\nOfficials in Mexico, as well as former colleagues, lamented her departure, calling is the latest blow to strained Mexican-American relations.\n\u201cNo career official has more consummately understood U.S.-Mexico relations,\u201d said Carlos Pascual, a former American ambassador to Mexico and Ukraine. \u201cShe grounded American policy in the belief that, as neighbors, the U.S. and Mexico will gain most from using the vast resources of both countries to confront shared problems together.\u201d\nMrs. Jacobson will be leaving a State Department that has seen an exodus of foreign service officers.\nAmong those leaving are several high-ranking officials with deep experience in Latin America, including Thomas A. Shannon Jr., the third-highest ranking official in the State Department. Mr. Shannon, the under secretary of state for political affairs who previously served as an ambassador to Brazil, Guatemala and Venezuela, announced his retirement last month.\nWhile Mr. Shannon said his decision had been made for personal reasons, the departure of another official, John Feeley, the ambassador to Panama, was more politically tinged. In his resignation letter this year, Mr. Feeley said he was leaving a long career in the government service because he felt he could no longer serve Mr. Trump.\nIn her letter to staff, Mrs. Jacobson focused mostly on the work she and her team had done during her tenure, and did not take any shots at the president.\n\u201cYou have respected everyone you came in contact with \u2014 Mexican, American, or from anywhere else, reflecting the better angels of our nature,\u201d she wrote. \u201cYou know how great our two countries are. And that we are stronger together.\u201d\nMrs. Jacobson began her career at the State Department as a presidential management intern in 1986, during the Reagan administration, after graduating from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. Three years later she was transferred to the Western Hemisphere sector, where she remained for practically the rest of her career.\nHer interest in the area stemmed from the embrace of democracy that spread through the region in the 1980s, just as she was leaving college.\nShe served in numerous roles in Washington, including as deputy secretary for Western Hemisphere affairs for five years before she moved to Mexico, where she was a key broker in the agreement to re-establish relations between Cuba and the United States during the Obama administration.", "date": "March 1, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/01/world/americas/us-ambassador-mexico.html", "tags": "american relations tense ambassador u.s. department \u201d trump mexico mrs. state quit \u2014 jacobson amid"}
