{"title": "Microsoft Teaches Autonomous Gliders to Make Decisions on the Fly", "content": "HAWTHORNE, Nev. \u2014 As the glider turned and flew south, four men gave chase in a sport utility vehicle below, rolling through the Nevada desert.\nFrom the front seats, two of the men tracked the glider by sight. In the back, the other two followed the flight on their laptops, eyeballing data sent from the glider\u2019s tiny onboard computer and barking the figures into a walkie-talkie. In a Jeep up ahead, Ashish Kapoor listened as he, too, sped down the gravel road, eyes fixed on the white Styrofoam glider.\nSoon, the glider took another turn. It gently circled an invisible column of rising hot air while climbing slowly skyward. \u201cIt\u2019s soaring,\u201d Mr. Kapoor said, pointing at the glider as it spiraled higher and higher on a stream of warm air. \u201cIt found a thermal.\u201d\nLast week, in the desert valley surrounding Hawthorne, Nev., 130 miles south of Reno, Mr. Kapoor and his fellow Microsoft researchers tested two gliders designed to navigate the skies on their own. Guided by computer algorithms that learned from onboard sensors, predicted air patterns and planned a route forward, these gliders could seek out thermals \u2014 columns of rising hot air \u2014 and use them to stay aloft.\nThe hope is that the autonomous aircraft can eventually ride the air for hours or even days at a time while consuming very little power, helping to, say, track weather patterns, monitor farm crops or even deliver the internet to places where it\u2019s otherwise unavailable.\nLed by Mr. Kapoor, who is an artificial intelligence researcher and a licensed pilot, the project was part of a growing effort to build aircraft, automobiles and other machines that can make decisions on their own when faced with uncertainty \u2014 an essential skill for any machine trying to navigate the world on its own.\nUsing similar methods, Google has built high-altitude internet balloons that can stay aloft for months on end. Countless companies are designing cars that can drive on their own. And academics at schools like the University of California, Berkeley are developing everything from household robots that can perform seemingly simple but surprisingly complex tasks like making a bed to surgical robots that can handle some procedures on their own.\nCars, planes and other robots can now recognize the objects around them with an accuracy that rivals human sight thanks to the recent rise of neural networks, a term for mathematical systems that can learn certain tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data.\nBut that only gets them so far. To navigate the world on their own, they must also mimic the way humans intuitively predict what will happen next and adjust their behavior accordingly. Projects like those at Microsoft, Google and Berkeley are reaching in that direction.\nThis kind of research has become increasingly important as Google and many companies try to build driverless cars. Mykel Kochenderfer, a Stanford University professor of aeronautics and astronautics, said Microsoft\u2019s project was a step toward self-driving vehicles that are nimble enough to handle all the unexpected behavior that human drivers, bicyclists and pedestrians bring to public roads.\nIt was also a way of pushing the boundaries of the mathematical techniques that control a machine in a relatively safe but still very real environment. \u201cWith a glider, you can test these algorithms with minimal risk to people and property,\u201d Mr. Kochenderfer said.\nIn building their algorithms, Mr. Kapoor and his team relied on techniques that date back decades \u2014 something called Markov decision processes. Essentially, this is a way of identifying and responding to uncertainty.\nThe approach is like the one you take when looking for change in a backpack crammed with random stuff. If you just stick your hand in the bag and start rummaging around, you face enormous uncertainty. You don\u2019t know where to grab. But if, first, you remove the larger items like books and pencils that you know aren\u2019t coins, the change falls to the bottom and the task gets easier. That is what Microsoft\u2019s algorithms do \u2014 in a mathematical sense. They work to limit uncertainty, to reduce the scope of the problem.\nMr. Kapoor\u2019s team included Andrey Kolobov, a researcher who specializes in these methods.\nWhen he joined Microsoft\u2019s research group four years ago, Mr. Kolobov fed these ideas into the company\u2019s Windows operating system and its Bing search engine. Back then, he was dealing with uncertainty in the digital world. Now, he\u2019s applying them in the physical world. \u201cThe number of applications where these methods are used is growing,\u201d Mr. Kolobov said.\nIn the Nevada desert, the team launched its two gliders with help from a hand-held remote control. Once airborne, the gliders \u2014 or sailplanes \u2014 were left to their own devices. They were forced to fly with help from the wind and other air patterns.\nThrough those onboard algorithms, the gliders could analyze what was happening around them and then change directions as need be. They could learn from their environment, and although they could never be completely sure what would happen next, they could at least make educated guesses. Because it is dependent on phenomenon it has no control over, the glider must reason and plan in advance, Mr. Kolobov said.\nThe gliders planned their own paths to locations that could provide lift, and then they worked to exploit this lift, to ride those columns of rising air. When Mr. Kapoor pointed skyward from his Jeep, this is what happened. The math worked.\nStill, these aircraft were far from perfect. Using a fiberglass glider with a 16-foot wingspan, the team hoped to set a record for autonomous flight time by a sailplane \u2014 more than five hours aloft. But after two days of trial and error, thanks to problems with radios and other equipment, that didn\u2019t happen.\nThat researchers can improve on these sorts of learning algorithms has become an imperative to improving autonomous vehicles. To navigate the real world on their own, machines must mimic the way humans intuitively plan for their next action and deal with events they\u2019ve never before experienced.\n\u201cThe core problem for robotics is uncertainty,\u201d said Ken Goldberg, a professor at University of California, Berkeley. \u201cThis is what differentiates robotics from a game like Go or chess.\u201d\nOver the last two years, researchers at DeepMind, a London-based artificial intelligence lab owned by Google, used neural networks and other techniques to build a system that could beat the world\u2019s best players at Go, a game that is exponentially more difficult than chess. It was a milestone in the development of artificial intelligence. Now, researchers hope to reach bigger milestones here in the real world.\nThat\u2019s the big reason Microsoft is building autonomous gliders. As Mr. Kolobov put it: \u201cThe A.I. systems of tomorrow will face all the same challenges.\u201d", "date": "Aug. 16, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/16/technology/microsoft-teaches-autonomous-gliders-to-make-decisions-on-the-fly.html", "tags": "world autonomous make glider air gliders microsoft teaches \u201d could fly \u2014 kapoor decisions"}
