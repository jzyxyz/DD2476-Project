{"title": "Teachers Get Baseball Bats to Confront Shooters in Pennsylvania District", "content": "A school district in Erie, Pa., has supplied teachers and other school employees with miniature baseball bats to use as a last resort if confronted with an active shooter.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be sitting ducks,\u201d William Hall, superintendent of the Millcreek Township School District, said on Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re not just going to go hide.\u201d\nThe 18-inch wood bats are also meant to be \u201csymbolic,\u201d he said, to remind people that the old policy of simply turning off the lights, shutting the door and hiding, is not enough. Now, he says, one option is fighting back.\n\u201cPart of that response is to assess your environment for anything that could be used as a potential weapon or to defend yourself,\u201d he added.\nThe 600 bats each cost $3, Mr. Hall said, and are akin to a ballpark souvenir.\nThey are no match, of course, for a gunman toting a semiautomatic weapon.\nEven so, Mr. Hall said, \u201cI think a bat could disarm a pistol with a nice swing.\u201d\nJon Cacchione, the president of the Millcreek teachers\u2019 union, says it\u2019s better than doing nothing.\n\u201cIs this going to make the difference if we have an active shooter? I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, but the bats, along with the other changes the district is employing, are \u201can improvement of what we had before.\u201d\nThe Millcreek school district\u2019s decision to use bats has been panned on Facebook and Twitter, prompting comments ranging from angry to incredulous.\n\u201cIs this a late April fools joke?\u201d someone asked.\nOthers suggested that conceal and carry was a better solution.\n\u201cBest to just arm teachers and staff with guns,\u201d one woman wrote.\nBonnie Fagan, 56, a Pennsylvania PTA board member whose son graduated from the high school in Millcreek Township said she was \u201csurprised and disappointed to hear money was spent on something along those lines.\u201d\nMr. Hall defended his decision.\n\u201cI think what happens is, after Parkland, things die down and you almost fall back into a false sense of security until it happens again,\u201d Mr. Hall said. \u201cIf you have to take a few bumps and bruises because people think it\u2019s silly, I\u2019m O.K. with that.\u201d\nMatthew Exley, director of the Millcreek Township Office of Emergency Management, said in an email on Wednesday that neither his organization nor the Millcreek Township Police Department was involved in the decision by the Millcreek Township School District to provide bats to teachers.\nAll 470 of the district\u2019s teachers received the bats on April 2, as did teacher\u2019s aides, administrators and building staff, Mr. Cacchione said.\nThe idea came from an anonymous response to the district\u2019s online survey distributed about a month after the Parkland, Fla., shooting that killed 17 people, Mr. Hall explained. The survey, which included only one question, asked whether or not parents approved of having an armed presence in schools who would act as \u201c\u2018first responder(s)\u2019 to an active shooter situation.\u201d\nThe bats are meant to be used only during a \u201chard lockdown situation,\u201d Mr. Hall said, and are locked up in the district\u2019s buildings and classrooms so they don\u2019t fall into the wrong hands.\nIt\u2019s part of a larger effort to improve school safety, Mr. Hill said, that includes installing a concrete barrier between a parking lot and a walkway, instituting regular police patrols at each of the district\u2019s 10 schools and securing building entrances.\nThe Parkland shooting has led school officials and lawmakers across the country to make changes. Last month, the superintendent of the Blue Mountain School District in Schuylkill County, Pa., announced that every classroom had been equipped with a five-gallon bucket of river stone.\n\u201cIf an armed intruder attempts to gain entrance to any of our classrooms, they will face a classroom full students armed with rocks and they will be stoned,\u201d the superintendent, David Helsel, said at the time.\nAnd last month Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where the mass shooting took place in February, announced that it would require students to wear clear backpacks.\nThe Pattonville School District in Missouri is spending $4.3 million on safety and security upgrades, according to The St. Louis Post-Dispatch.\nAnd the Florida Legislature passed a gun control bill on March 7 that would allow superintendents and sheriffs to arm school personnel. But that move was rejected on Tuesday by the school board in Broward County, Fla.\nAnd while Mr. Cacchione said that bats aren\u2019t going to stop an active shooter, \u201cwe\u2019re going to keep working at this until we get what\u2019s best.\u201d", "date": "April 11, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/11/us/erie-bats-school-shooting.html", "tags": "confront baseball shooters \u201d teachers school millcreek hall district bats get pennsylvania"}
