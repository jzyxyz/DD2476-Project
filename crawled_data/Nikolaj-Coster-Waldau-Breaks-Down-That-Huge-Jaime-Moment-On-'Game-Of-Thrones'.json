{"title": "Nikolaj Coster-Waldau Breaks Down That Huge Jaime Moment On 'Game Of Thrones'", "content": "Warning! Spoilers ahead for \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d Season 7!\u00a0\nDuring the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d Season 7 finale, fans witnessed a meetup of all their favorite characters, an incestuous, butt-friendly sex scene and an ice dragon destroying the Wall.\nBut a lot of attention was centered on another big moment: Jaime Lannister\u2019s decision to leave Cersei and join the Northerners\u2019 fight against the Night King.\u00a0\nHe did it, y\u2019all \u2015 Jaime finally realized his sister is crazy.\u00a0\nActor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who\u2019s played Jaime on screen for seven years, was thrilled to know his character used his brain for once and saw right through Cersei\u2019s (Lena Headey) lies. After she meets with Tyrion (Peter Dinklage) following the dragon pit council, everyone assumes Cersei had a change of heart when she reemerges to tell them she will join the fight against the dead and send her army north. Even her dear brother/lover (and the father of her unborn child) falls for it.\u00a0\nBut we all know Cersei, and she\u2019s not one to play nice. As Jaime gears up to lead the Lannister troops north, Cersei interrupts to share her true motive: betraying Jon Snow (Kit Harington) and Daenerys (Emilia Clarke) by staying in the South as they face the Great War. Cersei and\u00a0Euron Greyjoy (Pilou Asb\u00e6k) actually plotted to buy an elite mercenary troop of over 20,000 men in Essos called the Golden Company and plan on continuing Cersei\u2019s rule on the Iron Throne.\nJaime was shook, so he decides to finally bite the bullet and say goodbye to his twin. She, of course, threatens to kill him \u2015 as she did with Tyrion earlier on in the episode \u2015 but Jaime somehow escapes with his head after the Mountain doesn\u2019t obey Cersei\u2019s apparent \u201cgo for it\u201d signal. (She is definitely, maybe, pissed about that.)\nBelow, Coster-Waldau discusses Jaime\u2019s big exit from King\u2019s Landing, his hopes to reunite with Bran Stark, and his love of Tormund and Brienne.\u00a0\nJaime finally did what fans have been waiting for: He left Cersei. You\u2019re free! What did you think of this moment?\nHe hadn\u2019t finished decorating the new nursery, which really upset me.\nI know he left Cersei behind with his unborn child.\nTypical guy, you know? They have this beautiful relationship and then she says she\u2019s pregnant, and he\u2019s out the door. Can you believe it?!\nNo, that was a great scene, really, because we\u2019ve been waiting for that moment a long time. There were so many other times when I thought that would be it, time for him to pack his bags, but I guess she finally took it one step too far. He saw what he saw, and he understood the threat [of the dead], and he understood that clearly if they don\u2019t all work together, they don\u2019t stand a chance. And the fact that he knows his sister saw and recognized the same threat and her calculations led her to the exact opposite result \u2014 it\u2019s just shocking. I don\u2019t know why it took him so long to realize what the rest of the world always knew \u2014 that she is a crazy monster \u2014 but he finally did. And then he left.\nNot going to lie, I thought this might have been your demise. The Mountain was ready to kill you! But you called her bluff.\nCersei had the chance with both her brothers to kill them and she was threatening to do so, but both times she eased off on the trigger. I get that with Tyrion she was setting him up for failure \u2015 making him believe that he was the hero of the day, that he negotiated this amazing support from the Lannister army and what a wonderful thing he did. So that makes sense. For Jaime, I would think he would think there was part of her that still understands that he really is the last person that she has. That is the truth; that must resonate somewhere inside her. That would help. Or maybe the Mountain is just so thick that he didn\u2019t get the eye signal. Maybe there\u2019s a scene right after where she goes, \u201cWhy the fuck didn\u2019t you kill him?! I gave you the signal!\u201d I don\u2019t know. Who knows. We\u2019ll never know because that scene isn\u2019t there, but that might be the case. Maybe she\u2019s not so afraid of the undead, because she already has the Mountain, who\u2019s undead, and she likes that she can control him.\nAh, she\u2019s a Night Queen herself with the Mountain.\nYeah, that\u2019s going to be the thing.\u00a0\nWhen Jaime tells her \u201cI don\u2019t believe you,\u201d is it about her killing him, her pregnancy or just her scheming in general? How did you interpret that line?\nIs \u201cI don\u2019t believe you\u201d saying \u201cI don\u2019t love you\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t believe I\u2019m going to die.\u201d My subjects as an actor was \u201cThis is it. I don\u2019t believe in you anymore. I don\u2019t believe in this, you and me. I don\u2019t love you anymore.\u201d That\u2019s how I played it. Now, I\u2019ve done that before and then you find out that\u2019s not what they intended, but, you know, that was kind of my intention that that was it. She\u2019s obviously always going to be a huge part of him and there won\u2019t be a day where he won\u2019t be thinking of Cersei because \u2015 just like Tyrion is thinking about his father [Tywin] every day and his niece [Myrcella] and his nephew [Tommen] who would\u2019ve been alive if it wasn\u2019t for him \u2015 it\u2019s the same for Jaime. Cersei is always going to be there. He\u2019s going to have so many hours of the day with a therapist from now on and every time it\u2019s going to be back to Cersei. I think the whole \u201cI\u2019m in love with you\u201d thing is not really there \u2014 it\u2019s gone. But I may be wrong, who knows?\nWill Jaime head straight to Tyrion?\nI think he\u2019s going North to join up with Jon Snow and the folks up there.\nYou\u00a0told HuffPost you wanted Jaime and Jon to be BFFs, so this could be the time.\nWouldn\u2019t that be nice? Well, it\u2019s not Jon anymore, it\u2019s Aegon Targaryen. So I actually killed his grandfather [Aerys] \u2014 so I killed her father and his grandfather. It\u2019s going to be such a wonderful reunion. [Laughs] The one thing that would be cool \u2014 I would love Jaime to meet Bran Stark. If nothing else just to say, \u201cSorry, kid.\u201d And then Bran can say, \u201cNo, don\u2019t worry. If you hadn\u2019t done that I wouldn\u2019t be the all-seeing Three-Eyed Raven. And Jaime could go, \u201cOh, great! Well, good.\u201d Imagine if that happened to your brother or a relative, like that guy who\u2019s always a little quiet at the family parties? Then you realize it\u2019s because he knows everything! But if you know everything, shouldn\u2019t you tell us? Don\u2019t keep it to yourself, just spread information. Let\u2019s find out what\u2019s going on!\nBran waited the whole season to tell anyone in his family about Jon\u2019s true parentage.\nSamwell Tarly comes in and he says what he says and then the Three-Eyed Raven doesn\u2019t know that Jon Snow is actually Aegon Targaryen but Samwell says so and then he just suddenly finds outs. I didn\u2019t understand that.\nHe\u2019s like, \u201cOh, let me just hop in that vision real quick.\u201d\nHe has so much information in his brain, he has to use the search button. How does it work?! He didn\u2019t know until Samwell came and said, \u201cNo, no, I read this thing.\u201d And then he goes into a trance and he sees it. It must have been on a hard drive that he doesn\u2019t access usually and then suddenly \u2026 it\u2019s Siri! He has to have Siri! \u201cSiri, look up Jon Snow. No, look up whatever that was.\u201d\nIt was a great sequence. It\u2019s beautiful they cut to that and then Jon and Daenerys having sex because I feel like, on behalf of the original twincest couple, it was a beautiful irony that their story turned out to be aunt and nephew.\nYes, you passed the baton.\n[Laughs] So Dany is fucking the nephew. I thought that was a beautiful moment in \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d history.\nI think it\u2019s going to mess things up, royally, but we\u2019ll see.\nYeah, I know.\nSo, Jaime started the episode off with Bronn, but ended it solo. You left your buddy behind?\nI don\u2019t know! Yeah, c\u2019mon, why would anyone leave Bronn behind with Cersei? I mean, she doesn\u2019t seem to be a big fan of Bronn. She really played him as well, along with everyone else, but maybe Bronn becomes Cersei\u2019s right-hand man. Or, maybe he still was coming [North], he just hung out with Podrick and Tyrion. But we didn\u2019t see him when they went to Dragonstone. Maybe he\u2019ll show up \u2014 I\u2019ll meet him at the war.\nJaime also shared a moment with Brienne, who seems to still be a moral compass for him. Are you glad they might be reuniting in war, too?\nI think we should team up. After I saw Episode 6, I\u2019m so rooting for Tormund Giantsbane and Brienne of Tarth to become a couple. She needs to go with someone who wants her instead of always \u2026 the Jaime-Brienne thing was never going to happen. He\u2019s too messed up. She should go with Tormund because he is so in love with her. Maybe he\u2019s coming on too hard because he\u2019s already talking about babies and all that, but I think that\u2019s the one for her.\nShe might want what she can\u2019t have, though.\nI don\u2019t think she ever wanted [Jaime]. I think that she liked him and they respected each other, but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s ever looked at Jaime the way Tormund looks at her. There\u2019s never been that kind of beautiful lustful relationship between Jaime and Brienne. It\u2019s been more like an emotional connection. I don\u2019t see it happening. I think Jaime is truly damaged goods, anyone should stay away from him. His twin sister is always going to be there \u2014 it\u2019s going to be weird.\nWell, you both still have Valryian steel, so you can be together on the battlefield and fight the Night King\u2019s army.\nI know. I hope I get to have some scenes with Gwendoline [Christie] again because she\u2019s so much fun to be around and she\u2019s great. But in terms of story, it doesn\u2019t makes sense for them to be a couple. But who knows?\nKing\u2019s Landing was on fire when you returned at the end of Season 6. When you left in the Season 7 finale, it was snowing. Significance there?\nThe significance is we see the snow coming and we see, of course, the Night King breaking through the wall. The whole thing from the beginning has been winter is coming. Even down South they thought, \u201cOh, well, we don\u2019t have to worry about that.\u201d Now it\u2019s set up for the war is here and there\u2019s no escaping it. It\u2019s going to get really messy, really fast.\nGet your snow plows ready for sure, because winter is here.\nIt\u2019s that weird thing where you know they\u2019re ready for it up North, but I have a feeling in King\u2019s Landing it\u2019s just going to be a mess because they\u2019re not ready for it and they have this arrogance about them. It\u2019s like when it rains in LA, everything just comes to a standstill.\nI can\u2019t wait for next season. I hope it won\u2019t take too long.\nIt\u2019s just going to be a couple of years.
