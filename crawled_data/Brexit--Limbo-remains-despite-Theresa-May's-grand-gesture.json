{"title": "Brexit: Limbo remains despite Theresa May's grand gesture", "content": "When a lot happens, sometimes we know less.\nThe prime minister offered to pay the ultimate political price, and leave office - the grandest of gestures any leader ever really has.\nFor a moment it seemed it might work and line up the support she so desperately needs. \nBut within a couple of hours her allies in Northern Ireland were refusing to unblock the progress of Theresa May's main mission.\nThat might not be terminal - one cabinet minister told me the PM may yet have another go at pushing her deal through Parliament against the odds on Friday.\nBut if Plan A fails, Parliament is not ready with a clear Plan B that could yet succeed. \nFor fans of a closer trading relationship within the EU than Theresa May's negotiated, there is evidence a customs union could grow to find a majority in the House of Commons. \nThose arguing for another referendum too were cheered by the support MPs displayed. \nBut if it's Parliament's route, not the prime minister's, that prevails; a quick resolution is out of reach for now.\nFor our politics, for businesses trying to make decisions, for all of us, divisions and tensions between and inside our government - and our Parliament - are too profound to bring this limbo to an end. \nHear Laura with Europe editor Katya Adler, Brussels reporter Adam Fleming and political correspondent Chris Mason on the latest Brexitcast on BBC Sounds.", "date": "28 March 2019", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-47728949", "tags": "brexit support may despite minister gesture theresa within prime might parliament grand political limbo yet remains"}
