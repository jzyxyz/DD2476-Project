It\u2019s that simple,\u201d Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in announcing a policy that will impose potential criminal penalties on border crossers who previously faced mainly civil deportation proceedings \u2014 and in the process, force the separation of families crossing the border for months or longer.\nThe new policy could flood the immigration courts, already suffering severe backlogs, and create new detention space shortages for federal agencies that even now have been forced to release many undocumented immigrants until their cases can be heard. Mr. Sessions said he has dispatched 35 additional prosecutors and 18 immigration judges to the Southwest border region to help handle expanding caseloads.\nThe stepped-up enforcement strategy marks the Trump administration\u2019s toughest move yet to stem the flow of migrants into the United States, though officials said the category of migrants accounting for much of the recent surge, those seeking asylum from violence in Central America, will still be able to apply for legal refuge.\n\u201cToday we\u2019re here to send a message to the world that we are not going to let the country be overwhelmed. People are not going to caravan or otherwise stampede our border,\u201d Mr. Sessions said in the second of a pair of announcements in Arizona and California.\nThe new policy strikes squarely at parents who have traveled with their children, some apparently with the expectation that they would face shorter periods of detention while their cases were heard.\n\u201cIf you are smuggling a child then we will prosecute you, and that child will be separated from you as required by law,\u201d Mr. Sessions said at a law enforcement conference in Scottsdale, Ariz. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like that, then don\u2019t smuggle children over our border.\u201d\nThe new initiative will result in referring all illegal Southwest border crossings to the Justice Department for prosecution, Mr. Sessions said, and federal prosecutors will file charges in as many cases as possible \u201cuntil we get to 100 percent.\u201d\nUnder current law, anyone crossing illegally into the country can be prosecuted, and the penalties are even stiffer if they attempt to enter the country after they have been deported. In most cases, though, first-time offenders are simply put into civil deportation proceedings. While it is unlikely that Mr. Sessions\u2019 goal of 100 percent prosecutions will be achieved, officials at the Department of Homeland Security say they want to significantly increase the number of people referred for criminal prosecution.\n\u201cWhat is notable about this is that they are taking into criminal proceedings first\u2013time crossers, which has generally not been the case in the past,\u201d said Doris Meissner, senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute, who served as immigration commissioner during the Clinton administration.\nA similar zero-tolerance policy was attempted in 2005 in parts of Texas and Arizona under the George W. Bush administration, which ordered criminal prosecutions of immigrants in those areas who entered the country illegally. The policy lasted into the Obama administration before it was scaled back.\nAnother pilot prosecution project was implemented in the El Paso area at the beginning of the 2017 fiscal year. The number of illegal crossings of families dropped by 64 percent, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, who said entries began rising again after the initiative ended.\nDuring the first six months of the fiscal year 2018, there were 35,787 criminal prosecutions for immigration violations, according to data from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a research group at Syracuse University. If prosecutions continue at that pace for the rest of the year, it would be a 19.5 percent increase in prosecutions compared to fiscal 2017, the American Immigration Council said.\nThe proposal has been in discussion for some time by top officials at the Department of Homeland Security.\nUnder the directive, undocumented immigrants who are stopped by the Border Patrol or customs officers will be sent directly to a federal court by the United States Marshals Service. Children will be placed in the custody of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of Refugee Resettlement, administration officials said.\nThe adult immigrants would be sent to detention centers to await trial. If convicted, they would be imprisoned for the duration of their sentences, after which time they could be returned to their countries of origin. First-time illegal entry is a misdemeanor that carries up to a six-month prison sentence. Repeat entry constitutes a felony and carries a penalty of up to two years imprisonment.\nAfter a lull, the number of women and children making the perilous journey over land from Central America to the United States has spiked. Many of them are fleeing gangs, which often try to recruit their children. Honduras, the source of many of the migrants, has among the world\u2019s highest murder rate.\nThe number of border apprehensions totaled 50,924 in April 2018 compared with 15,766 the same month last year. But the 2018 figure was roughly the same as that of April 2016, suggesting that 2017 was an outlier.\nLast month, nearly 10,000 people traveling in families were apprehended at the border, and almost 50,000 have been arrested since October, the start of the fiscal year.\n\u201cRight now we are dealing with a massive influx of illegal aliens across our Southwest border. In April we saw triple the number from last April,\u201d said Mr. Sessions. \u201cBut we\u2019re not going to stand for this.\u201d\nBut the overall flow of undocumented immigrants remains low compared to previous years.\nIn fiscal year 2017, the Border Patrol apprehended 303,916 people compared to 408,870 in fiscal 2016, 331,333 in 2015 and 479,371 in fiscal 2014.\n\u201cYes, we have this spike in Central Americans. But the overall undocumented flow is at historic lows,\u201d said Seth Stodder, a former assistant secretary of Homeland Security in the Obama administration who also served as policy director for Customs and Border Protection during the Bush administration.\n\u201cWe are not facing a \u2018massive influx\u2019 of undocumented migrants coming across the US-Mexico border. In fact, the opposite is true \u2014 undocumented migrant crossings are at historic lows, with border apprehensions around 20 percent of what they were around the time of the 9/11 attacks,\u201d Mr. Stodder said.\nUnder United States and international law, asylum seekers are afforded the opportunity to seek protection, and the overloaded immigration courts are not up to the challenge, he added. \u201cBrutally separating young children from their parents is not a response worthy of a great and humane nation,\u201d Mr. Stodder said.\nThe Trump administration already had hinted that a policy of separating migrant children from their parents was under consideration as a means of deterrence.\nOfficials have insisted no such policy is in place, though about 700 children, including 100 children four years old and younger, have been separated from their parents since October, according to the Department of Health and Human Services refugee office.\nThe new policy will surely increase this number.\nLeaders of a caravan of migrants that recently arrived at the California-Mexico border and that President Trump has vowed to keep from entering the country were critical of the new policy.\n\u201cThe U.S. Government is waging a war on refugee families that has reached a new level of heartlessness and hate,\u201d said Alex Mensing, a spokesman for the organizing group, from Pueblo Sin Fronteras.\n\u201cSessions\u2019 attack on the rights of refugees violates both U.S. law and international agreements, not to mention the spirit of welcoming those fleeing violence and in need of refuge,\u201d he added. \u201cRefugee parents aren\u2019t smuggling their children, they\u2019re saving their lives.\u201d\nJenna Gilbert, a managing attorney in Los Angeles for Human Rights First, a nonprofit that represents asylum seekers and other immigrants, accused the administration of attempting to frighten people out of seeking a safe haven in the United States.\n\u201cSeparating mothers and children at the border is just another example of the administration\u2019s cruelty and attempts to scare or deter people from seeking asylum, \u201c Ms. Gilbert said.\nHowever, immigrants seeking asylum still could be protected, the officials said. The new policy, meant to deter illegal immigration, would not apply to people who present themselves at ports of entry seeking asylum.\nIn cases where migrants who have illegally entered the United States express fear of returning to their home country because of political prosecution or other dangers, Customs and Border Protection officers can refer them to asylum interviews.\nOther critics warned that the new policy is logistically unworkable.\n\u201cIf they try to prosecute all these folks for illegal immigration it will overwhelm the federal courts,\u201d said Royce Murray, policy director at the American Immigration Council, a nonprofit group in Washington.", "date": "May 7, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/07/us/politics/homeland-security-prosecute-undocumented-immigrants.html", "tags": "southwest administration policy sessions immigration threatens jail parents border trump separating children new cross illegally said"}
