{"title": "How An Old Prophecy Complicates Cersei's Bombshell Reveal On 'Game Of Thrones'", "content": "WARNING! Spoilers ahead for \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d Season 7!\nSunday\u2019s whirlwind \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d episode took viewers from the Reach to King\u2019s Landing to Dragonstone to the North to even further north \u2015 and back a couple times.\nIn all the commotion, it may have been easy to overlook Cersei\u2019s (Lena Headey) big reveal: She\u2019s pregnant with another child by her brother Jaime (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau). (Pause for: Ew.)\nAfter his surprise meeting with Tyrion (Peter Dinklage) in Season 7\u2032s Episode 5, \u201cEastwatch,\u201d Jaime returns to the Lannister queen\u2019s chambers to share what he learned. Just before he walks in, we hear Qyburn distantly offering, \u201cI could give you something,\u201d and Cersei\u2019s reply, \u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary.\u201d Jaime then tells her about the tentative truce proposed by Tyrion, in light of the White Walkers\u2019\u00a0imminent arrival in the Seven Kingdoms, and she seems open to the idea, thanks in no small part to the idea of a new child.\n\u201cDead men, dragons and dragon queens \u2015 whatever stands in our way, we will defeat it. For ourselves, for our house, for this,\u201d she says, gesturing to her stomach.\u00a0Over the course of seven seasons, oftentimes Cersei\u2019s only redeeming quality has been the love and devotion she\u2019s shown her children, and the deaths of Joffrey, Myrcella and Tommen have made her more vengeful than ever. A new child could change her outlook.\u00a0\nBut according to her childhood prophecy, Cersei will only have three children \u2015 not four.\u00a0\nBack\u00a0in Season 5, a flashback showed a young Cersei venturing into the woods with a friend to hear her future told by Maggy the Frog, who delivers three predictions that since came true:\nIf Maggy\u2019s prophecy has been accurate thus far, it\u2019s hard to imagine Cersei\u2019s unborn child will come to term, suggesting she might not be long for the world of Westeros.\nAnd a fan on Reddit has a pretty compelling idea on how, exactly, she might die.\nIt goes back to George R.R. Martin\u2019s\u00a0\u201cSong of Ice and Fire\u201d book series, which includes another line in Maggy\u2019s prophecy:\nValonqar, or \u201clittle brother,\u201d partially explains Cersei\u2019s hatred of Tyrion; she seems convinced that he is the little brother who will \u201cchoke the life\u201d from her. Her twin, Jaime, is also fractionally younger than Cersei, though, and many fans believe he will be the one to kill her if her appetite for vengeance goes too far.\u00a0\nBut on Reddit, a user named Bloreactivist explained\u00a0how the \u201clittle brother\u201d could actually refer to Cersei and Jaime\u2019s new child \u2015 who, if it\u2019s a boy, would be the younger brother of their other three children. That \u201clittle brother\u201d might then kill Cersei in childbirth and not survive, himself, allowing the prophecy to stand fulfilled.\nMelisandre made a pointed observation earlier in Season 7 about prophecies in the world of ice and fire \u2015 they\u2019re slippery, and it can be dangerous to take them too literally. But in the game of thrones, valar morgulis \u2015 all men must die \u2015 and this would be a pretty poetic way for Cersei to meet her end.\n\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d airs Sundays at 9 p.m. ET on HBO.", "date": "\n08/14/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-a-prophecy-complicates-cerseis-bombshell-reveal-on-game-of-thrones_n_5991b3a6e4b08a247275fb0f", "tags": "cersei game reveal season bombshell \u201d \u2015 complicates child old brother thrones jaime prophecy"}
