{"title": "Trump Tariffs Spare Clothing Industry -- Including Ivanka's Chinese-Made Products", "content": "President\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0enacted tariffs Friday morning on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods, affecting hundreds of products from boats to medical devices and auto parts.\u00a0But the clothing industry was mostly spared from the tariffs, meaning Ivanka Trump\u2019s foreign-made products for her fashion line will be unaffected.\nWhile Trump rails at Harley-Davidson motorcycles for moving some production to Europe to dodge EU tariffs, the first daughter and senior White House adviser has never manufactured a single product for her Ivanka Trump brand on American soil.\nAnd for now,\u00a0it seems Chengdu Kameido Shoes in Sichuan province can continue to supply shoes for the Ivanka Trump brand as it has in the past. It\u2019s currently bidding for a new contract to manufacture 140,000 pairs of shoes for Trump\u2019s company, a spokesman told The South China Morning Post.\nHangzhou HS Fashion in Zhejiang province also said it\u2019s filling orders for orders for the G-III Apparel Group,\u00a0which supplies shoes to Trump\u2019s brand.\nUntil January 2017 all of Ivanka Trump\u2019s products were made in factories in China and Hong Kong, research director Chris Rogers at Panjiva, a global trade data tracking company headquartered in New York, told Politico. Since then, some manufacturing has apparently been moved to other overseas factories in Indonesia, South Korea and Vietnam. (That\u2019s not out of line with overall industry trends \u2015\u00a0in 2016, over a third of clothing imports to the U.S. came from China,\u00a0but a growing percentage were coming from other countries like Vietnam.)\nThere have been no obvious shipments from China since mid-March, but Rogers speculated shipments may now be more difficult to trace because they could be moving under code names.\nOther enterprises and workers in the U.S., meanwhile, are already feeling the heat from a trade war. China\u2019s retaliatory tariffs have targeted U.S. seafood, soybeans, dairy products, cars, apples, whiskey, pet food and cigarettes, among several other products. Farmers are fearful they won\u2019t be able to sell products they had earmarked for China. They also worry that suppliers from other countries will pick up the valuable market \u2014 for good \u2014 that they have worked for years to cultivate.\n\u201cSoybeans are the top agriculture export for the United States, and China is the top market for purchasing those exports,\u201d\u00a0Iowa soybean grower John Heisdorffer said in a\u00a0statement. \u201cThe math is simple. You tax soybean exports at 25 percent, and you have serious damage to U.S. farmers.\u201d\u00a0\nDespite the president\u2019s mantra to \u201cbuy American and hire American\u201d the Trump family retains major business operations overseas, and the Trump Organization continues to manufacture most Trump products in foreign factories.\nThe president even continues to profit from partnerships involving the Chinese government\u00a0through state-supported companies and investments, including in developments in Dubai and Indonesia, notes the Washington Post. Ivanka Trump won a number of valuable trademarks in China just as her father was pushing to lift U.S. sanctions against Chinese telecom company ZTE,\u00a0over the objection of congressional leaders. Trump announced his support for ZTE 72 hours after the Chinese government agreed to put\u00a0half-a-billion dollars into the Indonesian project. The deal raised \u201cserious ethical issues,\u201d the head of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics said.\nClarification:\u00a0The headline and text in this story has been updated to include more information about the tariffs and the clothing industry, and to clarify that Ivanka Trump\u2019s Chinese-made products are not the only ones in the industry not facing tariffs.", "date": "\n07/09/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-china-tariffs-spares-clothing-shoes-ivanka-safe_n_5b42a597e4b09e4a8b2e72c3", "tags": "china ivanka u.s. clothing trump including -- industry chinese chinese-made products shoes tariffs spare"}
