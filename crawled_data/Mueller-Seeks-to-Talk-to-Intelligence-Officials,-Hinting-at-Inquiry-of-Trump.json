{"title": "Mueller Seeks to Talk to Intelligence Officials, Hinting at Inquiry of Trump", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel examining Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election, has requested interviews with three high-ranking current or former intelligence officials, the latest indication that he will investigate whether President Trump obstructed justice, a person briefed on the investigation said on Wednesday.\nMr. Mueller wants to question Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence; Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the head of the National Security Agency; and Richard Ledgett, the former N.S.A. deputy director.\nNone of the men were involved with Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. But recent news reports have raised questions about whether Mr. Trump requested their help in trying to get James B. Comey, then the F.B.I. director, to end an investigation into the president\u2019s former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn. Last week, Mr. Coats and Admiral Rogers declined to answer questions before Congress about the matter.\nMr. Mueller\u2019s office has also asked the N.S.A. for any documents or notes related to the agency\u2019s interactions with the White House as part of the Russia investigation, according to an intelligence official.\nThe Washington Post first reported on Wednesday that Mr. Mueller had requested the interviews with the intelligence officials.\nIt has been clear since Mr. Mueller was appointed last month that he was likely to scrutinize the president\u2019s actions. Mr. Trump has said he is willing to be interviewed by Mr. Mueller\u2019s agents, and Mr. Comey said he was sure that the special counsel would investigate the possibility of obstruction.\nIn recent days, Mr. Trump is said to have considered firing Mr. Mueller but to have been talked out of it by aides. If the president is under investigation for obstruction, a move to fire Mr. Mueller would prove more complicated politically.\nThe F.B.I.\u2019s gathering information about the possibility of a crime does not necessarily mean prosecutors are building a case against the president. In the early stages of investigations, F.B.I. agents typically want to gather all the facts. Agents then present those facts to prosecutors, who decide whether they want to take the case.\nMr. Mueller\u2019s requests are among his first publicly known acts since he took over the investigation last month, after it was publicly revealed that Mr. Comey had written a memo about how Mr. Trump asked him to halt the inquiry into his fired national security adviser, Mr. Flynn.\nIn testimony on Capitol Hill last week, Mr. Comey said Mr. Mueller had a copy of that memo and several others Mr. Comey had written about his interactions with Mr. Trump.\nA spokeswoman for the White House referred all questions on the matter to Mr. Trump\u2019s outside lawyer, Marc E. Kasowitz. A spokesman for Mr. Kasowitz said, \u201cThe F.B.I. leak of information regarding the president is outrageous, inexcusable and illegal.\u201d\nThe scrutiny of Mr. Trump\u2019s actions is part of a ripple of unintended consequences that began when the president, frustrated by the cloud of investigations into Russian collusion, fired Mr. Comey last month. \u201cWhen I decided to just do it, I said to myself \u2014 I said, \u2018You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump told NBC. He then said: \u201cI might even lengthen out the investigation, but I have to do the right thing for the American people. He\u2019s the wrong man for that position.\u201d\nThe White House could try to assert executive privilege to keep the intelligence officials from discussing conversations between them and the president with Mr. Mueller. But that could set up a fight in court, where judges have generally held that criminal investigators can demand information that would normally be privileged.\nIn his memos, Mr. Comey said Mr. Trump had encouraged him to end an F.B.I. investigation into Mr. Flynn, an effort that Mr. Comey called \u201cvery disturbing.\u201d There is a broad federal inquiry underway into Mr. Flynn\u2019s actions. Among the issues being examined are whether he misled investigators about his ties to Russia, and his failure to disclose that he was working as a foreign agent of Turkey from August to November 2016: the same time he was advising the Trump campaign.\nThe Justice Department appointed Mr. Mueller last month to investigate whether members of the Trump campaign colluded with Russian operatives to influence the outcome of last year\u2019s presidential election. Mr. Mueller inherited the criminal investigations into Mr. Flynn and Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort. He was also given the authority to investigate obstruction.\nWhile Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, has not said what exactly prompted him to appoint Mr. Mueller, his decision came after The New York Times published details about an Oval Office meeting Mr. Comey had with the president at the White House in February. During the meeting, the president brought up Mr. Flynn and told Mr. Comey, \u201cI hope you can let this go,\u201d according to the memo. Mr. Comey told the Senate that he viewed that as a clear directive from the president to drop the investigation.\nA former senior official said Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation was looking at money laundering by Trump associates. The suspicion is that any cooperation with Russian officials would most likely have been in exchange for some kind of financial payoff, and that there would have been an effort to hide the payments, probably by routing them through offshore banking centers.", "date": "June 14, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/14/us/politics/mueller-trump-special-counsel-investigation.html", "tags": "intelligence officials inquiry seeks comey president investigation trump last flynn russia hinting talk mueller"}
