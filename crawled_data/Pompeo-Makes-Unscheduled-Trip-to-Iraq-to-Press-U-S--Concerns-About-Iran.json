{"title": "Pompeo Makes Unscheduled Trip to Iraq to Press U.S. Concerns About Iran", "content": "BAGHDAD \u2014 Secretary of State Mike Pompeo scrapped a visit to Germany on Tuesday to make an unannounced trip to Iraq, pressing Iraqi leaders about what he called the increased dangers to Americans there from Iran\u2019s forces and allies.\nMr. Pompeo said he also used the four-hour visit to push what he described as Iraq\u2019s need to avoid dependence on neighboring Iran for power supplies including electricity.\nThe diversion to Iraq by Mr. Pompeo, who was in the midst of a four-day European tour, added to what is an escalating American effort to ostracize Iran, which the Trump administration has sought to vilify as the chief destabilizing force in the Middle East.\nThere was no immediate comment from the leaders of Iran, who contend that the United States is the region\u2019s core source of turmoil. But the increased tensions between the long-estranged countries has created fears of an armed confrontation.\nThe Iraq stopover followed new warnings by Mr. Pompeo and the White House national security adviser, John R. Bolton, that Iran and what they called its proxy forces appeared to be preparing for attacks against United States troops and other interests in the region.\nMr. Pompeo met with top Iraqi officials, including Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi, Foreign Minister Mohamed Ali Alhakim and President Barham Salih.\n\u201cFirst of all, we talked to them about the importance of Iraq ensuring that it\u2019s able to adequately protect Americans in their country,\u201d Mr. Pompeo told reporters traveling with him after they had departed Baghdad. The Iraqis had \u201cprovided assurances that they understood that was their responsibility,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want anyone interfering in their country, certainly not by attacking another nation inside of Iraq, and there was complete agreement,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said.\nIraqi officials were far more circumspect in their description of the meetings. \u201cBoth sides discussed the bilateral relations and the recent updates in the security of the region and efforts of fighting terrorism,\u201d a Foreign Ministry spokesman said.\nMr. Pompeo\u2019s visit, shrouded in secrecy until after it was over, came on the eve of the one-year anniversary of Mr. Trump\u2019s repudiation of the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran and the reimposition of American sanctions, which have been increasingly squeezing Iran\u2019s economy. Iran said Monday it would no longer comply with parts of the agreement, alarming European officials who have hoped to preserve the accord, meant to ensure Iran\u2019s peaceful use of nuclear energy.\nThe choreography of Mr. Pompeo\u2019s Iraq stopover also appeared designed to send a message to Iran. Before he flew to Baghdad, the State Department said Mr. Pompeo, who had been in Finland, had abandoned a scheduled meeting in Berlin with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany because of unidentified \u201cpressing issues.\u201d\nThe Trump administration has not provided specific details about what it has called the new threat from Iran, which has drawn some skepticism, given the history of faulty intelligence that led to the Iraq war. But officials have told The New York Times that new intelligence has raised concerns about Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and its connections to some of Iraq\u2019s Shiite Arab militias.\nAsked by reporters to elaborate, Mr. Pompeo said, \u201cI just don\u2019t want to go into the details of that anymore.\u201d But he also reiterated his contention that the Revolutionary Guards is a terrorist organization. \u201cThis was just calling out the truth,\u201d he said.\nIt was Mr. Pompeo who last month placed the Revolutionary Guards on the State Department\u2019s list of foreign terrorist organizations, against the advice of American intelligence and Pentagon officials, who warned that Iran\u2019s clerical government could reciprocate and put United States personnel at risk in the Middle East.\nLast week, President Hassan Rouhani of Iran declared all American forces in the Middle East terrorists and labeled the United States government a state sponsor of terrorism.\nTo counter what the Trump administration has described as the new threat, the Pentagon has expedited an already-scheduled deployment of the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike group to the Persian Gulf.\nMr. Pompeo said he also raised the issue of Iraq\u2019s energy requirements with his Iraqi hosts, who have been upset at American demands that it stop relying on imported Iranian power supplies. The Trump administration gave Iraq a waiver in March to purchase Iranian electricity without incurring American penalties, but that waiver is set to expire in June.\n\u201cWe want them to have the opportunity to have multiple sources and a diverse energy base,\u201d Mr. Pompeo told reporters before his meetings. \u201cWe think that\u2019s better for an independent, sovereign Iraq.\u201d\nMr. Pompeo\u2019s trip coincided with news that Iraq is close to signing a $53 billion, 30-year agreement with Exxon Mobil and PetroChina to develop oil fields in southern Iraq.\nSuch deals, Mr. Pompeo said, \u201care important to Iraq \u2014 big energy deals that can disconnect them from Iranian energy.\u201d\nHe was traveling from Finland, where he had attended an annual meeting of diplomats from Arctic nations. A State Department spokeswoman, Morgan Ortagus, said the \u201cimportant set of meetings\u201d that had been canceled in Berlin would be rescheduled.\nMr. Pompeo had been set to meet with Ms. Merkel and Heiko Maas, Germany\u2019s foreign minister, to discuss Ukraine, Russia, China, Syria, the Western Balkans and other issues, according to a schedule released by the State Department last week.\nGermany has long considered the United States its most trusted ally, but relations have been badly strained under the administration of Mr. Trump, who has publicly chided Ms. Merkel and her government over issues including refugees and a planned gas pipeline with Russia. He has threatened to impose tariffs on automobile imports from Germany.\nThe chancellor\u2019s office and Germany\u2019s Foreign Ministry declined to comment officially on the decision, but both made clear that the cancellation had come from Mr. Pompeo\u2019s side.\nMr. Pompeo told reporters he had spoken with Mr. Maas on the plane ride to Baghdad to express regret about the cancellation.\n\u201cHe understood completely,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said. \u201cHe also knows that our relationship with Iraq is important, and we\u2019re partners in the challenges that Iran presents to Germany and to Europe as well.\u201d\nGerman commentators said the decision reflected what they called the deterioration of German-American relations.\n\u201cMore than two years since Donald Trump came to power, much of that which for a long time was lauded as the German-American friendship now lies in pieces,\u201d read an opinion piece in the left-leaning daily S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung.\nAt the Arctic Council meeting in Finland, Mr. Pompeo delivered a sharp warning to Russia and China about potential intervention in the region. He was still expected to meet in London on Wednesday with Prime Minister Theresa May and to deliver a speech on the United States\u2019 relationship with Britain. Mr. Pompeo was then to travel to Greenland on Thursday.", "date": "May 7, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/07/world/europe/pompeo-cancels-berlin.html", "tags": "iran trip concerns germany makes u.s. \u201d pompeo state press iraq unscheduled"}
