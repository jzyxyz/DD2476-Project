{"title": "AG Barr- Mueller Report Doesn't Find Trump Conspired With Russia, Doesn't 'Exonerate' Him On Obstruction", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2015 Special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report did not find that Donald Trump\u2019s campaign conspired with Russia to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election, but did not exonerate the president on the question of whether he committed obstruction of justice.\u00a0\n\u201cAfter reviewing the Special Counsel\u2019s final report on these issues; consulting with Department officials, including the Office of Legal Counsel; and applying the principles of federal prosecution that guide our charging decisions, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and I have concluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense,\u201d Barr wrote.\nBarr,\u00a0confirmed\u00a0by the Senate as the nation\u2019s top law enforcement official last month, wrote in the letter that he would work to make as much of Mueller\u2019s full report available to Congress and the public as possible after the redaction of grand jury information.\nAlthough Mueller\u2019s report \u201cdoes not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him,\u201d the special counsel wrote in his confidential report, according to Barr\u2019s summary.\nMueller did not find that the Trump campaign or its associates conspired with Moscow to tilt the 2016 election in Trump\u2019s favor, \u201cdespite multiple offers from Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign,\u201d Barr wrote in his letter.\nIn addition to investigating Russian election interference, Mueller also looked into whether Trump \u2014 who fired former FBI Director James Comey after he refused to pledge loyalty to the president and later reportedly\u00a0tried to fire Mueller \u2014 obstructed justice by working to interfere with the special counsel\u2019s probe. The special counsel ultimately declined to \u201cmake a traditional prosecutorial judgment\u201d as to whether the president committed obstruction of justice.\nAccording to the attorney general, the absence of a finding that Trump was involved in Russian election interference impacted his and Rosenstein\u2019s conclusion that there wasn\u2019t sufficient evidence to accuse the president of obstructing justice. In other words, how could Trump have intentionally obstructed an investigation into something he wasn\u2019t guilty of?\u00a0\nBarr claimed in his letter that Mueller\u2019s decision against reaching any legal conclusions \u201cleaves it to the Attorney General to determine whether the conduct described in the report constitutes a crime.\u201d But it\u2019s not clear why Barr felt the need to weigh in, according to former DOJ official Matthew Miller. \u201cHe could\u2019ve just passed on Mueller\u2019s findings, but decided to put his thumb on the scale after a 48 hour review of the facts,\u201d Miller tweeted on Sunday.\u00a0\nA long-standing Justice Department opinion holds that federal prosecutors cannot indict a sitting president \u2014 but Barr claimed in his letter that his determination was \u201cmade without regard to, and is not based on, the constitutional considerations that surround the indictment and criminal prosecution of a sitting president.\u201d\nBut Barr is not exactly an impartial observer on the matter of obstruction of justice.\u00a0In June 2018, months before Trump nominated him for the attorney general position, Barr sent an unsolicited memo to Rosenstein arguing that the special counsel had no basis for the obstruction of justice investigation. Trump, Barr claimed, was acting within his presidential authority when he pressured Comey to drop part of the FBI\u2019s Russia investigation and when he later fired the FBI director.\u00a0\nThe decision by a DOJ official nominated by Trump to excuse the president of obstruction of justice allegations is likely to infuriate congressional Democrats, who are already demanding access to Mueller\u2019s full report and the underlying evidence. But Barr has indicated that he believes that Justice Department regulations prevent him from releasing derogatory information about individuals the department has not charged with any crime.\nMueller turned his report over to the Justice Department on Friday afternoon, less than two years after Rosenstein named him to the position after Comey\u2019s firing. The special counsel\u2019s team issued more than 2,800 subpoenas, executed almost 500 search warrants, obtained more than 230 orders for communications records, made 13 requests for evidence to foreign governments, and interviewed about 500 witnesses, Barr wrote in his summary of the investigation.\nStill, the special counsel closed the investigation without ever securing an interview with Trump under oath. After months of negotiations, Mueller settled on Trump\u2019s legal team submitting written responses to the special counsel\u2019s questions.\u00a0\nDuring the course of his probe, Mueller brought about the indictments of six Trump associates, as well as networks of Russian hackers who boosted Trump\u2019s candidacy on social media and hacked into Democratic emails to damage Democrat Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.\nThere will be no additional indictments from Mueller\u2019s office, although other prosecutors could use evidence uncovered by the special counsel\u2019s team in their own lawsuits.\nRead Barr\u2019s letter below:\nThis story has been updated with additional detail on Mueller\u2019s investigation.", "date": "\n03/24/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/william-barr-mueller-report-findings_n_5c9645a4e4b01ebeef0ff759", "tags": "ag find report barr- \u201c investigation counsel conspired justice trump barr russia obstruction special mueller"}
