{"title": "Clinton Reaffirms Support For Public Option In Bid For Sanders Supporters", "content": "Hillary Clinton\u00a0reaffirmed her support on Saturday for creating a \u201cpublic option\u201d within Obamacare and allowing people to enroll in Medicare at age 55.\nThe presumptive Democratic presidential nominee also called for a substantial increase in funding in medical clinics that serve low-income Americans, fully embracing a proposal from Sen.\u00a0Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).\nWhile Clinton has long supported the creation of new government-run insurance options and reiterated that support several times this year, Saturday\u2019s statement comes three days before she is scheduled to make her first joint campaign appearance with Sanders \u2015 who has championed government-run insurance and federally financed clinics throughout his career and during his own bid for the presidency.\nSanders, who ran a surprisingly strong but ultimately unsuccessful campaign for the Democratic nomination, is expected to endorse Clinton at that Tuesday event. Saturday\u2019s announcement on health policy follows a similar one from Clinton earlier in the week, that she was enhancing her own proposal on college tuition assistance to match the considerably more generous version Sanders had sketched out.\nIn describing the proposals to The Huffington Post, senior Clinton campaign aides noted that Sanders had championed these ideas \u2015 and, in particular, that the former Secretary of State\u2019s funding proposal for the clinics matched one that the independent senator had made.\u00a0\n\u201cWe have more work to do to finish our long fight to provide universal, quality, affordable health care to everyone in America,\u201d Clinton said in a press release that the campaign circulated late Saturday morning. \u201cAlready, the Affordable Care Act has expanded coverage to 20 million Americans. As president, I will make sure Republicans never succeed in their attempts to strip away their care and that the remaining uninsured should be able to get the affordable coverage they need to stay healthy.\u201d\nSanders said in a conference call shortly afterwards that the announcement was the product of discussion between the two campaigns. He praised Clinton\u2019s proposal in strong, unambiguous terms \u2015 describing it as \u201can extremely important initiative\u201d and predicting that \u201cit will save lives, it will ease suffering, it will improve health care in America, and it will cut health care costs.\u201d\nThe idea of the public option \u2015 as first sketched out by Jacob Hacker, a Yale political scientist \u2015 is to create a separate, government-run insurance plan that would compete with private insurers offering coverage through the Affordable Care Act\u2019s exchanges. The hope is that this competition can help keep premiums for all the insurance plans low, particularly if the government-run plan has the ability to dictate low reimbursement rates to doctors, hospitals, drugmakers, and other suppliers of medical care. \nPresident Barack Obama and Democratic leaders\u00a0included versions of the public option in their proposals when they\u00a0first began working on health care reform in 2009. But they ended up jettisoning the idea in response to protests from more conservative Democrats, who were less enthusiastic about government programs and industry groups, like hospitals and insurance companies, that feared what a public option would do to their income streams.\nThe idea of a Medicare buy-in has been around for even longer, although it, too, appeared in 2009 when Democrats were drawing up health care legislation. The goal, again, would be to give consumers \u2015 in this case, those older than 55 and at greater risk of becoming sick \u2015 one more insurance option if they can\u2019t get coverage through an employer or an existing government program.\nClinton has expressed support for both ideas during the 2016 campaign, noting that she had called for them previously. (She made a public option part of her campaign proposal to reform health care in 2008.) But campaign aides said Saturday\u2019s announcement is a reminder of how seriously she takes the idea \u2015 and her determination to promote it as president.\nThat might reassure some of the progressive Sanders supporters skeptical of Clinton\u2019s commitment to their values and goals \u2015 and, in some cases, angry at her attacks on Sanders\u2019 proposal to create a single, government-run insurance plan that would provide coverage to all Americans, supplanting private insurance altogether.\nOf course, Clinton\u2019s announcement comes with no policy details. She isn\u2019t answering any of the many complicated questions that either proposal would raise \u2015 like exactly how either the Obamacare public option or Medicare buy-in plan would pay the providers of medical services, or exactly who could enroll in either one.\nClinton\u2019s call to increase funding for federally run health clinics is a bit more specific, in that she\u2019s put a dollar figure on it. It would be $40 billion over 10 years. She hasn\u2019t identified new revenue or spending cuts to cover the cost of the proposal, but she has said that she will remain true to her pledge to pay for the price of any proposals \u2015 a pledge that she has largely kept in this campaign, independent budget analysts say.\nAnd while the clinic proposal likely to get a lot less attention than anything Clinton says about the public option of Medicare, the idea, if implemented, could help a great many people get medical care.\nThe clinics are the backbone of the nation\u2019s health care safety net, providing primary care to millions of Americans who either have no health insurance or whose insurance doesn\u2019t meet their needs \u2015 a group that, even after the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, is large and underserved.\nAbout one in 14 Americans currently gets health care through a federally funded clinic, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. That\u2019s thanks to annual funding of about $5 billion, a big chunk of which comes from a provision in the Affordable Care Act that Sanders championed.\n\u201cThis would be a substantial infusion of funding,\u201d Larry Levitt, senior vice president of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, told HuffPost. \u201cMore funding for community health centers creates an infrastructure to care for increasing numbers of insured people and also provides resources to reach the remaining uninsured to encourage them to get covered.\u201d\nFederal clinics happen to be one of the few government-run healthcare programs with a history of strong bipartisan support. George W. Bush was a big fan during his presidency, for example. So while both a public option and Medicare buy-in would likely run into the same political opposition that stopped them in 2009,more money for clinics would have a chance of becoming law even with Republicans controlling a house of Congress.\nThis article has been updated to include more specific details on Clinton\u2019s proposal and reactions to it.\nCLARIFICATION:\u00a0Language has been updated to indicate that Clinton expressed support for the public option on her campaign site before the Saturday announcement.", "date": "\n07/09/2016", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/clinton-public-option_n_5781064fe4b01edea78e1cf1?696k1qtyxziu23xr", "tags": "support public supporters clinton bid proposal option \u2015 insurance sanders reaffirms care health"}
