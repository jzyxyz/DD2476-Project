{"title": "With a Search Warrant and a Threatened Indictment, Mueller\u2019s Inquiry Sets a Tone", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Paul J. Manafort was in bed early one morning in July when federal agents bearing a search warrant raided his Virginia home. They took binders stuffed with documents and copied his computer files, looking for evidence that Mr. Manafort, President Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, set up secret offshore bank accounts. They even photographed the expensive suits in his closet.\nThe special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, then followed the house search with a warning: His prosecutors told Mr. Manafort they planned to indict him, said two people close to the investigation.\nThe moves against Mr. Manafort are just a glimpse of the aggressive tactics used by Mr. Mueller and his team of prosecutors in the four months since taking over the Justice Department\u2019s investigation into Russia\u2019s attempts to disrupt last year\u2019s election, according to lawyers, witnesses and American officials who have described the approach. Dispensing with the plodding pace typical of many white-collar investigations, Mr. Mueller\u2019s team has used what some describe as shock-and-awe tactics to intimidate witnesses and potential targets of the inquiry.\nMr. Mueller has obtained a flurry of subpoenas to compel witnesses to testify before a grand jury, lawyers and witnesses say, sometimes before his prosecutors have taken the customary first step of interviewing them. One witness was called before the grand jury less than a month after his name surfaced in news accounts. The special counsel even took the unusual step of obtaining a subpoena for one of Mr. Manafort\u2019s former lawyers, claiming an exception to the rule that shields attorney-client discussions from scrutiny.\n\u201cThey are setting a tone. It\u2019s important early on to strike terror in the hearts of people in Washington, or else you will be rolled,\u201d said Solomon L. Wisenberg, who was deputy independent counsel in the investigation that led to the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton in 1999. \u201cYou want people saying to themselves, \u2018Man, I had better tell these guys the truth.\u2019\u201d\nA spokesman for Mr. Mueller declined to comment. Lawyers and a spokesman for Mr. Manafort also declined to comment.\nFew people can upend Washington like a federal prosecutor rooting around a presidential administration, and Mr. Mueller, a former F.B.I. director, is known to dislike meandering investigations that languish for years. At the same time, he appears to be taking a broad view of his mandate: examining not just the Russian disruption campaign and whether any of Mr. Trump\u2019s associates assisted in the effort, but also any financial entanglements with Russians going back several years. He is also investigating whether Mr. Trump tried to obstruct justice when he fired James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director.\nMr. Manafort is under investigation for possible violations of tax laws, money-laundering prohibitions and requirements to disclose foreign lobbying. Michael T. Flynn, the former national security adviser, is being scrutinized for foreign lobbying work as well as for conversations he had last year with Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United States. On Monday, Mr. Flynn\u2019s siblings announced the creation of a legal-defense fund to help cover their brother\u2019s \u201cenormous\u201d legal fees.\nThe wide-ranging nature of Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation could put him on a collision course with Mr. Trump, who has said publicly that Mr. Mueller should keep his investigation narrowly focused on last year\u2019s presidential campaign. In an interview with The New York Times, Mr. Trump said Mr. Mueller would be overstepping his boundaries if he investigated his family\u2019s finances unrelated to Russia.\nFor the moment, Mr. Mueller\u2019s team has shown a measure of deference to White House officials, sparing them grand jury subpoenas and allowing them to appear for voluntary interviews. Those sessions are expected to begin soon. Ty Cobb, a lawyer brought in to manage the White House response to the inquiry, has told administration officials that he wants to avoid any subpoenas from the special prosecutor.\nStaff members have been working long hours answering Mr. Mueller\u2019s request for 13 categories of documents, including records related to Mr. Comey\u2019s firing and Mr. Trump\u2019s role in drafting a misleading statement about a June 2016 meeting between campaign officials and Russian-born visitors. Nonetheless, the demand for documents has provoked at least one angry confrontation between Mr. Cobb and Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, over whether certain documents should be withheld to protect the president\u2019s right to confidentiality.\nBut associates of both Mr. Manafort and Mr. Flynn have received more peremptory treatment. Instead of invitations to the prosecutor\u2019s office, they have been presented with grand jury subpoenas, forcing them to either testify or take the Fifth Amendment and raise suspicions that they had something to hide. At least three witnesses have recently been subpoenaed to testify about Mr. Manafort: Jason Maloni, a spokesman who appeared before the grand jury for more than two hours on Friday, and the heads of two consulting firms \u2014 Mercury Public Affairs and the Podesta Group \u2014 who worked with Mr. Manafort on behalf of Viktor F. Yanukovych, the pro-Russia former president of Ukraine.\nMr. Mueller\u2019s team also took the unusual step of issuing a subpoena to Melissa Laurenza, a specialist in lobbying law who formerly represented Mr. Manafort, according to people familiar with the subpoena. Conversations between lawyers and their clients are normally considered bound by attorney-client privilege, but there are exceptions when lawyers prepare public documents that are filed on behalf of their client.\nMr. Mueller took over the Russia investigation in May, after the F.B.I. had already spent nearly a year looking into connections between Mr. Trump\u2019s associates and Russians. His team has occasionally been caught by surprise, hearing of possibly important information only when it is revealed in the news media.\nThis was the case in July, when Mr. Mueller\u2019s prosecutors learned about email exchanges between Donald Trump Jr. and an emissary for a Kremlin-connected Russian oligarch only after they were disclosed in The New York Times, according to a law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s son, set up the Trump Tower meeting to receive what he was told would be damaging information about Hillary Clinton from the Russian government.\nSoon after his name surfaced, one of the Russian-born participants at the meeting, Rinat Akhmetshin, was ordered to testify before the grand jury, according to one of Mr. Akhmetshin\u2019s associates.\n\u201cThey seem to be pursuing this more aggressively, taking a much harder line, than you\u2019d expect to see in a typical white-collar case,\u201d said Jimmy Gurul\u00e9, a Notre Dame law professor and former federal prosecutor. \u201cThis is more consistent with how you\u2019d go after an organized crime syndicate.\u201d\nThe tactics reflect some of the hard-charging \u2014 and polarizing \u2014 personalities of Mr. Mueller\u2019s team, seasoned prosecutors with experience investigating financial fraud, money laundering and organized crime.\nAdmirers of Andrew Weissmann, one of the team\u2019s senior prosecutors, describe him as relentless and uncompromising, while his detractors say his scorched earth tactics have backfired in some previous cases. Greg B. Andres, another one of Mr. Mueller\u2019s prosecutors, once ran an investigation into a Mafia kingpin. Zainab N. Ahmad made her name as a prosecutor pursing high-profile terrorism cases.\nSome lawyers defending people who have been caught up in Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation privately complain that the special counsel\u2019s team is unwilling to engage in the usual back-and-forth that precedes \u2014 or substitutes for \u2014 grand jury testimony. They argue that the team\u2019s more aggressive tactics might end up being counterproductive, especially if some grand jury witnesses turn out to be more guarded than they would have been in a more informal setting or invoke the Fifth Amendment.\nThe longer Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation goes on, the more vulnerable he will be to allegations that he is on a fishing expedition, said Katy Harriger, a professor of politics at Wake Forest University and the author of a book on special prosecutors. Such accusations dogged the investigation of Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel whose investigation of Mr. Clinton stretched on for years.\nTo a degree, Mr. Mueller is in a race against three congressional committees that are interviewing some of the same people who are of interest to the special prosecutor\u2019s team. Even if the committees refuse to grant them immunity, congressional testimony that becomes public can give other witnesses a chance to line up their stories.\nRep. Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said committee staff members were going to great lengths not to get in Mr. Mueller\u2019s way. But Senator Charles E. Grassley, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, indicated last week that his committee might subpoena witnesses to testify about the circumstances of Mr. Comey\u2019s firing even over Mr. Mueller\u2019s objections.\nMr. Mueller\u2019s need to navigate this complex landscape could explain the timing of the raid on Mr. Manafort\u2019s house, which took place in the early hours of July 26. The raid came one day after Mr. Manafort was interviewed by staff members of the Senate Intelligence Committee.\nOn the day of the raid, Mr. Manafort was scheduled to talk to the Senate Judiciary Committee, an interview that was eventually canceled.\nIt is unusual for a prosecutor to seek a search warrant against someone who, like Mr. Manafort, had already put his lawyer in contact with the Justice Department. No search warrants were executed during the investigations by Mr. Starr or Patrick J. Fitzgerald, a special counsel appointed during the George W. Bush administration to investigate the leak of the name of a C.I.A. officer.\nTo get the warrant, Mr. Mueller\u2019s team had to show probable cause that Mr. Manafort\u2019s home contained evidence of a crime. To be allowed to enter the home unannounced, prosecutors had to persuade a federal judge that Mr. Manafort was likely to destroy evidence.\nSaid Mr. Gurul\u00e9, the former federal prosecutor, \u201cClearly they didn\u2019t trust him.\u201d", "date": "Sept. 18, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/18/us/politics/mueller-russia-investigation.html", "tags": "prosecutors warrant inquiry manafort investigation indictment team one threatened tone sets witnesses mueller search"}
