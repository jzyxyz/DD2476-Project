{"title": "T\u2019s Wellness Guide to London", "content": "In bygone days, most Brits\u2019 concept of self-care extended to punctuating their pints at the pub with the occasional glass of water, or bag of chips. Drawing on global influences that span from Australia to America\u2019s West Coast, a new wave of spas and workout studios in London is sparking a sea change in behaviors. (In the village-y enclaves of Chelsea and Hampstead, for example, heading out to lunch in your active wear is now normal.) The city\u2019s burgeoning health-conscious cafe scene, meanwhile, is slowly shifting perceptions of English food culture from \u201cbeige\u201d to \u201cgreen.\u201d That\u2019s not to say that the word \u201cwellness\u201d won\u2019t still elicit eye rolls in certain quarters \u2014 London will, thankfully, never be L.A. \u2014 but progressive city dwellers have, over the last five years, been embracing that culture in a totally unprecedented way. So, whether you\u2019re in need of salve for the body or the soul, or simply looking to stock up your larder, here\u2019s our guide to the best health offerings to be had in the British capital.\nIn 2012, Jemima Jones \u2014 sister of the artist Quentin Jones \u2014 and the photographer Lucy Carr-Ellison founded a health-focused, on-set catering business called Tart London. Late last year, they opened Wild by Tart, a cozy delicatessen, juice bar and apothecary inside a former power station and coal house in Belgravia. Come spring, they\u2019ll add a palatial sit-down restaurant, photography studio and events space to this smorgasbord of wellness. But for now, stop by Wild by Tart for grab-and-go salads, juices from the nutritional wunderkinds Health Is Wealth or Tart-designed ceramic kitchenware. 3-4 Eccleston Yards, London SW1W 9AZ, tart-london.com.\nNotting Hill\u2019s Farm Girl Cafe brings Melbourne\u2019s brunch scene to London, with pretty, clean fare that\u2019s turned it into the city\u2019s go-to spot. Opened in 2015 by the Australian former fashion publicist Rose Mann and her Swiss-raised partner Anthony Hood, Farm Girl\u2019s holistic menu of coconut BLTs, bowls and flower-strewn lavender lattes are such a hit that they\u2019ve since expanded to Soho and Chelsea. The Beata Heuman-designed interiors \u2014 featuring rustic wood floors, marbleized wallpaper and a few millennial-pink tables \u2014 have only served to amplify its Instagram appeal. 59a Portobello Road, London W11 3DB, thefarmgirl.co.uk.\nRead more: T\u2019s Wellness Guide to New York\nThough the menu at Farmacy, a chic restaurant sandwiched between Notting Hill and Bayswater, is entirely plant-based, it allows for self-indulgence. Opened in 2016 by Camilla Al-Fayed, daughter of the former Harrods owner Mohamed Al-Fayed, it caters to the kind of vegans who\u2019ll occasionally choose to chase their supercharged salads and kimchi bowls with a matcha caipiroska rather than a chai latte. Farmacy\u2019s medicinal-nutritional ethos extends from its apothecary-style green-striped awning to the health-boosting shots that arrive at your table in syringes. 74 Westbourne Grove, London W2 5SH, farmacylondon.com.\nWhen Steven Novick, the Milwaukee-born, London-based founder of Farmstand, was given the all-clear after a cancer diagnosis, he set himself a goal: to build a business around the plant-based food that he believes helped cure him. But rather than starting another highfalutin temple to avocado toast, Novick created a thriving all-day cafe and corporate food business that offers the usual health-conscious mainstays at amazingly accessible prices. With speedy (and economical) breakfast, lunch and dinner options, this is wellness for all. 42 Drury Lane, London WC2B 5AJ, farmstand.co.uk.\nThis small, street-side counter attached to the Ace Hotel in Hoxton is more than just a juice joint. Opened in 2015, the East London Juice Co. is a micro-batch dispensary offering botanical and medicinal elixirs, broths (their vegan broth alone lists more than 100 health-giving ingredients) and powders, all cooked up on site. You can find everything from a raw smoothie to a micro-brewed shroom coffee on the menu. The store also crafts its own (globally shippable) small-batch bathing salts, ghees and bee butters. 100 Shoreditch High Street, London E1 6JQ, eastlondonjuice.com.\nYotam Ottolenghi is something of an accidental wellness guru. The Israeli-British chef, who is the author of six celebrated cookbooks (most recently \u201cSimple\u201d), has been championing vegetables at his quartet of London delis (as well as his restaurants, Nopi and Rovi) for close to two decades. Though by no means vegetarian, or consciously clean-and-green, these whitewashed lunchtime eateries serve up endlessly imaginative combinations of salads, grains and proteins laced with Middle Eastern flavor. Staples include courgette, squash and za\u2019atar fritters and hawaij cauliflower with preserved lemon yogurt. Pile up your lunchtime takeaway box, and there\u2019ll be fuel enough for dinner. Multiple locations, ottolenghi.co.uk.\nLady Carole Bamford calls her pristine fleet of Haybarn spas \u2014 in Miami, Tokyo, the English Cotswolds and now, London\u2019s South Kensington \u2014 \u201crestorative spaces to disconnect.\u201d Certainly, the warm white and oak interiors and light-filled yoga studio create a cocooning ambience of self-care. Treatments employ Bamford\u2019s namesake organic beauty line, including the new aromatherapy-based B Silent products, all of which you can pick up in-store. The real charm, though, is the hands-on healing from Estelle Bingham, whose holistic crystal therapy has the beauty crowd beguiled. 104 Draycott Avenue, London SW3 3AE, bamford.com. \nThe first international outlet from the L.A. beauty business, this subterranean spa in the heart of Soho is a big hit with British fashion editors. (It\u2019s located in the basement of the fashion and design emporium Alex Eagle Studio.) The signature facial promises \u201cclear, radiant, lifted\u201d skin, thanks to no-nonsense extraction, double cleansing and galvanic infusions. Its soon-to-launch product line will include cleansing milks, antioxidant serums and resurfacing face and body wipes. It\u2019s the perfect doubled-pronged wellness offering to boost your complexion \u2014 and your wardrobe \u2014 all in one. 6-10 Lexington Street, London W1F 0LB, alexeagle.co.uk.\nSince Triyoga was forced out by developers some five years ago, the leafy neighborhood of Primrose Hill has lacked a wellness hub. That changed with the arrival of the body-sculpting workout studio Body by Simone this month. Already a Hollywood wonder, the Australian dancer-turned-trainer Simone De La Rue has worked with Chrissy Teigen, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Sandra Bullock (who she famously prepped for her role in \u201cGravity\u201d). Blending intense dance cardio and strength training, the BBS technique molds a long, lean powerfully defined physique. 86-88 Delancey Street, Camden Town, London NW1 7SA, bodybysimone.com.\nYoga takes an art-informed, immersive turn at this hip Shoreditch studio. Inspired by the illuminating work of artists such as James Turrell, ChromaYoga creator Nina Ryner peps up the ancient practice with light and color therapy. Classes in what she calls \u201clight therapy yoga\u201d are curated according to your mood. Guests can choose between an energizing \u201cRed,\u201d dynamic \u201cBlue,\u201d or soothing \u201cPink\u201d class \u2014 or they can go all-out at the dynamic \u201cChromatic\u201d class, aimed at easing the impact of seasonal change on the body\u2019s natural circadian rhythms. 45 Charlotte Road, London EC2A 3DP, chromayoga.co.uk.\nYou could argue that it was the Australian sisters Jasmine and Melissa Hemsley \u2014 better known as Hemsley & Hemsley \u2014 who helped kick-start the detox trend in London with the 2014 launch of their best-selling cookbook, \u201cThe Art of Eating Well.\u201d Now, the glow-y skinned siblings both have their own successful pursuits. While Melissa zeroes in on her work as a chef and food writer, one of Jasmine\u2019s many forays into the world of wellness is the sound bath \u2014 something of a novelty in the British capital. Whether alone, or together with her friend Toni Dicks under the moniker Sound Sebastien, Hemsley leads sonic experiences that are, she says, both \u201cdreamy and nurturing.\u201d Guests are given blankets, lavender-infused eye masks and invited to lie down and immerse themselves in the percussive orchestra of crystal bowls, chimes and hand drums. \u201cYou only need to arrive and surrender,\u201d Hemsley says.  jasminehemsley.com.\nPagan perspectives meet psychological research at this soothing sanctuary in Holland Park. Set up by the psychotherapist and biodynamic psychologist Fiona Arrigo \u2014 a former model and socialite in the 1970s \u2014 this spa represents something of a seismic shift in a country that\u2019s stereotypically therapy-averse. Devotees of the mind-cleansing \u201cArrigo Programme\u201d no longer need to journey to her Somerset cottage for a four-day retreat; anyone can now book in for a swift London session hosted in a plush Victorian drawing room. Arrigo wanted to create somewhere to \u201creflect, learn, commune and find inner calm.\u201d With New Moon Goddess gatherings and Vedic mysticism also on the menu, it\u2019s about as close as you can get to nirvana this side of the West Way. 118B Holland Park Avenue, London W11 4UA, aplacetoheal.co.uk.\nSo beloved is the calmative ethos of the London facialist Amanda Lacey that more than a quarter-of-a-century since she started her practice, the waiting list at her understated Chelsea atelier remains stubbornly long. Lacey\u2019s restorative skin philosophy relies on essential oils to target issues and anti-aging (facials are performed by her alone). Her small line of perfume and skin-care products are made in her lab, which includes the much raved-about new rose-infused Soft Pink Cream, and comes in wonderfully old-school, apothecary-style glass bottles. amandalacey.com/facial-atelier.\nWhen the green-fingered Lady Carole Bamford persuaded her husband to banish pesticides from their 1,700-acre farm in Gloucestershire more than three decades ago, little did she know it would spawn an award-winning organic enterprise encompassing food, homeware, beauty and clothing. At Daylesford\u2019s fourth London organic farm store and cafe on Sloane Avenue, the Cotswolds truly comes to Chelsea: An old, English oak tree, salvaged by Bamford from her Kingham estate, and artfully hollowed out by the woodsman Rhys Davis, splices magnificently through all three floors of the store, which sells soups and broths, meat and fish as well as larder goods all fresh from their organic farm. 76-82 Sloane Avenue, London SW3 3DZ, daylesford.com.\nThis organic and whole-food-focused supermarket has been a Shoreditch stalwart since 2006. Within an interior that\u2019s more rustic than sleek, you\u2019ll find a well-curated selection of household and beauty goods, a therapy room for crystal healing and massage, and an all-day cafe offering gluten-free waffles, stews and superfood salads \u2014 though it\u2019s worth a visit for the organic wines alone. 52-56 Kingsland Road, London E2 8DP, thegroceryshop.co.uk.\nWhat began as a line of adaptogenic herbal remedies created by brand planner-turned-chef Sasha Sabapathy, has evolved into London\u2019s hottest wellness cafe and infrared spa. With its ambient lighting and amethyst-pink walls, Glow Bar provides a serene escape from the craziness of nearby Oxford Street. Pull up at the bar for an a\u00e7a\u00ed bowl and a \u201cSiren\u201d moon milk (an Ayuverdic drink charged with spirulina, pearl and marine collagen) or shop for \u201chigh vibe\u201d crystal scalp massage combs and organic beauty products by Hanx and Kyprus. But the big draw is in the basement, where a 45-minute session in one of Glow Bar\u2019s Infrared Saunas will provide just the midwinter endorphin hit you need. 70 Mortimer Street, London W1W7RY, glowbarldn.com.\nThis organic skin-care store, salon and naturopathic clinic \u2014 which has been operating out of Marylebone since 2008 \u2014 recently found a much larger new home and has expanded its offering to include organic clothing and lifestyle goods. The shop\u2019s founder, Imelda Burke, has an exacting eye for all things natural beauty: Content was one of the first British outlets to sell skin-care and makeup brands such as RMS Beauty, Soapwalla and May Lindstrom. No wonder customers return \u2014 be it for the Tata Harper facials, nontoxic manicures or on-the-spot makeup bag detox consultations. Top of our shopping lists: the chic cotton underwear by the Danish brand Organic Basics. 32-34 New Cavendish Street, Marylebone, London W1G 8UE, contentbeautywellbeing.com. \nRunning routes in London, recommended by the London-based trainer Cory Wharton-Malcolm, a Nike Run Coach and founder of the running club Track Mafia.\nThis 5K begins at Westminster Bridge, opposite Big Ben.
