{"title": "In China, Daydreaming Students Are Caught on Camera", "content": "BEIJING \u2014 In the halls of Yuzhou No. 1 High School in central China, students refer to them simply as \u201cthe cameras.\u201d\nWhen the first bell sounds before 7 a.m., their fish-eye lenses spring to life, broadcasting live as students sit at their desks and measure geometric angles, pass notes or doze during breaks. Before long, thousands of people \u2014 not just parents and teachers \u2014 are watching online, offering armchair commentary.\n\u201cWhat is this boy doing? He\u2019s been looking around doing nothing, like a cat on a hot roof,\u201d one user wrote. \u201cThis one is playing with his phone!\u201d added another, posting a screenshot.\nAs internet speeds have improved, live-streaming has become a cultural phenomenon in China, transforming online entertainment and everyday rituals like dating and dining. Now the nation\u2019s obsession with live video is invading its schools, and not everyone is happy about it.\nThousands of schools \u2014 public and private, from kindergarten to college \u2014 are installing webcams in classrooms and streaming live on websites that are open to the public, betting that round-the-clock supervision, even from strangers, will help motivate students.\nSchool officials see the cameras as a way to improve student confidence and crowdsource the task of catching misbehaving pupils. Parents use the feeds to monitor their children\u2019s academic progress and spy on their friendships and romances. But many students see live-streaming as an intrusion, prompting a broader debate in China about privacy, educational ethics and the perils of helicopter parenting.\n\u201cI hate it,\u201d said Ding Yue, a 17-year-old senior at Yuzhou No. 1 High, in Xuchang, a city in Henan Province. \u201cI feel like we are zoo animals.\u201d\nSome experts warn that live-streaming in schools will make Chinese youth, already accustomed to the nation\u2019s extensive internet censorship and use of outdoor security cameras, even more sensitive to surveillance.\n\u201cIf classrooms are under surveillance at all times, instruction will definitely be influenced by outside factors and the opinions of whoever is watching,\u201d said Xiong Bingqi, vice president of the 21st Century Education Research Institute, an influential Chinese think tank, who called the practice a violation of students\u2019 rights and a threat to academic freedom.\nAfter a critical article on the subject recently in The Beijing News, a prominent newspaper, several schools announced they were ending the broadcasts. But thousands of others chose to remain online and continue to draw a daily audience of cyber class monitors eager to report daydreaming students and lax teachers.\nThere are dozens of live-streaming platforms in China, and classroom feeds can be found on many of them. Anyone with an internet connection can visit and choose from thousands of live school feeds. The most popular site may be Shuidi, owned by the internet security giant Qihoo 360 Technology Company, which sells webcams and software, among other products.\n\u201cWhen you tell them, \u2018It\u2019s possible your parents might be behind your back watching,\u2019 it\u2019s like a sword hanging over their heads,\u201d said Zhao Weifeng, the director of a private school in the eastern province of Jiangsu that installed cameras in its classrooms last year. \u201cHaving surveillance makes children behave better.\u201d\nThe Deep Blue Children Robot Center, a network of technology enrichment programs based in Beijing, said it had made live-streaming a central part of its teaching model.\n\u201cA noble person shouldn\u2019t have anything to hide,\u201d said Jiang Jifa, a computer scientist and co-founder of the network. \u201cEveryone needs to be able to pose onstage, to run for office, to receive attention from the country and the world.\u201d\nIn China\u2019s cutthroat education system, live-streaming has also found evangelists among G.P.A.-obsessed parents looking for new ways to push their children and schools eager to improve academic performance. \u201cIt helps students spend their time more efficiently and get into their dream universities,\u201d a parent of a senior at Yuzhou No. 1 High wrote recently in an online forum.\nWebcams have proved especially popular at rural boarding schools, where teachers say live-streaming can be a vital link between children and parents, often migrants working in cities hundreds of miles away.\nChina is not the first to use internet-enabled cameras in classrooms. Private schools and charter schools in the United States have in recent years experimented with closed-circuit, private broadcasts to deter crime and misbehavior. Britain is testing body cameras for teachers in part to gather evidence for student disciplinary hearings.\nBut critics say Chinese schools have adopted live-streaming technology on an unheard-of scale and with few of the privacy protections in place elsewhere.\nDeng Xu, whose daughter attends an elite preschool in Beijing, said she understood the desire to keep an eye on children and their teachers at school, especially when they are very young. But she said at some point parents had to let go.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just sad to be watched all the time,\u201d she said. \u201cParents need to learn to be hands-off.\u201d\nHan Xiao, a lawyer in Beijing who has spoken out against live-streaming in classrooms, said that many schools were operating the cameras without the consent of parents and students and that public broadcasts posed a threat to student safety.\n\u201cClassrooms are enclosed spaces, so the activities of students like reading and eating snacks should be regarded as private,\u201d he said. \u201cLiving under surveillance and fear will hurt students\u2019 potential to grow.\u201d\nQihoo 360\u2019s cameras are advertised as tools for deterring thieves and monitoring young children at home. But the company said it had not targeted schools for sales. It added that it had not received complaints about privacy and that individuals initiating live-streams must agree to respect the privacy of others.\n\u201cMany schools and teachers willingly bought and installed our devices and choose to share the footage voluntarily,\u201d the company said in a statement.\nLive-streaming in general is on the cutting edge of entertainment in China, making stars of ordinary people as they use their phones to broadcast meals, candid monologues on the meaning of life and tutorials on subjects like applying makeup and rebuilding cars.\nThe industry more than doubled in size in 2016 and is expected to generate $5 billion in revenue this year, largely through the sale of virtual gifts, according to Credit Suisse. But it has proved difficult for the Chinese government to regulate.\nThe authorities issued guidelines last fall that banned pornography and original news reporting on live-streaming channels. The rules recognized a general right to privacy, but did not address the use of live-streaming in schools.\nAt Yuzhou No. 1 High, which began live-streaming classes late last year, students now joke that their school should instead be called \u201cYuzhou No. 1 Prison.\u201d\nReached by telephone, several said they were uncomfortable that anyone with an internet connection could tune into their classroom discussions. To avoid the camera\u2019s stare, they sometimes congregate in a blind spot near the front of the classroom, they said.\n\u201cWho knows if there are any psychopaths watching?\u201d asked Li Li, a junior.\nThe school did not respond to a request for comment.\nDing Yue, the senior, said live-streaming had also contributed to bullying at the school, recalling how a student was teased after classmates read that an online commenter had made fun of his looks.\n\u201cMost students want to speak and fend for themselves, but we don\u2019t have the power,\u201d he said, when asked if students had complained to the school. \u201cIt\u2019s the business of grown-ups. We aren\u2019t allowed to talk about it.\u201d", "date": "April 25, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/25/world/asia/in-china-daydreaming-students-are-caught-on-camera.html", "tags": "caught live-streaming china cameras parents \u201d schools school camera daydreaming students"}
