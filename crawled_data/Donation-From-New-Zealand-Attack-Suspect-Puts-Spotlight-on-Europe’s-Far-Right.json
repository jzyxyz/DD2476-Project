{"title": "Donation From New Zealand Attack Suspect Puts Spotlight on Europe\u2019s Far Right", "content": "BERLIN \u2014 Clean-shaven, well-dressed and polite, Martin Sellner is the poster boy of Europe\u2019s new far right. A 30-year-old philosophy graduate, he blogs about what he says is the threat Muslim immigration poses for Europe, stages nonviolent protests and is widely known on the global far-right scene.\nJust how widely became clear this week when it emerged that Mr. Sellner received a 1,500 euro donation \u2014 about $1,700 \u2014 a year ago from Brenton Harrison Tarrant of Australia, who is accused of killing 50 Muslim worshipers in Christchurch, New Zealand, two weeks ago.\n\u201cHe gave me a generous donation and I thanked him, that\u2019s all,\u201d Mr. Sellner said in a telephone interview Wednesday, condemning the attack but acknowledging that the two men had written back and forth a few times over email.\nThat contact with the Christchurch suspect has renewed concerns that despite a self-conscious effort by Europe\u2019s \u201cnew right\u201d to rebrand itself with more careful language and a youthful face, its ideology is not much different from that of the neo-Nazis of old.\nAnd now, some say, the ideas promoted by Mr. Sellner and his increasingly well-networked web of actors may serve as an incitement to terrorism with a potentially global reach.\n\u201cThe ethos of the identitarians is nonviolent,\u201d said Peter Neumann, director of the International Center for the Study of Radicalization at King\u2019s College in London. \u201cBut they promote an idea that is taken by some people to justify violence. It is not directly responsible for the violence \u2014 but it enables it.\u201d\nAustrian security services raided Mr. Sellner\u2019s apartment on Monday, confiscating his electronics and opening an investigation into links between the Christchurch attack and Mr. Sellner\u2019s movement, Generation Identity.\n[Read more about the growth of Generation Identity.]\nChancellor Sebastian Kurz of Austria, a conservative, said Wednesday that his government was considering banning Mr. Sellner\u2019s movement. \u201cThere is no tolerance for dangerous ideology,\u201d he said.\nBeyond the email exchange and the donation, there are other indicators that Mr. Sellner influenced the thinking of the Christchurch attack suspect.\nGeneration Identity\u2019s flagship idea \u2014 the \u201cGreat Replacement\u201d \u2014 was also the title of the manifesto Mr. Tarrant released through his social media account on the morning of the massacre. It is essentially a conspiracy theory that accuses liberal politicians of deliberately acting to supplant white Europeans with Muslims through mass migration and higher birthrates.\nMr. Sellner himself acknowledged in the telephone interview that Mr. Tarrant had expressed admiration for his work, and that he in turn had pointed Mr. Tarrant to his English-language YouTube videos. He also did not exclude the possibility that Mr. Tarrant\u2019s email had ended up in a list he used for groups emails.\nIn September 2018, around the time Mr. Tarrant was believed to be touring Europe, Mr. Sellner posted a YouTube video about the \u201cGreat Replacement.\u201d It has had over 100,000 views.\nMr. Sellner said he had never met Mr. Tarrant, who is reported to have visited Vienna during his travels, and rejected the idea that he could be held responsible for his actions.\nGeneration Identity originated in France in the orbit of the nativist essayist Renaud Camus. It has chapters in several European countries, counting a few thousand committed followers but far more sympathizers, officials say.\nMr. Neumann of King\u2019s College in London compared the movement to the Muslim Brotherhood, which has also mixed powerful conspiracy theories with a sense of existential crisis. \u201cThey argue that an invasion is happening, that it is us against Islam,\u201d Mr. Neumann said.\nHe said: \u201cIf you relentlessly speak about an existential threat, you can\u2019t be surprised when some people take the logical next step and use violence. If the Muslims are invading and fighting a war against us and our identity, then there is only one answer: \u2018We have to defend ourselves.\u2019\u201d\nLike jihadist ideologues, who mark key battle dates against the crusaders, Generation Identity commemorates dates when Europeans fought back foreign \u2014 and often Muslim \u2014 invaders.\n\u201cOur ancestors protected Vienna,\u201d Mr. Sellner said in an earlier interview last fall. \u201cNow it\u2019s our turn.\u201d\nThe movement\u2019s symbol is the Greek lambda, which is said to have marked the shields of Spartans when they fought back Persian invaders in 480 B.C. Every September in Vienna, Mr. Sellner and fellow activists march in honor of Prince Eugene, who beat back the Ottomans outside Vienna in 1683.\nIt is a narrative that risks mutually reinforcing violent extremism on both sides, Mr. Neumann said.\n\u201cWhat unites jihadis and the new right is the idea that the fight has never stopped,\u201d Mr. Neumann said. \u201cWe are in a modern replay of the Crusades. This is what unites the two forms of extremism. And it mutually reinforces the narrative of Islam and West being in an existential standoff.\u201d\nMr. Sellner does not like the analogy. He prefers to compare his link to the mosque shooting suspect to that between leftist activists \u2014 his own parents once fell into that category \u2014 and leftist terrorists. Someone who talks about class struggle can hardly be held responsible for leftist militants then exploding a bomb, he said.\nIn his leather jacket and trendy horn-rimmed glasses, Mr. Sellner embodies the image makeover of the far right. He has admitted to once being a member of a neo-Nazi group, but these days, Gandhi and Martin Luther King share book shelf in his Viennese apartment. He calls himself a patriot and a democrat.\nExperts like Mr. Neumann don\u2019t buy it.\n\u201cThe presentation has changed, but the message is still racist,\u201d Mr. Neumann said. \u201cWhen they talk about European identity, they mean white Christian identity. They use friendly, progressive language, but the content is the same old.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s genuinely new, he said, \u201cis that they are increasingly globally networked.\u201d\nMr. Sellner also personifies the reach of an increasingly global movement with his close links to activists across Europe and the United States: He is engaged to Brittany Pettibone, an American YouTuber with links to the alt-right who once claimed there was a \u201cwhite genocide\u201d in South Africa.\nThe couple routinely appear on videos together, recently expressing admiration for Hungary\u2019s increasingly authoritarian prime minister, Victor Orban, and Italy\u2019s vice premier Matteo Salvini.\nIn the interview, Mr. Sellner described President Trump as \u201ca catalyst for the European right\u201d and expressed his admiration for Mr. Kurz, the Austrian chancellor, for daring to go into coalition with the far right.\nThe movement is having an influence on politicians.\nAlexander Gauland, co-leader of the far-right Alternative for Germany party, made \u2018\u2018the Great Replacement\u2019\u2019 the title of a news release in April 2017, six months before his party became the third-strongest in the German Parliament.\nThat same year, Heinz-Christian Strache, now the Austrian vice chancellor, urged voters on Facebook to replace mainstream politicians \u201cbefore they replace the Austrian population in its totality.\u201d\nHe has since deleted the post, but the fact Mr. Sellner\u2019s movement has longstanding links to the far-right Freedom party, which is now part of the Austrian government, has made any investigation into the movement particularly fraught.\nLast year, the interior minister, Herbert Kickl, who is a Freedom Party member, ordered a police raid on the domestic intelligence service, a move some interpreted as a way for the minister to find out what the security services knew about his party\u2019s far-right network.\nWhen Mr. Kurz pointedly demanded that law enforcement agencies and the justice system uncover the full extent of links to the attack in New Zealand, some saw this also as a veiled warning to his own minister.\n\u201cAny link between the Christchurch attacker and the members of Generation Identity in Austria must be brought to light unsparingly,\u201d Mr. Kurz said.\nThe police in New Zealand said Wednesday that its investigating team was making a large number of inquiries, both across New Zealand and internationally, but declined to provide details.\nMr. Sellner warned that Mr. Kurz\u2019s threat to potentially ban Generation Identity risked pushing people underground and toward greater extremism.\n\u201cWe are a patriotic movement on the nationalist right, and we are committed to nonviolence,\u201d Mr. Sellner said.\nHe said: \u201cIf you take people\u2019s right to debate away and push them underground, there is a risk of radicalization. Then people might say \u2018Tarrant is right.\u2019\u201d", "date": "March 27, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/27/world/europe/new-zealand-attack-europe-far-right.html", "tags": "suspect spotlight movement attack \u201c donation puts zealand identity europe sellner right new \u2014 far"}
