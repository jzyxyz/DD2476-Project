{"title": "A Pastry Chef Masters the Veggie Burger", "content": "Just before the rush of dinner service, the pastry chef Brooks Headley agreed to serve me a veggie burger at Del Posto\u2019s gleaming marble bar in Chelsea. In the mid-\u201990s, when Headley played drums with the Young Pioneers, he loved veggie burgers so much that he planned the punk band\u2019s tours around stops at Faque Burger in San Diego for the vegetarian diner\u2019s soy-based patty. He\u2019s still obsessed. He has served his own veggie burger to David Chang, who posted a close-up to Instagram (1.8K likes), declaring it the best he\u2019s ever tried. Questlove asked Headley to serve the burger at his food salon. And this Sunday, the guy who turned the most profoundly uncool snack on the planet into something sought after will serve his patties to the public at his first pop-up, Superiority Burger on the Lower East Side.\nThe chef, who is 42, tucks his black-and-gray hair under a paper hat, which gives him the look of a deadly serious soda jerk. He is considered one of the brainiest, most adventurous pastry chefs in the business, often pushing vegetables like celery and eggplant into his desserts. \u201cI\u2019ve never served this on a plate before,\u201d he said apologetically, putting down what appeared to be a pretty normcore burger.\nMinus the plate and white napkin, it looked like something you\u2019d get from a food truck: a little small and greasy. There was iceberg lettuce peeping out of a Martin\u2019s Rolls potato bun, a slice of tomato, some melted Muenster. \u201cYou have to eat it fast,\u201d said Headley, \u201cor it disintegrates.\u201d This was not a problem. The patty was salty and as soft as rare, fatty beef, but with crisp, deeply caramelized edges that had been smeared with honey mustard. It was very good.\nA traditional beef patty is made of muscle and fat, but veggie burgers are puck-shaped anythings. Bean and legume mashes or egg-bound grain mixtures, stretchy soy derivatives or wheat glutens. Any plant-based hodgepodge can call itself a veggie burger. Madison Foods, a Tennessee-based soy manufacturer, first harnessed the power of the hamburger as a marketing tool in 1937 when it launched the Soyburger, a canned soy-wheat loaf filled out with raw peanut flour. It probably tasted as grim as it sounds. Loma Linda Food Co. debuted its Gluten Burger in 1938 and Worthington Foods\u2019 Choplet Burger made it to grocery stores in 1945, one of the many shelf-stable cans of soy-based meat mimicry that has given veggie burgers a bad rep over the years.\nInstead of trying to imitate ground beef, which he acknowledges is impossible, Headley wants you to feel like you\u2019re eating a fast-food burger. This involves some high-level thinking about how the patty will play with every element in the burger (lettuce, tomato, bun), a certain level of salt (high) and a very precise set of textures.\n\u201cWhen I was a kid and I ate the hamburgers my mom made, I\u2019d get a gristly part and it would freak me out,\u201d he remembered. \u201cBut I wanted to have some of that sensation. So, how do you make gristle pleasant?\u201d The guy who makes the risotto at Del Posto works right next to Headley. They talk. Headley learned how to overcook some ingredients and undercook others so they could combine to give the patty that you\u2019re-almost-eating-a-real-burger quality. He tested early versions on the meat cooks \u2014 the bros of the brigade, the guys least likely to admit loving a mash of farro, barley, quinoa and brown rice. Soon they started to request it as a post-shift snack.\nHeadley is one of the few pastry chefs I know with an aversion to digital scales and measuring, which means his veggie burger is slightly different every time he makes it. The version he\u2019ll serve at Superiority Burger may vary slightly because he\u2019s an obsessive tinkerer.\nEarly on, Headley developed a Parker House roll for the burger, but wisely ditched it for ready-made Martin\u2019s Rolls. \u201cIt\u2019s a Sriracha or Nutella sort of thing,\u201d he explained, \u201cwhere even if you get the best possible stuff you can\u2019t make it like them.\u201d He\u2019s pulled beautiful lettuces from Del Posto\u2019s kitchen but found iceberg (thick, crunchy, almost completely tasteless) works better to maintain a beautiful fast-food burger illusion. In the version he set me up with at the bar, there was a slice of what he called a bottom-of-the-barrel plum tomato, roasted until sweet. \u201cOh,\u201d said the Del Posto bartender, when he saw what I was eating, \u201cnow I\u2019m craving one.\u201d\nRecently, a stranger told Headley that if it was three o\u2019clock in the morning and he were a little bit drunk, he\u2019d have no idea this was a veggie burger. \u201cI took it as a compliment,\u201d says Headley. The chef has no interest in the veggie burger as health food, which may explain why it tastes so good. This particular veggie burger isn\u2019t tasked with alleviating whatever guilt we may be carrying around. It\u2019s a squishy little sandwich that delivers some fast, intense, umami-entangled satisfaction. It just so happens to be made with vegetables.", "date": "July 15, 2014", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/15/t-magazine/del-posto-pastry-chef-brooks-headley-veggie-burger-superiority.html", "tags": "veggie burger del chef pastry \u201d masters headley posto food patty serve"}
