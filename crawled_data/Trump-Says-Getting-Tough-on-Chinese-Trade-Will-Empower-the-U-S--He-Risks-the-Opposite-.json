{"title": "Trump Says Getting Tough on Chinese Trade Will Empower the U.S. He Risks the Opposite.", "content": "LONDON \u2014 In recent history as narrated by President Trump, the United States has been fleeced and humiliated by savvier nations unrestrained by na\u00efve notions like global trading rules. Predatory powers have exploited American weakness to steal factory jobs, sowing despair.\nThe primary villain in this narrative is China, the country that Mr. Trump has placed at the center of the combative trade policy he is advancing. Steep tariffs on steel and aluminum set to take effect this week are portrayed as targeting China, even as they mostly hit other powers. In a broadening of the battle to electronics and clothing, the Trump administration is readying at least $50 billion worth of tariffs and penalties on imported Chinese goods.\nIf these demonstrations of muscle are intended to strengthen the American position in grappling with China, trade experts increasingly fret that Mr. Trump\u2019s policies are doing the opposite: They potentially diminish the place of the United States in the world by alienating allies, undermining the potential for collective action among countries nursing shared grievances with China.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be far more effective if they go together,\u201d said Meredith Crowley, an expert on international trade at the University of Cambridge in England. \u201cThe fact that the United States is doing all of this alone, it does seem to be weakening the U.S. position.\u201d\nChina\u2019s staggering economic development has indeed been propelled by trading practices that exploit gaps in international rules or breach them outright. The Communist Party government still subsidizes key industries, lavishes credit on state-owned companies and imposes barriers against foreign competitors.\nIn many major economies, steel makers are contending with a glut of low-cost product, much of it made in China. Western businesses must acquiesce to Beijing\u2019s wishes, sharing cutting-edge technology as a condition of entry to the Chinese marketplace. Frequently, the incoming technology is folded into Chinese goods that land on world markets, forcing innovators to compete against their own creations.\nThese problems are real and persistent. None are easily solved, despite the political appeal of vows to get tough with China.\nChina is an inextricable part of the global supply chain, producing the piece parts of cars, gadgets, bluejeans and practically anything else made by human hands. Its products \u2014 and, increasingly, its investment \u2014 are crucial components in every economy.\nGiven this, no single country has the power to force China to reform its ways, the thinking goes. China can get around tariffs in one nation by sending its wares elsewhere. It can buy its way into markets by wielding its largess, building infrastructure and proffering loans.\nMost experts assume that the only way to make progress in pressuring China to play fair is through collective action. Major economies must join forces, taking cases at the World Trade Organization and harmonizing their policies.\n\u201cThere are some grave concerns on China, who are massively subsidizing state-owned companies,\u201d the European Union trade minister, Cecilia Malmstrom, said in January, on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \u201cAnd there, yes, we could work with the U.S.\u201d\nYet Mr. Trump is pursuing the opposite course.\nIn one of his first acts as president, he renounced American participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade bloc forged by the Obama administration in part as a counter to China\u2019s rise. The pact included prohibitions on state subsidies, in what was supposed to be a template that could eventually influence China\u2019s commercial realities.\nMr. Trump has also attacked the World Trade Organization \u2014 the linchpin of the global trading system and the ultimate venue for collective action \u2014 even suggesting that he might revoke American participation. In a formal statement to a congressional committee on Wednesday, a top White House trade official called the W.T.O. \u201cwholly inadequate to deal with China\u2019s version of a state-dominated economy that rejects market principles.\u201d\nMr. Trump has, at least for now, exempted Canada and Mexico from the bite of his tariffs on steel and aluminum. But that is conditional on their satisfying his demands for sweetened terms in the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement.\nOthers \u2014 Argentina, Australia, Brazil, the European Union and South Korea \u2014 have won a temporary reprieve. But they did so only after intense lobbying. Stalwart allies were reduced to effectively begging to be spared from an American offensive. It does not make for fertile conditions for coalition building.\n\u201cIt takes everybody\u2019s eye off the real issue,\u201d said Chad P. Bown, a trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. \u201cNow, no one is talking about China\u2019s overcapacity on steel. When you\u2019re hitting the Europeans and the Japanese and the South Koreans on steel, how easy is it going to be for those countries to cooperate with you on forced technology transfers?\u201d\n\u201cYou would need all of these countries to agree on these issues, which requires a tremendous amount of cooperation and trust,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd there\u2019s such a dearth of that now.\u201d\nMost fundamentally, Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to cite a supposed threat to American national security as justification for the steel and aluminum tariffs has prompted allies to question the reliability of their friendship with the United States.\nChina produces only about 2 percent of the steel used in the United States, while Canada is the largest supplier. The national security justification for tariffs rests on the idea that metal is a building block of defense, and that America\u2019s access is so imperiled that it must protect domestic suppliers.\nGiven that the United States already produces some two-thirds of the steel it uses, most economists dismiss that argument as absurd. In advancing it, they say, Mr. Trump risks dealing a real national security blow to the United States by threatening the durability of its alliances.\nJapan and Germany \u2014 two major steel producers \u2014 are home to American military bases. The vast majority of the European Union\u2019s members belong to NATO. South Korea, another major source of steel, is key to the talks that Mr. Trump has said he intends to hold with North Korea to resolve the nuclear crisis.\n\u201cIt strikes me as not helpful to put these tariffs on metals against some of our most important military allies,\u201d said Ms. Crowley, the Cambridge trade expert. \u201cTrump is saying, \u2018We can\u2019t rely on you to provide high-grade steel in the event of a war.\u2019 That is a very bizarre thing to say to an ally when you have military facilities in their countries. People there might wonder: What does the average American think of my country if their president is saying we can\u2019t rely upon them?\u201d", "date": "March 22, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/22/business/trade-trump-china.html", "tags": "tough american china risks empower u.s. united steel \u201d trump chinese says trade opposite \u2014 getting"}
