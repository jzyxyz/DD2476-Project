{"title": "Raila Odinga - the man Kenyans either love or loathe", "content": "Kenya's opposition leader Raila Odinga announced that he was pulling out of the presidential election re-run set for 26 October in a media briefing surrounded by sullen and resigned faces.\nThis was in stark contrast to the wide grins and jubilation that had greeted him after the Supreme Court annulled President Uhuru Kenyatta's victory in the August poll. \nThe court's decision was a high-point for a career politician who many analysts had started to write off.\nThe decision to withdraw from the election however is a typical move from a man who has been nicknamed the enigma.\nFrom his schooling to detention after the 1982 coup attempt against retired President Daniel arap Moi, Raila Amolo Odinga, 72, has remained a mysterious figure in many ways.\nA son of Kenya's first Vice-President, Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, this year's unsuccessful bid for the presidency was his fourth and most likely his last.  \nMr Odinga evokes mixed emotions in Kenya - he is loved and loathed in equal measure. No politician divides opinion like him. \nTo his supporters, he is a democrat who has sacrificed a lot in his fight against dictatorship but others see him as a scheming and selfish person, who will do anything to gain power. \nFormer Vice-President Michael Kijana Wamalwa once described Mr Odinga's supporters as suffering from \"Railamania\" and those who hated him as suffering from \"Railaphobia\".\nHis strongest following is among his Luo community in the south-western region of Nyanza, where he was born and went to school. \nThey have given him several nicknames over the years, including Tinga (tractor), Agwambo (act of god) and Baba (father). \nAfter qualifying as a mechanical engineer in the former East Germany, Mr Odinga had a short stint as a lecturer at the University of Nairobi. \nA wealthy man by Kenyan standards, he has interests in liquid gas cylinder manufacturer, the East Africa Spectre, and ethanol production through the Kisumu Molasses Plan. \nHe also has interests in the importation and distribution of petroleum.\nMr Odinga's first attempt at the presidency was in 1997, when he performed dismally, coming third.\nHe stayed out of the presidential race in 2002, backing Mwai Kibaki to trounce Uhuru Kenyatta in elections that saw the Kanu party lose power for the first time since independence in 1963. \nMr Odinga and his supporters believe that he was robbed of victory in 2007 when he ran on the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) ticket, this time against Mr Kibaki. \nIt was that election that deteriorated into nationwide ethnic violence, which left 1,300 Kenyans dead and more than 600,000 displaced. \nMore on Kenya's elections:\nMr Odinga became prime minister under a power-sharing deal to end the post-election violence. \nHis struggle against one-party dictatorship saw him detained twice (from 1982 to 1988 and 1989 to 1991) and he holds the record for being Kenya's longest-serving detainee.\nHe was initially imprisoned for trying to stage a coup in 1982, which propelled him on to the national stage. \nWhile he denied his involvement in the coup at the time, he conceded in Enigma, a book authored by Nigerian Babafemi Badejo in 2006, that he had played a central role in it.\nHe also holds the record as the Kenyan politician who has changed political allegiances the most times.\nEach time he has moved, Mr Odinga has fashioned himself as a reformist. \nIn the August election, he ran on behalf of the National Super Alliance (Nasa), which includes all of Kenya's main opposition groups.\nIt is a big achievement that he has convinced other political heavyweights to sacrifice their own ambitions to support him in what is likely to be his final stab at the presidency. \nHe had promised that, if elected, he would serve only one term in office. \nThe astute politician that he is, Mr Odinga has been using allegory and riddles to tell his supporters how the electoral commission denied him of victory. \nHe has referred to Mr Kenyatta as a \"computer generated leader\" to push his point that the commission's system were allegedly compromised to steal the election.  \nHe says that his decision to withdraw from the race was based on the commission's refusal to make changes to its systems and to fire the officials he blames for bungling the election. \nThe commission however says that Mr Odinga's name will be on the ballot unless he fills in and submits a form which the opposition leader has said he will not do. \nHis move to withdraw from the election has so far not alienated his supporters.  They back his slogan that \"no reforms, no election.\"\nAnd Mr Odinga has called for massive protests on election day.\nIn Kenya's ethnic based politics Mr Odinga enjoys the backing of key communities - the Luo (to which he belongs), Luhya and Kamba. \nHe has managed to get supporters of Musalia Mudavadi, who ran for the election in 2013, but now backs him, to boost his numbers and avoid splitting the opposition vote.\nKalonzo Musyoka was once again Mr Odinga's running mate.  \nOranges and bananas\nMr Odinga's move to change parties has been driven by his willingness to form alliances, even at one time entering into a coalition with former President Daniel Moi, under whom he had been detained. \nBut he has stayed with the same core party, Orange Democratic Movement (ODM), since 2005. \nThe party got its name from a referendum campaign Mr Odinga led against a proposed constitution in 2005. The nays were denoted by an orange while supporters were given a banana symbol. \nMr Odinga's more creative supporters still adorn themselves with bunches of oranges.\nBut alliances are not always easy and he broke up with former President Kibaki after the 2002 election because Mr Kibaki reneged on a pre-election power-sharing deal.  \nAn astute politician and avid campaigner who is known to move crowds using parables and football commentary, Mr Odinga represented Lang'ata constituency in the capital, Nairobi, uninterrupted for 20 years. \nAnd he refused to accept that he had lost again on 8 August to Uhuru Kenyatta, the same man who beat him in the 2013 election and is the son of Kenya's first President, Jomo Kenyatta. \nMr Odinga's father, Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, served as Jomo Kenyatta's vice-president but the pair fell out and Mr Odinga quit in 1966, sparking a political rivalry that is yet to be settled.", "date": "19 October 2017", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-21587054", "tags": "loathe election opposition kenya supporters politician raila man kenyans kenyatta love either odinga time"}
