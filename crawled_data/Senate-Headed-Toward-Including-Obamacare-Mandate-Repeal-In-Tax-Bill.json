{"title": "Senate Headed Toward Including Obamacare Mandate Repeal In Tax Bill", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2015 Senate Republicans are now strongly considering including a repeal of the Obamacare individual mandate in their tax proposal, a decision that could greatly complicate the GOP\u2019s efforts to cut taxes and could arm Democrats with a major talking point against the legislation.\nRepublicans don\u2019t appear certain the individual mandate repeal will ultimately be part of their tax proposal, but it appears the Senate Finance Committee will include repeal language in the bill it reports to the floor.\n\u201cWe\u2019re optimistic that inserting the individual mandate repeal would be helpful,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told reporters Tuesday after a closed-door meeting with Republicans.\nShortly after the meeting, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) issued a press release saying the Senate Finance Committee had \u201caccepted\u201d his proposal to include the mandate repeal in the legislation \u2015 a decision the Congressional Budget Office says would save $338 billion over 10 years, allowing Republicans to finance more tax cuts.\nWhile Cotton sounded very sure of the decision, leaders were less definitive Tuesday,\u00a0suggesting this may not quite be a done deal.\nSen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), chairman of the Finance Committee that is writing the Senate\u2019s tax legislation,\u00a0told committee members to ignore the question of whether leaders would ultimately include a repeal in the bill.\n\u201cNo one needs to be talking about the individual mandate at this point,\u201d Hatch said Tuesday. \u201cArguments, questions or statements about the individual mandate are a distraction from the meeting we\u2019re having now, and, frankly, they\u2019re a waste of this committee\u2019s time.\u201d\nWhen Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) asked Hatch if the repeal would be in the bill, Hatch refused to say.\nOther senators reported Tuesday that the decision is still up in the air.\nSen. John Kennedy (R-La.), who supports including the mandate repeal in the bill, said no decision has been made.\n\u201cIf we include the mandate ... that will go a long way to solving this problem \u2014 probably would solve the problem,\u201d Kennedy said of issues concerning how much Republicans can add to the debt in their tax bill, which they hope to pass under a process called reconciliation that requires only a simple majority of votes.\nUnder the agreement made for the reconciliation bill, Republicans can add only $1.5 trillion to the debt if they are to pass the tax bill with 50 votes (and a tie-breaking vote from Vice President Mike Pence). The extra money saved by repealing the individual mandate would help the GOP finance a number of other cuts, but it would also open up Republicans to the Democratic talking point that they\u2019re paying for tax cuts by dismantling health care.\nIncluding the repeal could also jeopardize the bill\u2019s passage.\nOne of the three Republicans who voted against an Obamacare repeal over the summer, Sen. Susan Collins (Maine), said Tuesday that she would wait to see what ultimately comes to the floor, but she believes including a portion of the health care repeal in this legislation would hurt the tax bill, not help it.\n\u201cI personally think that it complicates tax reform to put the repeal of the individual mandate in there,\u201d Collins said, \u201cparticularly if it\u2019s done before the Alexander-Murray bill passes.\u201d\nThe Alexander-Murray legislation\u00a0is the bipartisan health care stabilization bill \u2015 brokered between Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.) \u2015 that would fund the so-called cost-sharing reductions for insurers offering low-income people discounts while also giving states more flexibility on the plans they offer.\nRepublican Conference Chairman John Thune (S.D.) told reporters that part of the agreement moving forward is for the Senate to pass the Alexander-Murray legislation in exchange for including the mandate repeal in the tax bill. That agreement, however, seems fragile, as some GOP senators don\u2019t seem to have completely signed off on the deal, and McConnell can afford to lose only two Republicans if he\u2019s going to pass the tax proposal through reconciliation.\nSen. John McCain (Ariz.), another one of the three Republicans who opposed the Obamacare repeal over the summer, repeatedly told reporters Tuesday that he would have to see the final proposal before he decides whether he can support the bill, and Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) has been cagey about whether she could support the tax measure if it includes the mandate repeal.\nThe other issue is the House.\u00a0Before the announcement in the Senate on Tuesday, passage of the House\u2019s tax proposal, which doesn\u2019t include a mandate repeal, appeared to be on a glide path.\u00a0A decision in the Senate to include repeal may give some Republicans pause.\u00a0And this ultimately could be a gambit by McConnell, with him perhaps reversing the decision to include the mandate repeal if it means he would have the votes from otherwise reluctant senators.\nWhen HuffPost asked Collins on Monday whether there was already some pressure on her to accept this tax proposal because it didn\u2019t, at the time, include the mandate repeal, Collins suggested keeping the mandate repeal out of the tax cut bill was a selling point for her.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a mistake to combine them,\u201d Collins said, \u201cbecause I think it means we\u2019ll get no Democratic votes, and I\u2019d like this to be bipartisan.\u201d\nThis post has been updated with quotes from Hatch and Kennedy.", "date": "\n11/14/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/senate-republicans-obamacare-repeal-tax-reform_n_5a0b4c88e4b0bc648a0e6dcd?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009", "tags": "mandate tax obamacare repeal republicans \u201d including headed senate bill toward include"}
