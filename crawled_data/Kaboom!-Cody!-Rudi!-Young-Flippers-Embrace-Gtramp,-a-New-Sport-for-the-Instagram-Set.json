{"title": "Kaboom! Cody! Rudi! Young Flippers Embrace Gtramp, a New Sport for the Instagram Set", "content": "Waterford, Mich. \u2014 On a balmy July afternoon, seven teenage boys stand around a backyard trampoline taking turns bouncing. It\u2019s the kind of scene that might be repeated at countless suburban homes, except that these kids aren\u2019t doing seat drops and belly flops. \nThey\u2019re doing triple, quadruple, even quintuple flips (yes, that\u2019s five rotations in the air). The boys bounce a breathtaking 12 feet in the air and embellish their moves with multiple twists and an array of skills with names like kaboom, cody, ball-out, fliffus, rudi and randy. They are elite athletes, mostly self-taught, who connected via social media and are now pushing themselves to learn more and more difficult skills on the trampoline. \nIt\u2019s a movement being led by tween and teenage boys around the world \u2014 with a sprinkling of girls joining in \u2014 and it\u2019s called Gtramp, short for garden trampoline, to distinguish it from the Olympic sport of trampoline. \nGtramp is renegade in nature, blending the countercultural aspect of skateboarding with the raw daring of parkour and the energy of freestyle snowboarding, all of it fueled by the new technology that is second nature to this new generation.\n\u201cI still get told all the time to play a normal sport,\u201d says Cam Shorey (@camshorey77), a 15-year-old from Andover, Mass., whose skill in Gtramp has won him a sponsorship by SkyBound USA, the trampoline maker. Like many of his fellow flippers, as they call themselves, he says he is often teased at school, subject to eye-rolls from kids and parents alike. \u201cI use the negative things people say to me as motivation to get better,\u201d he says.\nGtramp has exploded in popularity over the past two years. The hashtag #gtramp, obscure only a few years ago, now has more than 70,000 posts on Instagram, where participants share their progress via photos and video and encourage one other. The powerful combination of social media, along with the accessibility of apps for video editing, trampoline brand sponsorships and, most importantly, the kids themselves has helped fuel sport\u2019s growth. \nThey are a fiercely loyal band of athletes who care about and support one another. They may train in their own backyards and basements, but through videos and live streams remain intimately connected. To the chagrin of organized gymnastics, these athletes have taken training into their own hands and forged a tightly knit community in the process \u2014  all without the rules, the governing body or the coaches. \nInstead, Gtramp has brands, formal and informal \u201cmeet-ups,\u201d endless live streams and videos on Instagram, and a growing pool of talent that can make a parent gasp.\nI should know, because my 9-year-old son is one of them.\nMy son, Maxx, took gymnastics in first grade, but quickly got bored. He was more interested in teaching himself flips on our trampoline by watching YouTube videos. Eventually, I helped him set up his own Instagram account, (@maxx_flipzz) where he follows his idols \u2014 teenage flippers with 20,000, 50,000, 100,000 and more followers \u2014 and posts his own tricks. \nI used to bemoan it, especially since I had been a gymnast. But spending time with Gtramp athletes like 15-year-old Colby Iverson has changed my mind.  \nColby discovered flipping about three years ago when his parents surprised him with a trampoline for his birthday. He was a strong athlete \u2014 he had been playing hockey since he was 4 \u2014 but was a beginner at the trampoline. He quickly taught himself a front flip and a back flip, and then he discovered Tanner Braungardt, a teenage YouTuber who makes videos featuring his extreme flips. \nTanner\u2019s videos inspired Colby, who began teaching himself more complicated skills and posting them on Instagram. \u201cThat\u2019s when I found the Gtramp community,\u201d he says. \u201cEvery day, I would go out there and flip and then edit on my phone at night.\u201d\nWhen Colby (@colbyiverson) began to excel at the sport and build up an Instagram following, the trampoline brand AlleyOOP reached out to sponsor him. As a sponsored athlete, he has traveled around the country for events, as well as internationally to Sweden and Denmark. During the school year, he trains after school and on weekends. During the summer, he spends entire days on his AlleyOOP trampoline, jumping off a tower his dad custom built to get a higher bounce. Typical of the community, Colby doesn\u2019t have a coach. \u201cI get to progress at my own rate and take it to my own personal level,\u201d he says.\u2019\nColby\u2019s parents, Craig and Kallee Iverson, didn\u2019t understand what their son was doing at first, and the high-flying flips and twists they saw him practicing made them nervous. \u201cWe didn\u2019t understand the level he planned on taking this to,\u201d says Mr. Iverson. \nBut they saw the skill and caution he was bringing \u2014 and still brings \u2014 to learning the complicated tricks. The majority of Gtramp athletes take training and safety seriously, often (but not always) using nets on the trampolines, warming up thoroughly before trying difficult skills, and working hard to build up the strength and awareness they need. \n\u201cColby will watch videos of himself over and over again until he\u2019s got it. He spends an amazing amount of time prepping skills,\u201d Mr. Iverson says.\nBut impose structure on them, and they\u2019re not interested. \u201cEverybody is pushing kids toward organized sports and to be the next great thing, and I think this is a minor revolt,\u201d Mr. Iverson says.\nThis summer, with support from AlleyOOP, the Iversons hosted the second annual Great Lakes Meet Up at their home in Waterford, Mich., inviting about 30 top Gtramp athletes \u2014 along with Maxx and me \u2014  to come in waves over two weeks. The boys, who ranged in age from 14 to 18, quickly got down to the business of \u201cseshing\u201d (\u201csesh\u201d is short for session, and often used as a verb), taking turns trying new combinations of skills or perfecting old ones, all the time cheering one another on.\n\u201cWe all support each other, and we all celebrate together,\u201d says 15-year-old Lukas White (@_lukaswhite), who lives in Santa Monica, Calif., and is also sponsored by AlleyOOP. \nWhen they come together, their goal is to support one another in learning new skills, or achieving what they call \u201cworld\u2019s firsts.\u201d (The rules for a world\u2019s first are thus: you have to get it on video and post it; if someone else in the Gtramp community has done it, they will quickly correct you.) \nThe boys have remarkably similar stories. Many tried organized gymnastics but got bored. Some have cheerleading or martial arts backgrounds. One of the flippers there, Nicholas Cassell (@_nicholasbcassell), who is 16 and lives in Knoxville, Tenn., is an elite competitive diver. \nZ Zoromba (@fliplikez), another flipper I talked to at a trampoline event in June in Cincinnati, was an elite gymnast in the United States after moving here from Egypt when he was 10. \n\u201cI was 12 and I was getting ready to go to Nationals, but I felt like gymnastics was holding me back,\u201d says Z, now 18, living in Santa Monica and making a living by touring with a group of other \u201ctrickers,\u201d as they call themselves, including brothers Jack Payne and Bailey Payne (tricking blends martial arts, flipping, parkour and break dancing moves). The Payne brothers both come from a competitive cheerleading background, and they bring a message of being your unique self in your athletics. \n\u201cWe want to engage with kids and help them learn,\u201d says Bailey Payne, 22, who is sponsored by Red Bull and holds what is regarded as a world record for doing 28 one-legged flips (\u201ccorks\u201d) in a row. \nThough these budding athletes often face discouragement, it seems no obstacle can stop a flipper who wants to flip. Luke Mattson (@luke.mattson), a 15-year-old who lives in Minnesota, has built up a huge Instagram following by doing all of his tricks inside on mini-tramps and mattresses since the townhouse where he lives can\u2019t accommodate an outdoor trampoline.\nThough Gtramp is a boy-centric sport, there are girls involved, too. Most girls who show interest are steered toward organized gymnastics, but a few who have made headway in the Gtramp community include @thegirlninja, @flippin.samantha and @flipssophie.\nThe backyard trampoline brands are mostly scrambling to catch up and trying to figure out how to support the community. Different brands have different approaches. AlleyOOP (owned by JumpSport) tends to focus on sponsoring athletes. SkyBound USA, in addition to sponsoring athletes, also holds meet-ups and events such as the GT Games, billed as \u201cthe world\u2019s first official freestyle trampoline competition.\u201d The second GT Games was held in Escondido, Calif., in late June, and more than 50 Gtramp athletes were invited to compete. \nThere was hesitation about the idea of competing against one another, says Ricky Lai, marketing manager for SkyBound USA. \u201cBut it\u2019s more like a friendly gantlet than a cutthroat competition. The idea is to bring the athletes together, to showcase the best in sport and present it to the world.\u201d Now it\u2019s become an event the community embraces.\nGreg Roe, 28, a former elite gymnast and Team Canada Trampolinist, was the one who brought the concept of the GT Games to SkyBound USA and asked them to partner with him to create it. He is trying to bridge the chasm between organized gymnastics and Gtramp. \u201cWe want to build a little bit of structure around the industry with these events, but we\u2019re not trying to tell the athletes what to do or how to do it,\u201d says Mr. Roe, who founded Greg Roe Trampoline, which focuses on bringing safety to trampoline parks and also sponsors athletes as part of its GRTCrew, which consists of 26 athletes from around the world (including Colby Iverson and Cam Shorey).\nThe Finnish brand Acon has decided to eschew competitions and take a more artistic approach, says Marko Manninen, vice president and head of sales and marketing for Acon Global. He\u2019s sponsoring a team of athletes to travel and create videos. \u201cThe main idea is that we have fun together,\u201d Mr. Manninen says. \nThis past year, he has been working on making a series of videos featuring Sam De Greef (@samdegreef), including a trek through Finland in search of the best trampoline photograph ever. Sam is a 17-year-old Gtramp athlete who lives in the Netherlands, is self-taught and has been flipping for about four years. \u201cI love Gtramp so much because I feel free. I get to discover on my own what I can do,\u201d he says. \nTrampoline parks are in the game, too. Last year, trampoline parks were a $1.4-billion industry in the United States; by 2023, that\u2019s expected to grow to $3.25 billion, says Case Lawrence, founder and chief executive of CircusTrix, the largest developer, operator and franchiser of trampoline parks in the world. \u201cWe see a lot of similarity between Gtramp and the skateboarding subculture of late 1970s and \u201980s. It\u2019s a meet-up community with its own language,\u201d he says. \nThey\u2019ve enjoyed watching the community and learning about it. \u201cOur role now is to listen and provide some organization and institutionalization for it,\u201d Mr. Lawrence says. To that end, CircusTrix sponsors FlipCon, an annual Las Vegas meet-up event for the flipping and tricking community. Many of the big names in Gtramp are there and it generates a lot of excitement and energy for the sport.\nAlso, to make sure to keep appealing to the newer breed of renegade flipper, CircusTrix is currently rebranding many of its parks (it owns about 300). The new name it has chosen is representative of Gtramp culture: Defy. \nAll of the athletes told me their parents are supportive now, but it took a while to get there. I understand this, because at first, I tried to forbid Maxx to try certain skills, like double flips. But I watched the way he worked the progression on his own, and eventually realized that he had excellent awareness \u2014 and that the videos he was watching on Instagram were truly helping him learn in a safe way and inspiring him to take it seriously. \nStill, safety is the largest point of contention, and the most frightening aspect for parents, as well as the kids themselves.\nLast fall, a 17-year-old Gtramper, Joshua Southworth, broke his neck in a trampoline accident, leaving him paralyzed and his family nearly destitute with medical bills (there is a GoFundMe set up for him). The night I first learned about Joshua, I didn\u2019t sleep. Maxx getting injured is a constant worry of mine. \n\u201cWe noticed a few years ago that the tricks were getting really big,\u201d says Acon\u2019s Marko Manninen. \u201cAt first, we were afraid, but then we started to think about how we could support the safety side of trampoline tricking.\u201d \nSimply handing down rules wouldn\u2019t work, so Mr. Manninen started working with influencers like Sam De Greef to push out subtle safety messages, like using #NDB on posts. That means \u201cno double bounce.\u201d Double bouncing is when one person bounces on the trampoline mat at just the right time to send the other person higher in a bounce (think of a teeter-totter). \nDouble bouncing can send kids too high and make them lose control of the jump, since someone else is responsible for the timing. It can lead to injury. While there is still widespread double bouncing in the Gtramp community (including by my own kid), more of the influencers are moving away from it, and as they do and they post #NDB, it trickles down.\nWhen I ask the boys about the potential of getting seriously hurt, they know it\u2019s a possibility, and just as athletes in any sport would, these elite Gtrampers take precautions and train for tricks until they know they can safely do them. At one point during the meet-up, I watch Cam Shorey try a difficult combination at least a dozen times, stopping each time before the final trick because he didn\u2019t think he could make it. Though he was frustrated each time, he didn\u2019t want to throw something he wasn\u2019t sure he could do.\nAt the meet up, the boys take time to work with Maxx and encourage him, not because they have to, but because they truly want to. For the Iversons, this is the driving force behind Gtramp, and why they have decided to get involved and support it, ultimately helping these athletes connect in person beyond the posts on Instagram. \n\u201cThese kids are almost all genuinely in it for each other,\u201d says Mr. Iverson. \u201cThis is more of a team than any team Colby has been on.\u201d \nJudi Ketteler writes about parenting active kids and making the most of midlife.
