{"title": "Judge Blocks Kentucky Fetal Heartbeat Law That Bans Abortion After 6 Weeks", "content": "A federal judge on Friday temporarily blocked a Kentucky law that prohibits abortion after a fetal heartbeat is detected, which typically happens around six weeks into pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant.\nThe measure, which was signed into law on Friday by the state\u2019s Republican governor, Matt Bevin, and was set to take effect immediately, was poised to become one of the strictest anti-abortion laws in the country.\nBut late on Friday, the judge, David J. Hale of the Western District of Kentucky, ruled the law was potentially unconstitutional. He halted enforcement for at least 14 days to \u201cprevent irreparable harm\u201d until he could hold a hearing.\nThe ruling came amid a yearslong effort to curb abortions in Kentucky, which has one remaining abortion clinic. Several other states are considering similar measures, known as heartbeat bills, as states move to restrict \u2014 or shore up access to \u2014 abortion in anticipation of a more conservative Supreme Court possibly ruling on the issue.\nThe Kentucky law was one of two measures seeking to restrict abortion that were passed by the state\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature this week but are now being contested. The other, a bill that prohibits abortion if a woman wants to end her pregnancy because of the diagnosis of a disability in the fetus, among other reasons, is awaiting approval from the governor.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union challenged both measures in a lawsuit filed this week on behalf of EMW Women\u2019s Surgical Center, the state\u2019s only licensed abortion clinic.\n\u201cWe think this is a very straightforward legal issue,\u201d Brigitte Amiri, deputy director of the A.C.L.U.\u2019s Reproductive Freedom Project, said on Saturday. \u201cStates can\u2019t ban abortion. It has been well settled over 40 years ago in Roe v. Wade.\u201d\nThe judge on Friday did not address the second bill and Ms. Amiri said the group planned to ask the judge for a ruling on it after it was signed into law.\nSteve Pitt, general counsel to the governor, said on Saturday that ruling was not unexpected \u201cgiven the minimal amount of briefing that has occurred.\u201d\n\u201cThis case or others like it from other states will result in major changes in abortions in the U.S. in the near future,\u201d he said. \u201cThe A.C.L.U., Planned Parenthood and others favoring unlimited abortions know this and are in a panic.\u201d\nThe governor has made anti-abortion legislation a priority of his administration and has welcomed the chance to fight for protections in court.\nIn a video message on Friday, he chided his \u201cgood friends at the A.C.L.U.\u201d for challenging the second bill, which would ban abortions based on a fetus\u2019s disability, sex or race, before it had been signed into law and suggested they needed a civics refresher from \u201cSchoolhouse Rock!\u201d on how legislation works.\n\u201cThey frankly don\u2019t care whether they are following the law or not,\u201d said Mr. Bevin, who has expressed support for the bill. \u201cThey simply want to push their ideology.\u201d\nThe landscape of the Supreme Court changed last year after Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, seen as a reliable conservative, replaced the court\u2019s longtime swing vote, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who retired. The change added urgency to the question of whether Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 ruling that made abortion legal nationwide, would survive the Trump administration.\nBut legal experts have suggested that any developments, at least in the near term, will most likely come at the state level, with states succeeding in smaller cases that limit \u2014 but not eliminate \u2014 the right to an abortion. Other states, including Iowa and North Dakota, have passed similarly prohibitive fetal heartbeat measures only to have them swiftly voided by the courts as unconstitutional.\nSupreme Court decisions have given women a right to abortion until a fetus is viable outside the womb, usually around 24 weeks into pregnancy.\nMs. Amiri said the fetal heartbeat bill would effectively eliminate abortion in Kentucky. About 90 percent of abortions in the state are performed after six weeks, according to the lawsuit. The law would make an exception for procedures that were necessary to prevent death or serious risk to the woman.\nShe said Judge Hale\u2019s ruling came as a \u201ctremendous relief.\u201d\n\u201cThe clinic sees patients today, and before we got the ruling yesterday, they were in the process of canceling appointments,\u201d Ms. Amiri said on Saturday. \u201cIt means they will be able to provide care today and that is incredibly important to every person who comes to the clinic.\u201d", "date": "March 16, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/16/us/kentucky-fetal-heartbeat-abortion-law.html", "tags": "blocks kentucky heartbeat weeks judge states \u201d ruling abortion friday bans fetal law"}
