{"title": "Brexit: What trade deals has the UK done so far?", "content": "As a European Union member, the UK is automatically part of about 40 trade agreements which the EU has with more than 70 countries. \nIf the UK leaves the EU without a deal it would lose these trade deals immediately. \nTo avoid this, Theresa May's government says it wants to replicate the EU's trade agreements \"as far as possible\" and have them ready to go in the event of a no-deal Brexit.\nThe government says the EU's negotiated deals with other countries are worth about 11% of total UK trade. \nLiam Fox, the international trade secretary, told MPs in January last year that the government wanted to achieve \"continuity and stability\" by ensuring that the UK would continue to benefit from these arrangements.\nSo how much progress has been made?\nSo far the UK has agreed nine \"continuity\" deals. These are: \nThe agreements vary in scope but they include relaxing certain rules, reducing taxes (tariffs) on imports, or granting easier market access.\nOn 21 February, the government released a statement saying it would not be able to the replicate the EU's free trade deal with Japan. Other agreements that won't be ready, according to the statement, are Turkey, Andorra and San Marino.\nThe agreement, signed on 2 April, maintains the same level of tariffs on goods traded between the UK, Iceland and Norway.\nTotal trade (imports and exports) between the UK and Norway was worth \u00a330bn in 2017, according to the Department for International Trade. For Iceland, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show total trade was worth \u00a31.8bn in 2017.\nThe Department for International Trade says UK businesses will benefit from lower import prices, such as aluminium and some fuel and oil products.\nThe deal with the Caribbean states (known as the Cariforum) covers 11 countries, including Barbados and Jamaica, and was signed on 22 March.\nA further three countries, including the Bahamas, have agreed to the deal in principle and are \"expected to sign shortly\", according to the Department for International Trade.\nThe deal eliminates all tariffs from the signing countries and allows businesses to trade as they currently do.\nExporters of rum, bananas and sugar cane are all expected to benefit from the arrangement.\nTotal trade between the UK and the region was worth around \u00a32.5bn in 2017.\nThe deal with the Pacific Islands - covering Fiji and Papua New Guinea - was signed on 14 March. \nThe UK says the deal will gradually remove around 80% of tariffs on UK exports to these countries and maintain access to goods, such as fish and sugar.\nIn 2017, total trade between the UK and the region was worth around \u00a3369m.\nThe government says other countries in the region will be allowed to request to join the UK-Pacific Agreement in the future.\nThe deal was formally signed on 18 February. It allows businesses to continue to trade as they do now after 29 March - without any additional tariffs or barriers.  \nThe government says the agreement could save the UK vehicle industry up to \u00a39m a year in tariff charges.\nAccording to the ONS, total trade between the UK and Israel was worth \u00a33.9bn in 2017.\nThe UK-Palestinian Authority agreement was signed by Liam Fox and Abeer Odeh, Minister of National Economy in Ramallah on 18 February.\nTotal trade between the two was \u00a325m in 2017, according to ONS figures.\nThe UK government says the deal will benefit Palestinian exporters of fruit, nuts and olive oil. \nUnder the UK-Switzerland agreement, which was confirmed in Bern on 11 February, tariffs will continue to be avoided on the vast majority of goods traded between the two countries. \nWithout the deal, the UK government says the motor industry could have faced up to \u00a38m in tariff charges, while aluminium exporters could have faced up to \u00a34m.\nThe Department for International Trade says that trade between the UK and Switzerland was worth \u00a332.1bn in 2017 - accounting for about 2.5% of total UK trade.\nAn additional agreement was also signed in Bern by Liechtenstein's Minister for Foreign Affairs, Aurelia Frick. It applies the main parts of the Swiss-UK trade deal to her country too.\nThe Faroe Islands is the UK's 114th largest trading partner, according to the government. Total trade between the two countries was worth \u00a3236m in 2017.\nFish and crustaceans made up the vast majority of UK's imports from the Faroes in 2017, worth \u00a3201.7m, while total UK exports to the country were worth only \u00a36m - mostly machinery and mechanical appliances.\nThe UK government says that the agreement it has reached will mean consumers continue to benefit from greater choice and lower fish prices \"such as Atlantic salmon, haddock and halibut\".\nTrade between the Eastern and Southern Africa (ESA) region was worth \u00a31.5bn in 2017 - about 0.1% of total UK trade. The UK-ESA deal covers Madagascar, Mauritius, Seychelles and Zimbabwe. \nMeat and fish are the main goods imported from the region by the UK (\u00a3111m). \nSigned at the end of January, the UK-Chile trade arrangement was the first to be done. Total trade between the UK and Chile was \u00a31.8bn in 2017. \nFruit, nuts and drinks are the top goods imported by the UK. The government says the deal will help to protect parts of the UK's wine industry.\nThe UK has also signed deals with the United States, Australia and New Zealand, but these are \"mutual recognition agreements\" and not free trade agreements.\nThe Australia and New Zealand deal replicates all aspects of the current EU agreements when it comes to recognising product standards, such as the labelling and certifying of wine.\nThe US agreement will, according to the Department for International Trade, particularly benefit the pharmaceutical sector which accounts for around \u00a37.7bn of UK exports to the US - about 18% of the total. \nSo there's been some progress, but not yet enough. \n\"You can't simply roll over everything - these existing agreements will have references to EU law, so you cannot avoid some negotiation,\" says Alan Winters, director of the UK Trade Policy Observatory at University of Sussex.  \nSome countries may also be apprehensive in signing deals right now, given that it is so unclear what Brexit will ultimately look like, adds Prof Winters.\nSo what could the consequences be if trade arrangements are not fully in place and the UK leaves the EU with no deal?\nWith the countries where the UK has no formal trade agreement, both would have to trade under the rules overseen by the World Trade Organization (WTO).\nTrade would not stop if this were to happen but some barriers would go up, says Alex Stojanovic, from the Institute for Government think tank.\n\"There is a reason you have trade agreements, it's that they give you better trade preferences than WTO terms.\n\"So some businesses will be harmed by tariffs coming into play,\" he says. \nRead more from Reality Check\nSend us your questions\nFollow us on Twitter", "date": "5 April 2019", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-47213842", "tags": "brexit agreement deals uk countries says trade worth agreements done total far deal government"}
