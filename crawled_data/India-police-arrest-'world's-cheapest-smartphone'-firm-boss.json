We want to investigate these claims thoroughly,\" he said. \n\"It's important for us to expose these scams because innocent people end up losing their hard-earned money. \n\"We are seeing an increasing number of technology-related frauds. I appeal to people to be sure before investing money into such schemes.\"\nRinging Bells first started taking money for the phones in February last year, initially promising delivery by June. \nDemand for the cheap handset, which it sold through its own website, caused the company's servers to crash. \nAt the launch, Mr Goel had said the phone would be locally made as part of the Make in India program, promoted aggressively by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government. \nBut there were plenty of questions around the firm's business model, with many asking how it could be offered so cheaply. Several analysts have described the phone as a \"ponzi scheme\".", "date": "24 February 2017", "href": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-39074037", "tags": "claimed india smartphone arrest firm boss bells money cheapest indian police ringing phone goel"}
