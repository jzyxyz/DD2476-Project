{"title": "Mattis Tries to Put Brakes on Possible Syria Strike, to \u2018Keep This From Escalating\u2019", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Defense Secretary Jim Mattis sought on Thursday to slow down an imminent strike on Syria, reflecting mounting concerns at the Pentagon that a concerted bombing campaign could escalate into a wider conflict between Russia, Iran and the West.\nDuring a closed-door White House meeting, officials said, Mr. Mattis pushed for more evidence of President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s role in a suspected chemical attack last weekend that would assure the world that military action was necessary.\nDespite the caution, two Defense Department officials predicted it would be difficult to pull back from punishing airstrikes, given President Trump\u2019s threat on Twitter a day earlier of American missiles that \u201cwill be coming, nice and new and \u2018smart.\u2019\u201d\nMr. Mattis publicly raised the warning on Thursday morning, telling the House Armed Services Committee that retaliation must be balanced against the threat of a wider war.\n\u201cWe are trying to stop the murder of innocent people,\u201d Mr. Mattis said. \u201cBut on a strategic level, it\u2019s how do we keep this from escalating out of control \u2014 if you get my drift on that.\u201d\nHours later, after Mr. Mattis detailed his concerns at the White House, the president\u2019s top national security advisers ended an afternoon meeting without a decision to attack, said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the press secretary.\nDiplomatic efforts continued deep into the evening, with Mr. Trump agreeing in a phone call with Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain that \u201cit was vital that the use of chemical weapons did not go unchallenged,\u201d Downing Street said in a statement. The two leaders committed to \u201ckeep working closely together on the international response,\u201d the statement said.\nMr. Trump was also expected to speak on Thursday with President Emmanuel Macron of France, the other key ally weighing military action.\nDefense Department officials said Mr. Mattis urged consideration of a wider strategy. They said he sought to persuade allies to commit to immediate help after striking Mr. Assad\u2019s government in response to Saturday\u2019s suspected chemical weapons attack on a suburb of Damascus, the capital.\nNikki R. Haley, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, said that \u201cwe definitely have enough proof\u201d of a chemical weapons attack.\n\u201cBut now, we just have to be thoughtful in our action,\u201d Ms. Haley told Andrea Mitchell of NBC News.\nIn the White House meeting, according to three administration officials, Mr. Mattis said the United States, Britain and France must provide convincing proof that the Syrian government used chemical weapons to attack the rebel-held town of Douma, where more than 40 people died and hundreds were sickened.\nIt was an acknowledgment of a lesson from the Iraq war about what can go wrong after a military assault without a plan, one senior Defense Department official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive plans. It also sought to ensure that the United States and European allies could justify the strike to the world in the face of withering criticism by Russia \u2014 Mr. Assad\u2019s most powerful partner.\n\u201cDefense officials are right to worry about escalation,\u201d said Kori Schake, a former national security aide to President George W. Bush and author of a book with Mr. Mattis.\n\u201cThe Russians are heavily invested in sustaining Bashar Assad in power, have made their case as the essential power in the Middle East, and a U.S. or allied strike would be a reminder of how much stronger the West is than Russia,\u201d Ms. Schake said.\nMr. Mattis also assured House lawmakers that they would be notified before any strikes against Syrian weapons facilities and airfields. The Pentagon alerted lawmakers before an April 2017 cruise missile attack on Shayrat air base after a similar chemical attack on Syrian civilians.\nBefore the White House meeting, Mr. Trump told reporters he would make a decision \u201cfairly soon\u201d about a strike. Earlier, in a tweet, he insisted that he had never telegraphed the timing of an attack on Syria, which \u201ccould be very soon or not so soon at all!\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking very, very seriously, very closely at that whole situation and we\u2019ll see what happens, folks, we\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d he told reporters at the White House.\n\u201cIt\u2019s too bad that the world puts us in a position like that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you know, as I said this morning, we\u2019ve done a great job with ISIS,\u201d Mr. Trump added. \u201cWe have just absolutely decimated ISIS. But now we have to make some further decisions. So they\u2019ll be made fairly soon.\u201d\nIn Paris, Mr. Macron cited unspecified proof that the Syrian government had used chemical weapons in Douma, and said that France was working in close coordination with the Trump administration on the issue.\n\u201cWe have proof that last week, 10 days ago even, chemical weapons were used \u2014 at least chlorine \u2014 and that they were used by the regime of Bashar al-Assad,\u201d Mr. Macron said in an interview on TF1, a French television station.\nBut time may be of the essence in London, where Britain\u2019s Parliament will return from its Easter vacation on Monday. Although Mrs. May is under no legal obligation to consult Parliament before ordering any military action, her predecessors have done so in recent years.\nLawmakers from both Mrs. May\u2019s Conservative Party and the opposition Labour Party have demanded to be consulted before strikes.\nGermany announced that it would not be part of any coordinated military action in Syria, even as Chancellor Angela Merkel stressed the importance of a message from the West that using chemical weapons \u201cis unacceptable.\u201d\n\u201cGermany will not take part in possible military action \u2014 I want to make clear again that there are no decisions,\u201d Ms. Merkel said in Berlin.\nThe White House meeting included John R. Bolton, the new national security adviser, who favored strikes against Mr. Assad when ordered last year by Mr. Trump but opposed them in 2013 when considered by President Barack Obama.\nEven with Mr. Mattis\u2019s urging of caution, administration officials said it was hard to envision that Mr. Trump would not move ahead with strikes, given that he has promised retaliation.\n\u201cIn my view, the train has left the station,\u201d said Cliff Kupchan, chairman of the Eurasia Group, a political risk consulting and advisory firm. \u201cIf Trump now decides not to strike, he\u2019s Obama 2.0 from 2013. That\u2019s the ultimate anathema to President Trump, and I expect him to hit Syria in the next few days.\u201d\nMr. Trump has previously belittled American leaders for giving the enemy advance warning of a strike. Heeding Mr. Trump\u2019s warning on Wednesday about an American response, Syria has moved military aircraft to the Russian base near Latakia, and is working to protect important weapons systems.\nRussian and Iranian forces are stationed in Syria, ostensibly to support Mr. Assad\u2019s fight against Islamic State extremists whom he considers part of the rebellion that has sought to oust him in the country\u2019s seven-year war.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s delay in acting has given the Russians and Iranians more time to prepare for an American strike.\nThis month, Mr. Trump surprised even his own advisers when he said he wanted to immediately withdraw the estimated 2,000 American troops that are currently in Syria, where they are focused on fighting the Islamic State. He softened that demand hours later after a National Security Council meeting, setting a goal of bringing the troops home within a few months.\nSaturday\u2019s attack, however, enraged the president, and he promised a decision on a response this week.\nMr. Macron also said France would continue to push for a cease-fire at the United Nations and for humanitarian aid for Syrian civilians to avoid what he described as \u201cthe terrible images of crimes that we saw, with children and women who were dying by suffocation, because they were subjected to chlorine.\u201d\nThe French have warplanes equipped with cruise missiles in Jordan and in the United Arab Emirates, which are within striking range of Syria.", "date": "April 12, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/12/us/politics/trump-syria-attack.html", "tags": "put possible syria \u2018 tries escalating brakes \u201d mattis chemical strike attack weapons said keep"}
