{"title": "Myanmar Sentences Reuters Journalists to 7 Years in Prison", "content": "BANGKOK \u2014 The two reporters met the police corporal at his insistence, joining him at a restaurant in Yangon. Confused when the conversation did not live up to the policeman\u2019s initial urgency, the two got up to leave after the meal ended, only to have him hand off two rolled-up pieces of paper with no explanation.\nThe journalists, U Wa Lone and U Kyaw Soe Oo, reporters for Reuters, barely made it out of the restaurant before they were arrested, the papers confiscated before they had any chance to look at them, they testified.\nBut on Monday, those papers \u2014 despite testimony in April by another police official that higher-ups had ordered them to be planted on the reporters \u2014 were at the heart of a judge\u2019s rationale in convicting and sentencing the two journalists to seven years in prison for violating Myanmar\u2019s colonial-era Official Secrets Act.\nTheir case, which has stretched over almost nine months of court hearings, has become the most notable blow in Myanmar\u2019s intensified crackdown on the press, as officials seek to deny or obscure atrocities against the country\u2019s Rohingya Muslim minority. A United Nations mission recently called for Myanmar military leaders to be tried for genocide against the Rohingya.\nThe reporters\u2019 defenders, including news organizations and rights groups from around the world, say their only crime was committing journalism, documenting the mass killings and ethnic cleansing by soldiers and Buddhist mobs in Rakhine State that began in August last year.\nTheir lawyers argued that all the documents cited by the judge in convicting and sentencing Mr. Wa Lone and Mr. Kyaw Soe Oo \u2014 including the rolled-up papers, as well as files and phone numbers captured from their cellphones and homes \u2014 were already public at the time of their arrest, and that having phone numbers was part of their job.\nThe judge, U Ye Lwin, ruled that the journalists intended to harm the country by sharing its secrets.\n\u201cIt cannot be said that they were doing normal journalistic work,\u201d he said in announcing the verdict. \u201cAnd the top-secret documents they were holding can be useful to the enemies of the country or the ones who oppose the country.\u201d\nThe judge\u2019s verdict and harsh sentence outraged rights activists and dealt another blow to the legacy of Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel Peace laureate who heads the civilian government, as a former symbol of the fight for democracy and human rights.\nIt was her government that pursued the charges against the two journalists, despite her own history of serving 15 years under house arrest at the hands of an earlier military government in Myanmar, then known as Burma.\n\u201cIt\u2019s deeply troubling for everybody who has struggled so hard here for media freedom,\u201d said Scot Marciel, the United States ambassador to Myanmar, who attended the court hearing.\nMr. Wa Lone, 32, and Mr. Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, were targeted by the police while they were investigating a massacre of 10 Rohingya Muslim villagers in Rakhine State.\nThe massacre took place a year ago, during a broader wave of arson, rape and killing by soldiers that drove more than 700,000 Rohingya into neighboring Bangladesh, in what has been widely condemned as ethnic cleansing. The Rohingya have lived in Myanmar for generations, but many Burmese consider them to be illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.\nThe two journalists found evidence that members of the military and Buddhist civilians killed 10 Rohingya males in the village of Inn Din. Their report, with photographs of the victims tied up and kneeling before their executions, and evidence of the mass grave where they were buried, was published after the reporters\u2019 arrest.\nDespite pressure from the international community, including recent sanctions by the United States against some of Myanmar\u2019s top generals, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi has refused to criticize the military campaign against the Rohingya.\nWestern governments, human rights groups and press freedom organizations around the world had urged Myanmar to free the Reuters journalists as a sign of commitment to the establishment of democracy and freedom of expression.\nOn Monday, the small courtroom was packed with family members, journalists, rights advocates and foreign diplomats.\n\u201cThe decision is very disappointing,\u201d said one of the reporters\u2019 lawyers, Khin Maung Zaw, after the hearing. \u201cThis is bad for the rule of law, bad for freedom of expression. This decision is against democracy.\u201d\nThe Reuters president and editor in chief, Stephen J. Adler, called the verdict an \u201cinjustice\u201d and urged Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s government to step in and free them.\n\u201cThese two admirable reporters have already spent nearly nine months in prison on false charges designed to silence their reporting and intimidate the press,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout any evidence of wrongdoing and in the face of compelling evidence of a police setup, today\u2019s ruling condemns them to the continued loss of their freedom and condones the misconduct of security forces.\u201d\nMr. Wa Lone and Mr. Kyaw Soe Oo, who have repeatedly denounced the authorities\u2019 actions, said after the hearing that they were disappointed by the verdict and the prison sentence, and insisted again that they had done nothing wrong.\nAt trial, the defense argued that it was a clear case of entrapment by the police, and that none of the prosecution\u2019s 17 witnesses had produced evidence of a crime.\nOne prosecution witness who said he was present during the arrests admitted under cross-examination that he had written the location on his hand so he would not forget it while he was testifying.\nAn officer admitted that he burned his notes of the arrest. Yet another police witness acknowledged that the information in the supposedly secret documents had been published in newspaper reports before the arrests.\nA police captain who told the court in April that the arrests had been a setup was punished for his testimony with a year in prison. \u201cI am revealing the truth, because police of any rank must maintain their own integrity,\u201d the captain, Moe Yan Naing told reporters after he testified. \u201cIt is true that they were set up.\u201d\nIn his ruling, Judge Ye Lwin rejected the defense arguments and found that the journalists illegally possessed confidential documents. He said that the reporters had been consistently trying to obtain government secrets and share them, which could be useful to enemies of the state.\nIn addition, the judge said that phone numbers they possessed, such as the number of a contact with the rebel Arakan Army, was further evidence of their intention to undermine the government.\nFor many journalists, finding secrets and making them public is the essence of the job.\n\u201cThis decision is made politically, not because they did something wrong,\u201d said Myint Kyaw, a member of the independent Myanmar Press Council. \u201cThis decision is a warning that no journalist can report freely about the Rakhine issue.\u201d\nDiplomats and rights advocates were outspoken in their criticism of the verdict.\nSean Bain, legal adviser in Yangon for the International Commission of Jurists, said the trial was \u201cgrossly unfair\u201d and that punishing journalists for exposing human rights violations undermines the rule of law.\n\u201cThe outrageous convictions of the Reuters journalists show Myanmar courts\u2019 willingness to muzzle those reporting on military atrocities,\u201d said Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. \u201cThese sentences mark a new low for press freedom and further backsliding on rights under Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s government.\u201d", "date": "Sept. 3, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/03/world/asia/myanmar-reuters-journalists-sentenced-trial.html", "tags": "myanmar sentences reporters rights \u201d reuters prison two years police journalists rohingya"}
