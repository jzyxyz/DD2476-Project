{"title": "Ties Fraying, Obama Drops Putin Meeting", "content": "President Obama on Wednesday canceled next month\u2019s Moscow summit meeting, ending for now his signature effort to transform Russian-American relations and potentially dooming his aspirations for further nuclear arms cuts before leaving office.\nFour years after declaring a new era between the two former cold war adversaries and after some early successes in forging fresh cooperation, Mr. Obama concluded that the two sides had grown so far apart again that there was no longer any point in sitting down with President Vladimir V. Putin. It was the first time an American leader had called off such a trip in decades.\nThe immediate cause was Russia\u2019s decision to grant temporary asylum to Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor who disclosed secret American surveillance programs. But like many broken marriages, the divorce was a long time coming. The two sides have been at loggerheads over arms control, missile defense, Syria, trade and human rights, and Obama aides said Moscow was no longer even responding to their proposals. And the president has privately expressed exasperation at the way Mr. Putin has dealt with him.\nThe cancellation of the Moscow meeting was not a complete break in relations. Mr. Obama will still attend the annual conference of the Group of 20 nations in St. Petersburg on Sept. 5 and 6, and his secretaries of state and defense will still meet with their Russian counterparts in Washington on Friday. But Mr. Obama will not even meet with Mr. Putin on the sidelines of the G-20 gathering, as is customary.\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t going to have a summit for the sake of appearances, and there wasn\u2019t an agenda that was ripe,\u201d said Benjamin J. Rhodes, the president\u2019s deputy national security adviser. \n\u201cWe\u2019re not in any way signaling that we want to cut off this relationship,\u201d he added, but meetings from now on will be held at lower levels. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to calibrate whether or not the relationship improves to the point where we can reopen the prospect of a presidential initiative.\u201d\nRussian officials blamed Mr. Obama for the deadlock and suggested he was motivated by domestic politics. Yuri V. Ushakov, an adviser to Mr. Putin, faulted the United States, saying it did not want to build stronger ties between the two countries. \n\u201cThis very problem underlines the fact that the United States is still not ready to build relations on an equal basis,\u201d he told reporters after Ambassador Michael McFaul delivered news of Mr. Obama\u2019s decision in Moscow.\nAleksei K. Pushkov, chairman of the Russian Parliament\u2019s foreign affairs committee, said the move heralded the end of the Obama administration\u2019s \u201creset\u201d policy. \u201cThe bilateral relationship has come to an impasse,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cIt makes it all the more necessary for the two presidents to meet and to try to work out a new agenda for the relations.\u201d\nThe White House had already planned to review the relationship after the September meeting to decide whether it was still worth as much of Mr. Obama\u2019s limited time and political resources. The cancellation made clear that the White House decided it was not, a calculation crystallized when American officials learned of Russia\u2019s asylum decision in Mr. Snowden\u2019s case at the same time the news media did.\n\u201cSnowden was obviously a factor, but this decision was rooted in a much broader assessment and deeper disappointment,\u201d said an administration official who was not authorized to be identified. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t get traction with the Russians. They were not prepared to engage seriously or immediately on what we thought was the very important agenda before us.\u201d\nAndrew C. Kuchins, director of Russia studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the administration would leave the ball in Mr. Putin\u2019s court. \u201cAt some point you\u2019ve just got to make the judgment that it\u2019s not working, it\u2019s not going anywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we let him hang in the breeze for a while?\u201d\nMr. Obama came to office in 2009 vowing to rebuild ties after years of tension. Working with Mr. Putin\u2019s successor, Dmitri A. Medvedev, Mr. Obama signed the New Start treaty slashing nuclear arsenals, established a critical supply corridor for troops in Afghanistan, helped Russia finally join the World Trade Organization and agreed on sanctions on Iran.\nBut Mr. Putin\u2019s return to power last year signaled a return of hostility. The Kremlin threw out American aid and democracy organizations, cracked down on internal opposition and backed President Bashar al-Assad in Syria\u2019s civil war. Mr. Putin skipped a Group of 8 summit meeting hosted by Mr. Obama at Camp David last year.\nFor his part, Mr. Obama did not attend an Asia-Pacific meeting hosted by Mr. Putin last fall, although it was during his re-election campaign and he had never planned to go. Congress passed the Magnitsky Act imposing sanctions against Russian human rights violations and Moscow retaliated by cutting off American adoptions of Russian children.\nMr. Obama reached out recently to no avail. He sent his national security adviser to Moscow in April with a plan to share missile defense data and made a speech in Berlin in June proposing further nuclear arms reductions. But officials said Russia had offered no substantive response. The Kremlin\u2019s handling of Mr. Snowden, one official said, was \u201cthe most provocative cold war manner of the choices that they had available to them.\u201d\nAndrei A. Piontovsky, a political analyst, said the cancellation underscored a visceral personal enmity between the two leaders. \u201cPutin openly despises your president, forgive my bluntness,\u201d he said.\nHe added that Russia sensed weakness in Mr. Obama that could lead to more dangerous confrontations.\n\u201cThe fact is the relations were completely broken for a very long time,\u201d he said. \u201cThe main raison d\u2019\u00eatre of Putin\u2019s policy now is to make an enemy of the United States.\u201d\nThe lack of prospect for agreement in Moscow in September was reinforced Monday when Rose Gottemoeller, the under secretary of state for arms control, met with Sergei Ryabkov, the Russian deputy foreign minister, in Brussels. Aides said Mr. Obama decided that same day to cancel the summit meeting. By Tuesday night, he was venting his irritation with Mr. Putin on \u201cThe Tonight Show.\u201d\n\u201cThere have been times where they slip back into cold war thinking and a cold war mentality,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cAnd what I consistently say to them, what I say to President Putin, is that\u2019s the past and we\u2019ve got to think about the future, and there\u2019s no reason why we shouldn\u2019t be able to cooperate more effectively than we do.\u201d\nThe cancellation was accompanied by a decision by Mr. Obama to visit Sweden instead, and the president has also invited leaders of Russia\u2019s Baltic neighbors to visit the White House, both moves that the Kremlin may see as jabs.\nBut Secretary of State John Kerry and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel will go ahead with a planned meeting on Friday with Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, and Defense Minister Sergei K. Shoigu. Officials said the meeting would test whether relations could move forward now that they had been downgraded.\nArms control advocates urged the two sides to pursue further nuclear cuts anyway. \n\u201cWe cannot afford to be spending money on maintaining an arsenal of cold war dimensions,\u201d said Daryl G. Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association. \u201cNeither can Russia. Both countries have an interest in reducing these stockpiles.\u201d\nBut Mr. Obama\u2019s decision received support among both Republicans and Democrats. Strobe Talbott, deputy secretary of state under Bill Clinton and now president of the Brookings Institution, said a Moscow meeting \u201cwould have been more happy talk than was merited.\u201d\nDavid J. Kramer, a former Bush administration official and now president of Freedom House, said Mr. Obama\u2019s reset policy made important accomplishments.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s exhausted itself,\u201d he said. \u201cIt sort of reached a point where the administration lived up to Einstein\u2019s theory of insanity \u2014 they kept repeating the same thing over and over expecting different results.\u201d", "date": "Aug. 7, 2013", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/08/world/europe/obama-cancels-visit-to-putin-as-snowden-adds-to-tensions.html", "tags": "drops \u201c fraying meeting moscow obama ties russia putin"}
