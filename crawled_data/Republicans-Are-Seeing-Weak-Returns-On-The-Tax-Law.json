{"title": "Republicans Are Seeing Weak Returns On The Tax Law", "content": "Opinions of the Republican tax plan appear to have stalled out, new polling suggests, leaving the law neither an obvious millstone nor an unambiguous asset for the GOP heading into the 2018 midterms.\nThe law, which passed with historically bad numbers, saw rising approval\u00a0during the start of the year, with many polls showing the public about split in its views. Republicans had hoped the law would boost their chances in November. \nIn a new HuffPost/YouGov survey,\u00a034 percent of Americans favor the law and 36 percent oppose it, for a net -2 rating.\nAs before, opinions remain strongly politicized: Just 7 percent of voters who backed Hillary Clinton in last year\u2019s election favor the tax bill, while only 6 percent of President Donald Trump\u2019s voters oppose it.\nAbout one-quarter of Americans say they\u2019ve seen an increase in their paycheck as a result of the law, but just 4 percent that they consider the increase to be a substantial one. Experts have said a far greater share would benefit from the new law\u2019s lower income tax rates, though the amounts may be so small that they\u2019re obscured by changes in pay or health insurance costs. By now, most people should have seen the changes reflected in their paychecks. \nNearly two-thirds of households will directly benefit from the individual income tax cuts this year, according to a new analysis the independent Tax Policy Center released this week. Only 27 percent of households in the bottom fifth of the income distribution will see an increase in after-tax income, while nearly all the taxpayers in the 95th to 99th percentiles will get a cut, reaping a larger benefit from the law than other income groups.\nRepublicans have portrayed the law as a windfall for working people, citing announcements from hundreds of companies that as many as 4 million workers would receive bonuses as a result of the law. (That\u2019s about 2.4 percent of the U.S. labor force.) \nThe law\u2019s core provision cut corporate taxes, which Republicans said would eventually boost wages by allowing firms to make capital investments that would increase worker productivity. In addition to worker bonuses, firms have also announced a wave of stock buybacks, which inflate share prices and tend to benefit executives.\nSeveral other surveys released in the latter half of March also suggest that the law\u2019s popularity has either dipped or stagnated. Economist/YouGov polling, which put net support for the law as high as +4 percent in February, last pegged it at -6. Quinnipiac\u2019s surveys, which have put the bill\u2019s backing between -8 and -14 since February, currently show it at a -9. And a recent CNBC poll also found that relatively few workers were reporting a positive effect on their paychecks.\nAmericans, regardless of their opinions of the plan, remain more likely to say they are influenced by the law\u2019s consequences for the country, rather than its effects on them personally, according to the HuffPost/YouGov survey. Of those who favor the law, 77 percent credit their support to a belief that its passage will benefit the country, while just one-quarter cite its benefit to them (respondents could choose both or neither options). Of those who oppose the law, 83 percent say it\u2019s because of its effect on the country, and just 29 percent that it\u2019s because of the law\u2019s effect on them.\nThe share of Americans who report having recently seen stories about other workers receiving benefits \u2015 51 percent \u2015 remains similar to the 55 percent who said that last month. But after a flurry of announcements at the beginning of the year, news about bonuses has seemingly dissipated. A news database search for stories in major newspapers that mentioned \u201ctax reform\u201d and \u201cbonuses\u201d turned up 169 articles in January, 82 in February and just 29 so far in March. \nIn a Pennsylvania special election earlier this month, Republicans all but abandoned the tax law in their talking points, apparently because it wasn\u2019t helping. Democrat Conor Lamb ultimately won a shocking upset in a district Trump had carried easily in 2016. \nUse the widget below to further explore the results of the HuffPost/YouGov survey, using the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups:\nThe HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted March 22-25 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov\u2019s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.\nHuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.\u00a0You can learn more\u00a0about this project and\u00a0take part\u00a0in YouGov\u2019s nationally representative opinion polling. More details on the polls\u2019 methodology are available\u00a0here.\nMost surveys report a margin of error that represents some, but not all, potential survey errors. YouGov\u2019s reports include a model-based margin of error, which rests on a specific set of statistical assumptions about the selected sample rather than the standard methodology for random probability sampling. If these assumptions are wrong, the model-based margin of error may also be inaccurate.\u00a0Click here\u00a0for a more detailed explanation of the model-based margin of error.", "date": "\n03/30/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/republican-tax-law-weak-returns_n_5abe8315e4b0a47437aaceac", "tags": "percent tax income seeing returns survey benefit year republicans new weak law"}
