{"title": "Harry and Meghan\u2019s New Titles are Duke and Duchess of Sussex", "content": "Just hours ahead of the royal wedding, the Palace has announced Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u2019s official titles. Upon being wed, they will be the Duke of and Duchess of Sussex.\nA duke is the highest ranking member of the English nobility, or peerage. Dukes outrank marquesses. (And marquesses outrank earls, who outrank viscounts, who outrank relatively lowly barons.)\nHarry\u2019s dukedom comes with two subsidiary titles: He is also Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel.\nThere has only been one previous Duke of Sussex: Prince Augustus Frederick, the sixth son of King George III and uncle of Queen Victoria, who was given the title in 1801. He was not a favorite of the court, given his progressive political views, which included his support for the abolition of the slave trade and his disregard for the legal restrictions placed on Jews.\nPrince Augustus was wed twice, but both times were in violation of the 1772 Royal Marriages Act, so neither marriage was recognized. The first was annulled and the couple's two children were considered illegitimate. (His second wife met with slightly more favor; Queen Victoria made her Duchess of Inverness). \nBut neither of August\u2019s wives was able to use the official title. Meghan Markle will be the first to officially be called Her Royal Highness, the Duchess of Sussex.", "date": "May 19, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/19/style/-duke-duchess-sussex-meghan-harry.html", "tags": "meghan duchess markle outrank royal official duke sussex prince new harry titles"}
