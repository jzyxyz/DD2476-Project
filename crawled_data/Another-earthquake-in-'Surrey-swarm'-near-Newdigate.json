Another small felt earthquake in Surrey this morning recorded on our two new seismic monitoring stations just a few km away.\"\nHe said he also recorded the tremor using equipment in his living room, 20 miles away.\nDr Hicks told BBC Surrey the magnitude of the latest tremor was \"at the lower end of the sequence that we've had so far\".\n\"It shows this swam of earthquakes is continuing and will be closely monitored now we have the new stations.\n\"I don't think we're going to see any large earthquakes in this region, but they might continue to be felt as the sequence continues,\" he said.\nSurrey's earthquake swarm", "date": "18 July 2018", "href": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-44870982", "tags": "near surrey earthquake stations tremor latest another felt new tremors newdigate swarm"}
