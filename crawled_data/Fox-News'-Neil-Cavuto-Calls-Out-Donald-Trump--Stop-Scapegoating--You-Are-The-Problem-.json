{"title": "Fox News' Neil Cavuto Calls Out Donald Trump- Stop Scapegoating- You Are The Problem-", "content": "Fox News host Neil Cavuto devoted a segment on his Tuesday show to giving some \u201ccommon sense\u201d advice to President Donald Trump.\nFollowing days of Twitter outbursts about \u201cfake news\u201d and London Mayor Sadiq Khan\u2019s handling of the weekend\u2019s deadly terrorist attack, Cavuto spoke directly to Trump. \u201cMr. President, it is not the fake news media that\u2019s your problem. It\u2019s you,\u201d he said.\nThe host continued to call out the president for \u201cscapegoating,\u201d \u201cfeeding [his own] beast,\u201d and \u201cacting beastly with [his] own guys.\u201d Cavuto criticized Trump for alienating members of his own party and creating the very distractions he blames for derailing his presidential agenda. He then urged the president to listen to his once-friendly allies.\n\u201cUse these critiques you\u2019re now hearing from usually friendly and supportive allies as sort of like an intervention,\u201d Cavuto suggested. \u201cBecause firing off these angry missives and tweets risk your political destruction.\u201d\nTrump has emerged on the international scene with skepticism toward longstanding U.S. diplomatic relationships. In a matter of weeks, the president has\u00a0refused\u00a0to reaffirm his commitment to aiding NATO allies under attack, withdrawn\u00a0the U.S. from the landmark Paris Agreement\u00a0and made rash comments about London\u2019s mayor and Qatar \u2015 moves that have all been met with backlash.\nCavuto summed up his comments by telling the president that his critics are not the issue. \u201cThey\u2019re not the problem, Mr. President,\u201d he said. \u201cLike I said, these days, you are.\u201d\nWatch the full segment in the video above.", "date": "\n06/07/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/fox-news-neil-cavuto-host-calls-out-trump-you-are-the-problem_n_593791b2e4b0ce1e7408e7f6", "tags": "allies calls fox news segment host \u201d donald stop cavuto scapegoating- problem- neil trump-"}
