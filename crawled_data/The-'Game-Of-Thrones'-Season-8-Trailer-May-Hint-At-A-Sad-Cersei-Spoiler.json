{"title": "The 'Game Of Thrones' Season 8 Trailer May Hint At A Sad Cersei Spoiler", "content": "We have no problem raising a glass to the\u00a0Season 8 trailer\u00a0of \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d But when Cersei pours herself a goblet, there\u2019s reason to worry.\nAmong the many shots in the new trailer is a sequence featuring Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey), in which she seems tearful while sipping on some wine. We know it\u2019s wine because the official \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d Twitter account retweeted this GIF confirming her drink of choice:\nAnd that\u2019s great. Who doesn\u2019t want to cheer the final season of \u201cThrones\u201d with a nice glass of vino? But a previous Season 7 scene makes this all a bit more troubling.\nIn the Season 7 finale, Tyrion (Peter Dinklage) and Cersei are talking privately when he offers her a glass of wine. Despite her love of the stuff (and fan compilations proving that point over and over again), the drink goes untouched. Cersei eventually puts her hand on her stomach and Tyrion guesses she\u2019s pregnant.\nNow, sure, prenatal care \u2015 including warnings about the effects of alcohol on unborn babies \u2015 probably wasn\u2019t the most advanced during the heyday of Westeros. And with White Walkers on the way, a bit of light drinking while pregnant isn\u2019t a top worry here. But Cersei abstaining from wine in the Season 7 scene plays as a clear hint to her pregnancy, as some on Reddit also point out, and seems to aid Tyrion\u2019s guess that she\u2019s with child.\nSo showing a scene in the trailer of Cersei drinking wine while tears well up in her eyes could be read as a sign that she\u2019s not pregnant anymore, possibly having lost her baby.\nNow, nothing is certain until the season finally airs. For all fans know, Cersei may have already had the baby. (Her hair does look a little longer, so maybe there\u2019s a little Lannister just out of the shot?)\nIn addition to the supposed plot leak, however, there is also the\u00a0prophecy that Cersei would have only three children, all of whom were fathered by her twin brother, Jaime Lannister (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau), and have died during the show\u2019s run.\u00a0\n\u201cYou will have three,\u201d a witch tells Cersei in a Season 5 flashback scene. \u201cGold will be their crowns, gold their shrouds.\u201d\nHuffPost asked Coster-Waldau\u00a0about this prophecy, if there was some trickery with Cersei\u2019s latest pregnancy, or if Euron Greyjoy (Pilou Asb\u00e6k) was really the father. The actor didn\u2019t give up much.\n\u201cHow depressing!\u201d he laughed, adding, \u201cBut, no, I can\u2019t say anything.\u201d\nProphecy aside, if Cersei does lose her baby, it could also make Gendry (Joe Dempsie) all the more important. His character is widely theorized to be the \u201cblack-haired\u201d child Cersei reveals she lost to a fever in Season 1:\nThat would make him the legitimate child of Cersei and Robert Baratheon (Mark Addy), aka the heir to the Iron Throne.\u00a0Plus,\u00a0Gendry doesn\u2019t remember\u00a0much about his mother, except that she had \u201cyellow hair,\u201d you know, kind of like Cersei.\nDempsie himself is into the theory, thinking it could blow \u201cso much out of the water.\u201d Though Coster-Waldau later told us, \u201cI think Joe just wanted to get on the throne and that\u2019s why he\u2019s putting it out there.\u201d\nMaybe the shot of Cersei boozing it up during King\u2019s Landing Wine and Cheese Night doesn\u2019t mean anything. Maybe the scene is just trolling those fans (and entertainment writers)\u00a0who are speculating on every little detail. Or maybe this is just one of the reasons everyone\u2019s been looking so depressed in all the Season 8 photos.\nAll we know is that before her pregnancy, Cersei really loved her wine.", "date": "\n03/05/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/game-of-thrones-trailer-cersei-spoiler_n_5c7e9c67e4b0e62f69e6ca85", "tags": "glass cersei may maybe wine know scene season hint trailer sad \u201d thrones spoiler"}
