{"title": "Synagogue Shooting Highlights History Of Hate In Pittsburgh", "content": "PITTSBURGH \u2014 Just over two months before a white supremacist gunman massacred 11 worshippers\u00a0in the Tree of Life synagogue, the city of Pittsburgh was home to another deadly crime many say was motivated by hate. \nIn August a 24-year-old white man named Jordan Rocco posted a video to Instagram in which he described how he was going to play a game: He was going to see how many times he could say \u201cn****r\u201d before getting kicked out of bars. A few hours later, he was denied entry to the Little Red Corvette bar on Pittsburgh\u2019s popular North Shore. Unprovoked, he then allegedly attacked two black men on the sidewalk, fatally stabbing 24-year-old Dulane Cameron Jr. \nAmong the many white supremacist posts later discovered on Rocco\u2019s Facebook page was this: \u201cWhat do blacks offer society. All they do is ruin western civilization.\u201d\nThe blood that gushed from Cameron\u2019s neck that night in August no longer stains the sidewalk on North Shore Drive. On Monday evening, people walked into the bars to watch \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d or stumbled out for a smoke. There\u2019s no memorial to mark his killing.\nBut Dulane Cameron\u2019s mother, Stephanie Cameron, will never forget what happened there. \u201cI think about my son every day,\u201d she told HuffPost. \u201cIt\u2019s hard. The only thing that gets me through it is praying.\u201d \nIt has been especially hard since Saturday, watching the news of another hate crime in her city. Stephanie Cameron, 47, has two other children, ages 11 and 13, both of whom are in grief counseling over their big brother\u2019s death. \u201cSome people, they don\u2019t know the hurt and pain they\u2019re causing, the suffering they\u2019re causing,\u201d she said she explained to her children after the Tree of Life mass shooting. \u201cSome people might not be in their right mind.\u201d\nThe killings at Tree of Life synagogue have brought the Pittsburgh area\u2019s other hate crimes and hate incidents over the last few years into sharp focus. \nIn July eight members of a neo-Nazi gang \u2014 Keystone United, formerly known as the Keystone State Skinheads \u2014 allegedly\u00a0assaulted a black man\u00a0at a bar in Avalon, six miles outside the city. Witnesses said the gang members called the victim, Paul Morris, \u201cnigger\u201d multiple times before beating him. Morris told KDKA-TV\u00a0that the gang members told him before the beating that they wanted to eradicate black people. \nSomeone wrote \u201cKill Niger Tomlin\u201d on a city bench, referring to Pittsburgh Steelers coach Mike Tomlin, who is black; someone wrote \u201cKill the Jews\u201d in pinecones on a sidewalk in Mount Lebanon;\u00a0 vandals trashed boats at a marina in Plum, writing \u201cHitler was right\u201d on one of the boat\u2019s walls; and in Avondale, someone put a neo-Nazi sticker on a gas station pump, according to a tip submitted to the Documenting Hate project, a database maintained by ProPublica in partnership with HuffPost and other news outlets.\u00a0\nIn November 2016, a couple of weeks after the presidential election, a 54-year-old white man named Jeffrey Burgess attacked a man of Indian descent\u00a0in a Red Robin restaurant in South Hills. Burgess repeatedly called the man a \u201cfucking Muslim,\u201d and said \u201cI don\u2019t want you sitting next to me ... you people,\u201d according to witnesses. At one point Burgess said, \u201cThings are different now,\u201d a reference, authorities said, to the election of Donald Trump. \nThe day after that assault, members of the First Unitarian Church in Shadyside arrived at the church to find their \u201cBlack lives matter\u201d sign had been vandalized\u00a0to read, \u201cBlue lives matter more.\u201d\u00a0\nAnd in 2015 a white man hurled a black man onto a subway track in downtown Pittsburgh, then beat him unconscious while calling him a \u201cnigger.\u201d\nOn Sunday a local anti-fascist activist in his early 30s, who asked not to be identified, dropped off flowers at the Tree of Life synagogue. \u201cThis is not the first time a synagogue has been targeted in Pittsburgh,\u201d he told HuffPost. \nHe recounted the story of a white man named Richard Baumhammers, who on April 28, 2000, went on a rampage in the Pittsburgh area,\u00a0targeting minorities. Five people were killed and one other person badly injured. Among the victims were a native of India working at a grocery store, two Asian-Americans working at a Chinese restaurant, a black man taking a karate class and a Jewish woman who was Baumhammers\u2019 neighbor. During his attack, he fired bullets at two synagogues, taking the time to vandalize one with a swastika and the word \u201cJew.\u201d\nThe anti-fascist activist told HuffPost he\u2019s worried there could be more people like Baumhammers and Richard Bowers \u2014 the white supremacist accused of the massacre at Tree of Life \u2014 lurking in Pittsburgh and elsewhere in the country, especially as white supremacists have been emboldened by Trump\u2019s racist and anti-immigrant rhetoric. \nIt\u2019s hard to discern whether hate crimes are on the rise in Pittsburgh. The Pittsburgh Police Department recorded only 14 hate crimes in 2016 and the same number in 2015, according to data it sent to the FBI. But most hate crimes in America\u00a0go unreported to police. And the crimes that do get reported often aren\u2019t recorded as hate crimes or aren\u2019t prosecuted as such. (Pennsylvania is particularly bad at recording and prosecuting hate crimes. Prosecutors in Pittsburgh have not yet charged Rocco with a hate crime for Dulane Cameron\u2019s killing.)\nSafdar Khwaja, the president of the Pittsburgh chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, is worried that hate is on the rise across the country large part because of the president\u2019s rhetoric. \u201cThis strain of white nationalism is becoming really rampant, and people are making excuses for it, and people are deflecting it,\u201d he told HuffPost. \nIt\u2019s personal for Khwaja. He lost a friend, Jerry Rabinowitz, in the shooting at Tree of Life. They had been part of the same Muslim-Jewish dialogue group for the past 15 years. \nThere are temporary Star of David\u2013shaped memorials for Rabinowitz and the 10 other victims outside the Tree of Life synagogue. On Monday night, scores of people showed up to pray and lay flowers.\nOne woman, 68-year-old Risha Saberstein, arrived from Baltimore to pay her respects. She sat in a wheelchair and offered kosher pastries to her fellow mourners. She held a Torah on her lap, occasionally flipping through its pages. \n\u201cGod gives, and God takes away,\u201d she summarized one passage in the holy book. Staring at the flowers outside the synagogue, she said it felt as though God had \u201cforsaken us.\u201d \nStephanie Cameron is also deeply religious. \n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to get worse,\u201d she said, adding that it\u2019s as if we\u2019re nearing \u201cthe end days, because God says in his word that we will know by his signs, by what\u2019s happening.\u201d \nYet, asked what she would tell the grieving families of those killed at Tree of Life, Cameron offered a message of hope. \u00a0\n\u201cI would say keep the faith,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t lose heart. Pray. That\u2019s what I would say.\u201d\nRowaida Abdelaziz and Andy Campbell contributed reporting.\u00a0\nCORRECTION:\u00a0A previous version of this story misstated the location of the the killing of Dulane Cameron Jr. as North Shore Drive. It occurred on Pittsburgh\u2019s North Shore.\nAmerica does not do a good job of tracking incidents of hate and bias. We need your help to create a database of such incidents across the country, so we all know what\u2019s going on.\u00a0Tell us your story.", "date": "\n10/30/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/tree-of-life-pittsburgh-hate-crimes-dulane-cameron_n_5bd86fcfe4b0dee6eece4017", "tags": "shooting history hate pittsburgh cameron tree man highlights \u201d white synagogue life"}
