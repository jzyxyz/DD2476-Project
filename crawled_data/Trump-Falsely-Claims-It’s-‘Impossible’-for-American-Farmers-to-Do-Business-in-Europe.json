(Overall, the United States has had an agricultural trade surplus with the rest of the world since 1960.) \nThe European Union does impose a higher average tariff on agricultural products (11 to 12 percent) than the United States (about 5 percent), but about a third of farm goods enter both the European Union and the United States tariff-free, according to the World Trade Organization.\n\u201cTwo-way U.S.-E.U. trade has been roughly balanced over time and the very high levels of foreign investment accounted for by each in the other\u2019s markets means that the trans-Atlantic economy is arguably the most integrated on earth,\u201d the website of the Office of the United States Trade Representative reads. \nMr. Trump also, again, exaggerated the overall trade deficit with the European Union by $50 billion; it is $101 billion. His statement about the United States \u201cnicely\u201d paying for the defense of European countries through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is also misleading. \nSources: Department of Agriculture, Office of the United States Trade Representative, World Trade Organization, The New York Times", "date": "July 10, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/10/us/politics/trump-fact-check-european-union-agriculture.html", "tags": "american european \u2018 farmers billion business united claims states union \u201d trump europe trade products falsely agricultural impossible"}
