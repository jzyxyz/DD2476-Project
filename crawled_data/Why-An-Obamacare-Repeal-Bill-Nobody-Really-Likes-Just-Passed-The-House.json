{"title": "Why An Obamacare Repeal Bill Nobody Really Likes Just Passed The House", "content": "The American Health Care Act has passed the House of Representatives, as you may have heard, and that means Republicans are one very big step closer to repealing Obamacare.\nBut here\u2019s the strange thing: Almost nobody seems to like the legislation very much, and that includes many if not most of the 217 House Republicans who said \u201caye\u201d to it Thursday.\n\u201cThe amazing thing is, I really don\u2019t think Republicans writ large believe in what they just passed,\u201d\u00a0HuffPost congressional reporter Matt Fuller says in a new episode of the \u201cCandidate Confessional\u201d podcast.\nOf course, that hasn\u2019t prevented House Republicans and their allies, including President Donald Trump, from promising that the bill would deliver lower premiums and out-of-pocket costs without harming people who have pre-existing conditions or anybody else who now depends on the Affordable Care Act for coverage.\nSo are their claims about the law true? Why were Republicans so determined to pass it when so few of them were enthusiastic about it? What did they do to get it through the House, after the bill seemed dead?\u00a0\nAnd what happens now that it\u2019s the Senate\u2019s turn?\nIn this special, off-season episode of \u201cCandidate Confessional,\u201d Fuller joins senior politics editor Sam Stein, along with policy writers Jeffrey Young and\u00a0Jonathan Cohn, to answer these questions.", "date": "\n05/05/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/house-republicans-health-care-bill-candidate-confessional_n_590d01f4e4b0e7021e97e93e", "tags": "really obamacare nobody passed repeal episode likes republicans \u201d house thing act bill fuller care"}
