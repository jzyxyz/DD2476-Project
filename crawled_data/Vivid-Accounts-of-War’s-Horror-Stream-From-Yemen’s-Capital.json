{"title": "Vivid Accounts of War\u2019s Horror Stream From Yemen\u2019s Capital", "content": "Residents of Yemen\u2019s capital, Sana, shared vivid accounts of life during wartime on social networks on Monday, as a huge blast shattered windows and shook buildings miles from the site of an attack in the Faj Attan district of the city.\nDozens of people were feared dead after the airstrike by a Saudi-led military coalition set off a huge explosion that flattened homes in the neighborhood, witnesses said.\nStrikingly clear images of the blast were captured in a video clip widely shared from phone to phone using the WhatsApp messaging service. The latter portion of that clip also gave a sense of the powerful shock wave that shattered glass around the capital.\nCivilians in Sana, who have been sharing close-up views of the city under bombardment for nearly four weeks, documented another day of feeling terrorized in Twitter dispatches. Some added the tag #KefayaWar to their updates, using the Arabic word for \u201cenough\u201d to express their anger and frustration with the fighting.\nLater Monday, Twitter users in the capital warned that the attacks on weapons stockpiles in the Faj Attan district might continue, and Yemenis abroad shared desperate pleas from relatives stranded in the city.", "date": "April 20, 2015", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/21/world/middleeast/vivid-accounts-of-wars-horror-stream-from-yemens-capital.html", "tags": "vivid blast accounts horror city monday faj sana yemen war capital attan stream shattered huge shared"}
