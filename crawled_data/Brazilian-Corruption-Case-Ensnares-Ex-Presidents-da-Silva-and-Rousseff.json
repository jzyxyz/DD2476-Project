{"title": "Brazilian Corruption Case Ensnares Ex-Presidents da Silva and Rousseff", "content": "S\u00c3O PAULO, Brazil \u2014 Brazil\u2019s attorney general on Tuesday charged former President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva; his successor, Dilma Rousseff; and several other senior figures of the Workers\u2019 Party with running a \u201ccriminal organization\u201d that raked in hundreds of millions in bribes during the party\u2019s nearly 14-year reign.\nThe case is the first in which Ms. Rousseff, who was impeached last year for violating budgetary rules, stands accused of partaking in the kickback schemes that have cast a pall over every major Brazilian political party.\nThe charges were unveiled the same day that Mr. da Silva wrapped up a 25-city campaign trip through his party\u2019s strongholds in the northeast, during which he sought to play down a recent corruption conviction that may doom his ambition to return to the presidency.\nThe attorney general, Rodrigo Janot, whose term ends this month, described the governments of Mr. da Silva and Ms. Rousseff as essentially fronts for a criminal enterprise through which senior politicians collected roughly $450 million from entities that included the state-run oil company Petrobras and the Brazilian National Development Bank. In addition to his conviction, Mr. da Silva has been charged in several other cases in which he stands accused of accepting bribes of relatively modest sums.\nBut the 230-page charge sheet released Tuesday puts him at the center of a huge conspiracy. Mr. Janot wrote that the allegations should not be seen as a sign that the judiciary was \u201ccriminalizing politics\u201d or routine \u201cpolitical negotiations,\u201d but rather as a record of a ruling elite that systematically used public money to \u201cbuy popular support.\u201d\nThe accusations against Ms. Rousseff, who has portrayed herself as a clean politician who was brought down by a cabal of corrupt rivals, is a startling development in the series of revelations that spun from a routine investigation of money laundering at a gas station in Bras\u00edlia, Brazil\u2019s capital, in 2014.\n\u201cThis is very significant,\u201d said Matthew M. Taylor, a professor at American University in Washington who studies Brazil\u2019s justice system. \u201cDilma had been arguing that she was personally honest.\u201d\nMr. Janot described Mr. da Silva as the mastermind of the kickback scheme, initially as president and later as a result of the \u201cstrong influence he exercised over\u201d Ms. Rousseff. The attorney general emphasized that many key players in the bribery scheme were supported or appointed by Ms. Rousseff.\n\u201cDilma Rousseff integrated the current criminal organization since 2003 when she accepted\u201d Mr. da Silva\u2019s invitation to run the Ministry of Mines and Energy, he wrote. \u201cFrom there, she contributed decisively so that the private interests negotiated in exchange for bribes could be met, especially in relation to Petrobras, where she was the president of the board between 2003 and 2010.\u201d\nMr. Janot, who was appointed by Ms. Rousseff in 2013, wrote that Mr. da Silva and Ms. Rousseff spread the wealth, inviting leaders of other political parties to take part in the scheme.\n\u201cCritics had long said that given her prominent roles on the Petrobras board, and as head of the M.M.E., Dilma was either complicit or incompetent,\u201d Mr. Taylor said. \u201cJanot clearly thinks the former.\u201d\nBut in a statement released Tuesday night, Ms. Rousseff\u2019s press office said, \u201cWithout presenting proof or evidence of a material crime, the attorney general\u2019s office is filing charges without any foundation whatsoever.\u201d\nAnd the Workers\u2019 Party, in its own statement, called the allegations baseless and the continuation of a vendetta by the judiciary to weaken certain political factions through \u201cselective persecution.\u201d\nThe case was filed as President Michel Temer, who stepped into the job after Ms. Rousseff\u2019s impeachment in August 2016, was himself bracing for a new set of corruption charges. Mr. Janot charged Mr. Temer with corruption in June over accusations that he authorized a bribe to keep an imprisoned politician silent. The president managed to avoid standing trial in that case by getting enough members of the lower house of Congress to block the case from reaching the Supreme Court \u2014 the only court where senior Brazilian elected officials may be tried.\nOne defendant in the latest case, Senator Gleisi Hoffmann, who took the helm of the Workers\u2019 Party in June, enjoys the same legal protection, which critics say has contributed to a culture of impunity among Brazilian politicians.\nIt was unclear whether the case caught the defendants by surprise. As Brazilians were poring through the charging document, Mr. da Silva was sounding triumphant at the end of his caravan tour.\n\u201cI\u2019ll say one thing: we\u2019re going to govern this country again,\u201d he said in a post on Twitter addressing his followers. \u201cAnd when I saw we, it\u2019s not me. It\u2019s you.\u201d\nAlso charged in the case were: Guido Mantega, a former finance minister; Paulo Bernardo, a former communications minister; Antonio Palocci Filho, a former chief of staff for Ms. Rousseff; Jo\u00e3o Vaccari Neto, a former treasurer for the Workers\u2019 Party; and Edinho Silva, the mayor of Araraquara.", "date": "Sept. 5, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/05/world/americas/brazil-dilma-rousseff-lula-corruption-workers-party.html", "tags": "rousseff janot da brazilian corruption party ensnares \u201d silva ms. case ex-presidents"}
