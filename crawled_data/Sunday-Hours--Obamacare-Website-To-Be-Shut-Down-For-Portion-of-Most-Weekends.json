{"title": "Sunday Hours- Obamacare Website To Be Shut Down For Portion of Most Weekends", "content": "The Trump administration plans to shut down the federal health insurance exchange for 12 hours during all but one Sunday in the upcoming open enrollment season.\nThe shutdown will occur from 12 a.m. to 12 p.m. ET on every Sunday except Dec. 10.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services will also shut down the federal exchange \u2014\u00a0healthcare.gov\u00a0\u2014 overnight on the first day of open enrollment, Nov. 1. More than three dozen states use that exchange for their marketplaces.\nHHS officials disclosed this information Friday during a webinar with community groups that help people enroll.\nThe Trump administration has come under attack from critics who say that it is intentionally undermining the Affordable Care Act, through regulatory actions. It\u00a0shortened the enrollment period, withdrew money for advertising and cut the budget for navigator groups, which help people shop for plans.\nAnd now HHS is closing the site for a substantial portion of each weekend \u2014 for maintenance, officials said. That is the same time that many working patients \u2014 the prime target group for ACA insurance \u2014 could be shopping for their insurance, critics noted.\n\u201cThe Department of Health & Human Services is actively trying to prevent people from signing up for healthcare coverage,\u201d Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) tweeted. \u201cThis is outrageous.\u201d\n\u201cArgh\u201d was the reaction of Shelli Quenga, program director at the Palmetto Project in South Carolina, a nonprofit group that received about $1 million to help with outreach and enrollment in the past 12 months. This month, HHS cut her budget in half for this year\u2019s open enrollment.\nOpen enrollment season will run from Nov. 1 to Dec. 15, less than half the time people have had to sign up during the first four years of the exchanges created under the Affordable Care Act.\nMore than 12 million people enrolled on the state and federal marketplaces for 2017 coverage, including more than 9 million on the federal exchange. Some customers give up coverage over the course of the year.\nAdvocates were already nervous that fewer people would sign up during the shortened period this time around.\n\u201cI could see this really impacting the ability of people to complete an application sign-up in a single sitting, which is so important,\u201d said Jason Stevenson, spokesman for the Utah Health Policy Project, an Obamacare navigator group. He noted that 10 p.m. Mountain Time is often a relatively popular time for people to enroll online.\n\u201cHealth insurance is complicated, and in the past couple of years we had an administration that made it easier to sign up, but that has really changed in the past six months, with more hurdles not only for consumers but for those whose job it is to help them,\u201d he said.\nA spokesman for the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which oversees the exchanges, said the shutdowns should not cause too many problems.\n\u201cMaintenance outages are regularly scheduled on healthcare.gov every year during open enrollment. This year is no different,\u201d said the official, speaking on background and requesting anonymity. \u201cThe maintenance schedule was provided in advance this year in order to accommodate requests from certified application assisters. System downtime is planned for the lowest-traffic time periods on healthcare.gov, including Sunday evenings and overnight.\u201d\nFormer Obama administration officials say the planned shutdowns of healthcare.gov goes far beyond what\u2019s happened before. Typically, the online enrollment system was offline for only a few hours at a time and it was much less frequent than once a week.\nA federal report to Congress said healthcare.gov was\u00a0online 99.9 percent of the time\u00a0in the 2015 and 2016 open enrollment seasons.\nThe Trump administration plan will have the site operating 93 percent of the time \u2014 over an enrollment period that is half as long as it used to be. In effect, instead of a 90-day enrollment season, the Trump administration cut it to 45. With the maintenance shutdowns, cut it to an equivalent of 42 days.\n\u201cThere is just a really big question as to why this is happening,\u201d said Lori Lodes, former CMS communications director. \u201cHave they done a comprehensive review of the tech and believe this is what is actually necessary? If so, then why don\u2019t they have confidence in the system.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never only had six weeks to do this with no outreach help from the Feds,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery minute is valuable.\u201d", "date": "\n09/23/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/sunday-hours-obamacare-website-to-be-shut-down-for-portion-of-most-weekends_n_59c5a20be4b0cdc773316974", "tags": "administration open sunday obamacare website hours- portion weekends shut \u201d said federal time \u2014 enrollment"}
