{"title": "Why That Daenerys Twist On 'Game Of Thrones' Burns So Badly", "content": "Spoilers ahead \u2014 beware if you\u2019re not caught up on \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d\nIn case you missed the hot takes and angry Twitter reactions, in the fifth episode of the final season of \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d everything burned to the ground, starting with Daenerys Targaryen\u2019s hero arc. (Sorry if you\u2019ve already named your baby Khaleesi.)\nThe Season 8 episode, titled \u201cThe Bells,\u201d shows Daenerys\u2019 army quickly taking over King\u2019s Landing, leaving the Lannister forces to surrender.\u00a0They ring the city bells to indicate they\u2019re throwing in the towel and it seems everything\u2019s finally going to end peacefully, with Dany (Emilia Clarke) succeeding in \u201cbreaking the wheel.\u201d The battle is over... until Dany realizes there\u2019s still 45 minutes left in the episode.\nSeemingly out of the blue, the Mother of Dragons snaps.\u00a0\nIgnoring the chimes, and all the innocents shouting \u201cring the bells\u201d over and over, Dany decides to go the route of her father, the Mad King Aerys II, and \u201cburn them all.\u201d She unleashes her last living dragon, Drogon, on the city and her army subsequently murders the rest of the Lannister forces.\nAnd everyone watching collectively went, \u201cWhat?\u201d\nFor eight seasons, Daenerys very much seemed to be all about breaking chains and saving those who suffer.\u00a0Considering that, having her commit genocide on a whim is a little hard to swallow.\nAlso, did the show just forget she was in the North fighting on the side of the living two episodes ago? She didn\u2019t have to do that. Dany could\u2019ve just taken King\u2019s Landing with her dragons and left the North to fight for itself. But the Mother of Dragons saw the undead beyond the Wall and knew the kingdom would suffer if she didn\u2019t do something.\u00a0\nWhat\u2019s going on here?\nOn HBO\u2019s \u201cInside the Episode,\u201d which takes a closer look at what happens each week, showrunner Dan Weiss said the moment Dany snapped wasn\u2019t premeditated. It was only after seeing the Red Keep, her family home which was taken away from her, that Dany \u201cmakes the decision to make this personal.\u201d\u00a0\nThat means to fully understand Dany\u2019s actions, the \u201cInside the Episode\u201d segments almost become required viewing.\u00a0(\u201cOh, so Dany was triggered after seeing the Red Keep because of 300 years of Targaryen history that wasn\u2019t really brought up? OK, got it.\u201d)\u00a0\u00a0\nSo it was a spur-of-the-moment decision for the character \u2014 but there were signs Dany might turn ahead of Sunday\u2019s episode.\u00a0Fellow showrunner David Benioff explained during \u201cInside the Episode\u201d that \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d had been planting hints at Dany\u2019s dark future since Season 1.\n\u201cThere is something kind of chilling about the way that Dany has responded to the death of her enemies,\u201d he said.\nAccording to Benioff, everything leading up to the moment at King\u2019s Landing \u2014 Jon revealing his parentage, Cersei betraying the North and the death of Missandei \u2014 had to occur in order for Dany\u2019s decision to happen.\n\u201cIf all these things had happened in any different way, then I don\u2019t think we\u2019d be seeing this side of Daenerys Targaryen,\u201d Benioff said.\nLikewise, Episode 4 director David Nutter told HuffPost last week that Missandei\u2019s (Nathalie Emmanuel) death \u201cserves the purpose to basically be the one thing to turn Dany into this \u2014 she\u2019s so angry after this.\u201d\nWhen you look back at the show as a whole, those signs of Daenerys breaking bad have been there throughout: Dany has a startling, removed reaction when her brother, Viserys (Harry Lloyd), has his head melted by Khal Drogo (Jason Momoa); she wasn\u2019t afraid to hop on a dragon and tell a mob to kill her enemies; and she roasted Randyll (James Faulkner) and Dickon Tarly (Tom Hopper) for refusing to bend the knee.\nWhile Meereen is under attack in Season 6, Episode 9, Daenerys tells Tyrion (Peter Dinklage), \u201cI will crucify the masters. I will set their fleets afire, kill every last one of their soldiers and return their cities to the dirt. That is my plan.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a big leap between saying you\u2019re going to have some enemy soldiers roasted and actually destroying an entire city, however.\nThe \u201cSong of Ice and Fire\u201d books that are the basis of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d make the case for evil Daenerys even more seamlessly.\u00a0\nIn George R.R. Martin\u2019s novels, Dany becomes worried about turning into her father, she gets increasingly wary of who she can trust and, quite blatantly, has a number of hallucinations in the final chapter of \u201cA Dance with Dragons\u201d about embracing her Targaryen instincts \u2014 it\u2019s very much the vibe of what Olenna Tyrell (Diana Rigg) tells Dany in Season 7: \u201cBe a dragon.\u201d\nIn one of the hallucinations, she believes she hears Jorah Mormont imploring her to reject the peace she tried to make in Meereen and embrace her \u201cblood of the dragon\u201d:\nEarly on in \u201cThe Bells,\u201d the foreshadowing in both the books and the show collide when, before Dany barbecues him, Varys (Conleth Hill) paraphrases a quote from Martin\u2019s novels about Targaryens having the potential to lose their minds.\nThe full quote comes from Barristan Selmy in\u00a0\u201cA Storm of Swords\u201d:\nThis melding of the books and show seems to signify that it\u2019s all heading in the same direction, with Dany becoming the big bad of the story.\u00a0The hints are nothing new. Dany taking after her father and turning into a \u201cMad Queen\u201d has thus far been one of the most popular theories of the series.\nThat all being said, in Season 7 Dany specifically states she doesn\u2019t want to be \u201cQueen of the Ashes.\u201d So this latest move to become the ash-hole of queens seems completely out of character for the Mother of Dragons... at least the one we know on the show, anyway.\nWith this being such a huge shift in the story, it\u2019s very possible that the Daenerys twist is something Martin has planned for his upcoming novels.\nSometime around 2013, showrunners Benioff and Weiss famously met with Martin to go over the beats for the end of the story. Benioff told Vanity Fair\u00a0in a 2014 interview that he and Weiss wanted to \u201clay the groundwork\u201d and \u201cset things up\u201d for the rest of the show.\u00a0Martin confirmed to the magazine that he gave \u201cthe broad strokes\u201d of the series, \u201cbut the details aren\u2019t there yet.\u201d\nAt that time, the author was still \u201chopeful\u201d the showrunners wouldn\u2019t catch up to the books. (Spoiler alert: They did.)\nAnd because Martin\u2019s remaining two books in the series still haven\u2019t arrived, since Season 5 on, \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d has been revealing some of those \u201cbroad strokes\u201d of what comes in Martin\u2019s novels but without all the background or context for how they\u2019ll occur in his story.\nThe Season 6 reveal of how Hodor\u00a0(Kristian Nairn) got his name, for example, is an event that is planned to happen in the books. In fact, the showrunners claimed it was one of three \u201choly shit\u201d moments that Martin revealed about the story, with another being Stannis (Stephen Dillane) burning Shireen (Kerry Ingram).\nThe third is \u201cfrom the very end,\u201d Benioff told Entertainment Weekly in 2016.\nIt\u2019s more likely than not that Daenerys burning King\u2019s Landing is this third moment.\n\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d has been teasing this specific Daenerys turn from at least as early as\u00a0Season 4\u2032s\u00a0\u201cThe Lion and the Rose,\u201d the last episode Martin wrote for the series. In that episode, the audience sees a rapid-fire montage of Bran\u2019s (Isaac Hempstead Wright) visions. One of those images appears to be a shot of what we now know to be Drogon\u2019s shadow as he and Dany prepare to burn King\u2019s Landing to the ground.\nThese \u201cbroad strokes\u201d may explain the fandom\u2019s disconnect.\nWhile the moment could happen in both the show and the books, the way their respective creators get there will drastically differ. Martin has explicitly said, for example, that while that Hodor reveal from Season 6 will be in the books, it\u2019s going to be \u201cvery different\u201d in his story.\nOf course it would be. For all intents and purposes, the showrunners were crafting the story based on Martin\u2019s CliffsNotes. And anyone who\u2019s blown off required reading in high school in favor of CliffsNotes can probably tell you that you can get a passing grade, but if you need to get granular, you\u2019re SOL.\nIf the showrunners are just working toward Martin\u2019s conclusion (despite their stories being very different at this point), the lack of connective tissue that Martin\u2019s novels brought to earlier seasons is just compounded by the advanced timeline of the post-book seasons. Things move fast now: In Season 8, Jaime Lannister (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) gets with Brienne (Gwendoline Christie) then leaves her in the same episode, Euron (Pilou Asb\u00e6k) becomes a crossbow dragon slayer in an instant and Arya goes from telling the Starks they need to stick together to peacing out and riding south with the Hound (Rory McCann) for King\u2019s Landing five minutes later.\nOn his own Not A Blog, Martin himself said even he has to resist the temptation to write in shortcuts so characters got to where they needed to go quicker.\nTo one user in the comments, he wrote of \u201cthe number of time\u201d he\u2019s \u201cwanted to introduce a magical portal, and/or have my characters click their heels together and say, \u2018There\u2019s no place like King\u2019s Landing.\u2019\u201d\nAs previously mentioned, Martin stopped writing scripts for the show after Season 4, and supposedly doesn\u2019t know exactly how the TV adaptation will end. In a recent interview with Rolling Stone, he reiterated that \u201cmajor points of the ending will be things that I told them,\u201d but he expects there to be changes.\nLeaving out or abbreviating plot details is a problem for a fandom obsessed with those details. Some of the smallest minutiae in the books, and in the early seasons of \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d have inspired some of the most popular fan theories, countless rewatches and endless pages of critical analysis. For both those who have and haven\u2019t read the book series, the most interesting question isn\u2019t who sits on the Iron Throne but rather how they get there.\nIf the same Dany twist happens in the books, it will likely still feel like a controversial move, even with Martin allowing himself thousands of pages in his novels to set it up. But watching the show without those details, as well as cramming everything from the final season into only six episodes, doesn\u2019t necessarily set up this moment to land.\u00a0\nDespite the speedy finish, no one can disagree that this final season has been a spectacle, coffee cup be damned. It\u2019s just that without the story details linking narratives from point A to point B, sometimes the payoff can just leave you feeling, well, mad.", "date": "\n05/13/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/daenerys-twist-game-of-thrones_n_5cd5d361e4b0705e47dc18c3", "tags": "dany badly episode books season show \u201d one twist martin thrones burns daenerys"}
