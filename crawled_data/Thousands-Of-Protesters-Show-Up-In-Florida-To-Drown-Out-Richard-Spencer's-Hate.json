{"title": "Thousands Of Protesters Show Up In Florida To Drown Out Richard Spencer's Hate", "content": "GAINESVILLE, Fla. \u2014 Thousands of people turned out on Thursday at the University of Florida to protest an afternoon speech by a prominent white supremacist, making their message clear: Richard Spencer, and those like him, are not welcome.\u00a0\nWell before Spencer\u2019s speech at a place that did not invite him, a mass of protesters was on hand to greet him. By the time Spencer took the stage at the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts, he was met by a small group of supporters and a larger group of activists.\n\u00a0Protesters chanted \u201cFuck you Spencer!\u201d and \u201cGo home Spencer!\u201d as the white supremacist spoke.\n\u201cI love you too,\u201d he said.\nSpencer was routinely shouted down as he praised President Donald Trump, expressed concern that the man accused of killing Heather Heyer in Charlottesville, Virginia, this summer won\u2019t get a fair trial, and defended his ideology. But mostly, Spencer complained to the crowd for heckling him and drowning out his remarks.\n\u201cYou are yelling at a dissident intellectual!\u201d Spencer said. \u201cYou are not yelling at power!\u201d\nTaking questions from his audience, his answers were greeted with boos and various chants, including \u201cWe Don\u2019t Care\u201d and \u201cBlack Lives Matter.\u201d\nSpencer ended his appearance after close to 90 minutes with words of admonition to the demonstrators. \u201cYou think that you shut me down. Well, you didn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cThe world is not going to be proud of you.\u201d\nBefore the speech, protesters making their way to the center had chanted, \u201cNot in our town, not in our state, we don\u2019t want your Nazi hate!\u201d Other popular slogans included \u201cAlt-right you can\u2019t hide, you support genocide!\u201d and \u201cNo Trump, no KKK, no Fascist USA!\u201d\u00a0\nAt least one man was arrested on a felony charge of carrying a firearm on school property.\u00a0Sean Jeffrey Brijmohan, 28, told police he was doing private security for an unknown media outlet when they found him on campus wearing a gun on his waist. And an unidentified Nazi was photographed getting punched in the face.\n\u00a0\nThe Anti-Defamation League warned that Andrew Anglin, a neo-Nazi who runs The Daily Stormer, encouraged his followers to target Jewish and black religious and cultural institutions in the area. The intention is to make locals think that \u201cthe entire city is taken over by our guys,\u201d Anglin said in a post, according to the\u00a0 ADL.\u00a0\nIn the two months since Spencer, 39, was a featured speaker at the large white supremacist rally in Charlottesville \u2014 which was marked by violence, including James Alex Fields Jr. allegedly rammed into counter-protesters with a car, killing 32-year-old Heyer \u2014 he has been threatening to sue state universities across the country who refuse to provide him a speaking venue.\u00a0\nUniversity of Florida officials initially denied his request to speak on campus, citing security concerns, but ultimately relented. For First Amendment reasons, the university said, Spencer had to be allowed to speak, even if no one invited him.\u00a0He paid $10,000 to rent use of the Phillips Center on campus.\nGainesville Mayor Lauren Poe (D) was among many speaking out against the white supremacist.\n\u201cWe need to live our lives as normal and not let this disrupt us,\u201d Poe told HuffPost Thursday morning. \u201cBecause that\u2019s what terrorists do \u2015 they want to disrupt your life, they want to get into your psyche and make you afraid to live a normal, free life.\u201d\nWhen asked if he considers Spencer is a terrorist, the mayor said, \u201cAbsolutely, there\u2019s no question.\u201d\n\u201cHe absolutely intends to create terror in people and that\u2019s his tactic,\u201d Poe said. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that he is a terrorist leader and that his followers look to commit acts of terror to disrupt our community.\u201d\nThursday\u2019s speech was Spencer\u2019s first stop on a planned tour of college campuses across America.\nDuring the past few weeks, state, city, and college officials have worked to try to ensure that Gainesville did not become the next Charlottesville.\u00a0\nThe school spent $500,000 on security \u2014 roughly equal to the yearly tuition for 78 in-state undergraduate students.\nA large banner near the designated campus site for people to protest Spencer listed dozens of forbidden items, including backpacks, shields, fireworks, clubs, sticks or flagpoles.\u00a0\nOn Monday, Florida Gov. Rick Scott declared a state of emergency\u00a0for Spencer\u2019s appearance, citing the violence in Charlottesville.\u00a0Thursday morning,\u00a0 Gainesville was teeming with police from across the state.\u00a0\nRoads and bus routes were shut down. A university outpatient clinic and surgical center shuttered, postponing medical services to a later date. The school is officially open, but many classes were cancelled.\nOn Wednesday night, Spencer talked to HuffPost at a remote location in the Florida countryside. Standing outside the luxe ranch-style house where he was staying \u2014\u00a0for security reasons, he said\u00a0\u2014 he drank Angel\u2019s Envy bourbon and puffed on a cigar.\u00a0\nA dozen or so other white nationalists were with him, among them Identity Evropa leader Eli Mosley, one of the main organizers of the Charlottesville event, and Evan McLaren, executive director of the National Policy Institute, which the Southern Poverty Law Center has designated as a hate group. Spencer serves as the NPI\u2019s president.\nSpencer balked when HuffPost asserted he was a Nazi. \u201cI\u2019m not a Nazi,\u201d he said. \u201cHow am I Nazi? At no point in my life have I ever been a Nazi. This is just a slur word.\u201d\u00a0\nSpencer has been seen in multiple videos giving Nazi salutes. He and his supporters chanted Nazi slogans in Charlottesville. He\u2019s called for the creation of a \u201cwhite ethno-state\u201d and the \u201cpeaceful ethnic cleansing of the United States.\u201d\nMosley, Spencer\u2019s friend and ally, has written about the \u201cstruggle for total Aryan Victory\u201d and the \u201cNazification of America.\u201d\u00a0\nGiven all that, Spencer\u2019s rebranding of organized white supremacism in America as the \u201calt-right\u201d would appear nothing more than a superficial rebranding aimed at mass appeal.\u00a0\nSpencer was unapologetic about the trouble and costs his Gainesville appearance had caused. The university\u2019s security tab? That\u2019s the fault of the far-left group Antifa and other counter-protesters \u2015 they\u2019re the violent ones, he said.\u00a0\nHe will gauge his Thursday event a success, he said, if \u201ca packed arena\u201d attends his speech, it gets a \u201csplash in terms of media\u201d and \u201cno one gets hurt.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nDuring a speech in New York City on Thursday, former President George W. Bush spoke out against people like Spencer.\n\u201cBigotry or white supremacy in any form is blasphemy against the American creed,\u201d Bush said.\u00a0\nMosley said that the rally in Charlottesville and Spencer\u2019s Gainesville speech \u2015 and future appearances by him at college campuses \u2015 are part of an effort to push their movement from an online phenomenon to one with \u201creal-life effects on the real world.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019ve accomplished that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going back. It\u2019s never going to go back. We\u2019re here to stay. People need to get used to us they need to get used to our ideas.\u201d\u00a0\nThis story has been updated with Spencer ending his remarks.
