The whole world admires your bravery. It should be an example to all of us and inspire us. You put your lives at risk in order to defend freedom.\"\nMr Hollande said: \"A terrorist decided to commit an attack. He had enough weapons and ammunition to carry out real carnage, and that's what he would have done if you hadn't tackled him at a risk to your own lives.\n\"You gave us a lesson in courage, in will, and thus in hope.\"\nHe added: \"Faced with the evil called terrorism there is a good, that is humanity. You are the incarnation of that.\"\nAnalysis: BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris\nThis was France's formal thank you to the men who set such an extraordinary example by their courage on Friday's train. The government here is making a big deal of the four heroes (plus their anonymous French helper) - and for good reason.\nIf the jihadist threat is to remain with us - and nothing suggests that it will stop - the behaviour of individuals towards the imminence of violence could become a crucial factor.  If more people are willing to risk their lives by standing up to fight, then that will shift the psychological battle in favour of our societies.\nGovernments know this - so do all they can to honour the people who make a stand.\nBelgian Prime Minister Charles Michel and the US Ambassador to France, Jane Hartley, attended the ceremony, along with the head of the French rail firm, SNCF.\nThe Legion d'honneur was founded by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1802. The award is divided into five categories and the passengers are receiving the chevalier, the most commonly awarded. \nA French-American passenger who was wounded in the attack, and a French citizen who first encountered the gunman and tried to overpower him, will receive the honour later.\nMr Hollande named the French-American as 51-year-old Mark Moogalian, who is still in hospital. The other man wishes to remain anonymous.\nThe president said he wished to pay tribute to both of them for their bravery.\nMr Moogalian's wife told BFM TV her husband had seen the Frenchman tackle the suspect and had tried to intervene but was shot in the neck.\nThe Americans spoke on Sunday about the incident.\nMr Stone, an off-duty US airman, said he had just woken from a deep sleep when he saw the gunman and moved to restrain him.\n\"I turned around and I saw he had what looked to be an AK-47 and it looked like it was jammed or wasn't working and he was trying to charge the weapon.\n\"Alek just hit me on the shoulder and said 'Let's go' and ran down, tackled him. We hit the ground.\"\nMr Stone was the first of the three to reach the gunman. He was cut in the neck and on the eyebrow, and his thumb was almost sliced off.\nLegion d'honneur\nMr Stone also tended to Mr Moogalian, who had been shot in the neck.\nMr Hollande said Mr Stone had \"probably saved Mr Moogalian's life\".\nMr Sadler said: \"The gunman would have been successful if my friend Spencer had not gotten up. I want that lesson to be learned, in times of terror like that, to please do something. Don't just stand by and watch.\"\nBritish grandfather Chris Norman, an IT expert, said he helped the Americans subdue the gunman because he thought he was \"probably going to die anyway\".\nHe said after receiving his award on Monday: \"I am amazed and I really appreciate this honour.\"\nUnder French law, authorities have until Tuesday evening to question the suspect.\nSophie David, a lawyer assigned to the case for Mr Khazzani, said the Moroccan was \"dumbfounded that his act is being linked to terrorism\" and that he had said he found the weapons in a Belgian park and wanted to rob passengers.\nMr Khazzani's father, Mohamed el-Khazzani, told the Daily Telegraph in Algeciras, Spain, that his son was a \"good boy\" interested in \"football and fishing\".\n\"I have no idea what he was thinking and I have not spoken to him for over a year,\" Mohamed el-Khazzani said.\nAyoub el-Khazzani was flagged up to French authorities by Spanish counterparts in February 2014. \nHe is reported to have lived in France, Spain, and Belgium and to have travelled to Syria.", "date": "24 August 2015", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-34037580", "tags": "shooting us legion stone french passengers el-khazzani honour train said hollande france awards"}
