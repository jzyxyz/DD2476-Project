{"title": "What Is Obstruction of Justice? An Often Murky Crime, Explained", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Tuesday\u2019s report by The New York Times that President Trump asked James B. Comey, then the F.B.I. director, in February to drop the investigation into his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, has fueled accusations that the White House is obstructing justice.\nSenator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, wrote on Twitter: \u201cJust leaving Senate floor. Lots of chatter from Ds and Rs about the exact definition of \u2018obstruction of justice.\u2019\u201d\nMr. Trump abruptly fired Mr. Comey last week, and later told NBC News that he was thinking about the F.B.I.\u2019s investigation into contacts between his campaign associates and Russia, which he has derided as fake news, when he did so. (The investigation into Mr. Flynn is separate but related.)\nMr. Trump also then appeared to threaten Mr. Comey in a post on Twitter. After a report that Mr. Trump had asked Mr. Comey whether he was loyal to him, the president said Mr. Comey \u201cbetter hope that there are no \u2018tapes\u2019 of our conversations.\u201d\nMr. Trump has denied that he asked Mr. Comey to close the F.B.I. investigation into Mr. Flynn. In a statement on Tuesday, the White House said, \u201cThe president has never asked Mr. Comey or anyone else to end any investigation, including any investigation involving General Flynn.\u201d\n\u201cThe president has the utmost respect for our law enforcement agencies, and all investigations,\u201d the White House statement said. \u201cThis is not a truthful or accurate portrayal of the conversation between the president and Mr. Comey.\u201d\nSeveral federal statutes criminalize actions that impede official investigations. While some examples of illegal ways to thwart the justice system are specific \u2014 like killing a witness or destroying evidence \u2014 the law also includes broad, catchall prohibitions. For example, Sections 1503, 1505 and 1512 of Title 18 have variants of language making it a crime if someone corruptly \u201cobstructs, influences or impedes any official proceeding.\u201d\nIn theory, yes. Such statutes were broadly drafted. Julie O\u2019Sullivan, a former federal prosecutor who now teaches white-collar criminal law at Georgetown University, said the power relationship between a president and the F.B.I. director could elevate a request to shut down a case into an act that amounts to impeding an official investigation.\n\u201cHe really needs a lawyer,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Sullivan said of Mr. Trump. \u201cHe is building a beautiful case against himself.\u201d\nYes. But courts have ruled that otherwise lawful acts can constitute obstruction of justice if done with corrupt intentions. In a 1998 case, for example, a federal appeals court upheld the conviction of a lawyer who had filed legal complaints and related motions against a government agent who was investigating an illegal gambling operation. The court ruled that the defendant\u2019s \u201cnominally litigation-related conduct\u201d was unlawful because his real motive was \u201cto safeguard his personal financial interests\u201d in the corrupt enterprise.\nObstruction of justice cases often come down to whether prosecutors can prove defendants\u2019 mental state when they committed the act, legal specialists said. It is not enough to show that a defendant knew the act would have a side consequence of impeding an investigation; achieving that obstruction has to have been the specific intention.\nSamuel Buell, a former federal prosecutor who led the Justice Department\u2019s Enron task force and now teaches criminal law at Duke University, was initially skeptical about whether the mere firing of Mr. Comey could prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Trump had an improper mental state. But he said on Tuesday that subsequent revelations have made the evidence much more robust.\n\u201cThe evidence of improper purpose has gotten much stronger since the day of Comey\u2019s firing,\u201d Mr. Buell said. \u201cTrump has made admissions about that. And we now have evidence that he may have indicated an improper purpose previously in his communications with Comey about the Russia investigation.\u201d\nMs. O\u2019Sullivan said it was not realistic to expect the Trump administration\u2019s Justice Department to charge the sitting president. And Mr. Buell argued that the developments had strengthened the case for Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, who is overseeing the investigation because Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself, to appoint a special counsel to handle it.\n\u201cThe issue right now is whether there needs to be a serious impartial investigation, and there can be no doubt about that at this point,\u201d said Mr. Buell, who said the developments showed that Mr. Comey needed to be interviewed as a witness. \u201cThis kind of drip, drip, drip \u2014 we keep addressing this scenario as \u2018here is the evidence, what is the result,\u2019 but that\u2019s only good until tomorrow when something else comes out. It is not at all clear that this is the end. If anything, it has become clearer that there is more to know.\u201d\n\u201cAsking FBI to drop an investigation is obstruction of justice,\u201d Representative Ted Deutch, Democrat of Florida, wrote on Twitter on Tuesday. \u201cObstruction of justice is an impeachable offense.\u201d\nBoth American presidents who were subjected to impeachment proceedings in the last century \u2014 Bill Clinton in 1998 and Richard M. Nixon in 1974 \u2014 were accused of obstruction of justice.\nWhile it can be a murky task in court to interpret the obstruction statutes, said David Sklansky, a former federal prosecutor who teaches at Stanford, impeachment proceedings are different. They are a \u201cquasi-judicial, quasi-political process,\u201d he noted; the House and the Senate determine for themselves whether the standards are met.\nIn other words, as a practical matter, the Constitution\u2019s standards for impeachment and removal of a president \u2014 if he has committed \u201ctreason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\u201d \u2014 are met by anything that a majority of the House and two-thirds of the Senate are willing to vote for.\nThat makes prognostication an exercise in vote counting, not legal analysis.", "date": "May 16, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/16/us/politics/obstruction-of-justice-explained-russia-investigation.html", "tags": "\u201c comey often investigation explained justice crime murky obstruction said \u2014"}
