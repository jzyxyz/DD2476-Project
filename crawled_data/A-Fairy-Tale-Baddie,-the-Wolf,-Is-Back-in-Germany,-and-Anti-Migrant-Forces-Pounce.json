{"title": "A Fairy-Tale Baddie, the Wolf, Is Back in Germany, and Anti-Migrant Forces Pounce", "content": "F\u00d6RSTGEN, Germany \u2014 They struck at dawn and left a trail of blood and body parts.\nThere were six, maybe seven perpetrators. One had calmly passed Annett Hertweck\u2019s car as she was speeding down the forest path to the scene of the massacre near the eastern village of F\u00f6rstgen, Germany. Only then did she see the bodies. Dozens of them.\n\u201cIt was horrific,\u201d she said.\nThe culprits were wolves, descended from Polish forebears. The victims were German sheep, 55 of them.\nExtinct for the best part of a century, Germany\u2019s most notorious fairy-tale baddie is back.\nWolves have been slipping across the Polish border for years, gradually settling into rural Germany. There are only a few hundred of them.\nBut to hear some politicians tell it, the country is facing an invasion. And the way they talk about wolves is strikingly similar to how they talk about immigrants, turning the animal into an object of terror \u2014 and the discussion into an allegory for the nation\u2019s simmering culture wars. Between urban elites and rural left-behinds. Between west and east.\nAnd also between those who welcome wolves \u2014 and immigrants \u2014 and those who fear them.\n\u201cThe wolf polarizes, it touches something deep inside of us,\u201d said Ms. Hertweck, who runs a biosphere reserve with 500 sheep and describes herself as pro-wolf.\n\u201cThe wolf is the perfect scapegoat for our times,\u201d she added, cast as a type of criminal foreigner \u201cwith teeth instead of knives\u201d who is \u201cprotected by the elites.\u201d\nIn the home of the Brothers Grimm, where the big, bad wolf has been the stuff of children\u2019s nightmares for generations, it is now also the stuff of populist election manifestoes.\nWhen Karsten Hilse, an eastern lawmaker for the anti-immigrant, anti-wolf Alternative for Germany party, or AfD, talks about wolves, it sounds a lot as if he is talking about immigrants. And sometimes he is.\n\u201cThere are a lot of parallels between the settlement of wolves in Germany and the refugee crisis,\u201d Mr. Hilse said in a parliamentary debate last year.\nThe arrival of 1.2 million migrants since 2015 had led to \u201crapes, murders, attacks on police officers,\u201d he said, adding that most migrants live on German welfare. \u201cThe same goes for wolves,\u201d he said, presumably referring to public subsidies for wolf protection measures and compensation for killed farm animals.\nWolves and what to do with them has become a central campaign issue in three hard-fought regional elections in the former Communist East this year, where the number of wolves is highest \u2014 and the far-right is strong.\nSome want to shoot the wolf, seeing a dangerous predator who is a threat not just to lambs but to children and a familiar way of life. Others see the animal as an endangered species that needs protection.\nThe woman in charge of the wolf issue at the local chapter of the AfD in eastern Saxony is called Silke Grimm, no relation to the Grimm brothers.\nMs. Grimm has been campaigning in favor of hunting wolves since 2014. \u201cAt the time the others laughed at us,\u201d she said. \u201cNow they are copying us.\u201d\nIn her small office near the Polish and Czech borders, Ms. Grimm handed out two pamphlets. One was about Islam and why it was incompatible with German culture.\nThe other was about wolves and why the current number of them was incompatible with Saxony\u2019s \u201ccultural landscape.\u201d\nLike the \u201cceiling\u201d the AfD has demanded for the number of asylum seekers Germany can tolerate, the leaflet demands a \u201cceiling\u201d for wolves.\nIt also advises children not to be in the forest by themselves. On the cover a wolf is seen trotting through a residential area with its teeth bared, an abandoned teddy bear in the foreground.\n\u201cWolves are dangerous and they breed explosively,\u201d Ms. Grimm said. \u201cThe official line is it\u2019s all under control. We know that line from the refugee crisis. No one believes a word of it.\u201d\nOver the last century, there have been no reported cases of a wolf killing a human in Germany, said Vanessa Ludwig, a biologist at the wolf information office for the regional government. The last known death in Western Europe was in Spain in the 1960s.\nThe German authorities have counted 73 packs of wolves, 31 wolf couples and three lone wolves across the country \u2014 perhaps 700 animals in total.\n\u201cThere is no wolf crisis,\u201d said Ms. Ludwig, who remembers exactly when wolves became political. \u201cIt was in 2015, during the refugee crisis,\u201d she said. Since then, \u201cit has been one big emotional storm.\u201d\nAnd as with migrants, when it comes to the wolf, emotions seems to matter more than facts.\nEveryone in Saxony knows Grimm\u2019s fairy tales. And everyone knows the story of Lolek and Bolek.\nLolek and Bolek were two goats kept in the backyard of the nursery in the village of Uhsmannsdorf. One night, a wolf came. First Lolek was gone. Two weeks later, Bolek was gone, too. Now the children are no longer taken into the nearby forest.\nThe local mayor, Heike B\u00f6hm, walks in the forest every day. \u201cThe story of Lolek and Bolek has reinforced fears that the place is overrun with wolves,\u201d Ms. B\u00f6hm said. \u201cI have never seen one.\u201d\nWhen Chancellor Angela Merkel met with fellow conservatives in the region last year, Lolek and Bolek came up, too. Ms. Merkel said that \u201cwhere necessary,\u201d the wolf should be hunted. Her environment minister is now mulling a law that would make it easier to shoot \u201cproblem wolves.\u201d\nSome aren\u2019t waiting for the law. The dead body of a wolf was found floating in an area lake. The animal had been shot in the head, then sunk in the water with a block of cement tied around its body to weigh it down. Executed, mafia-style.\nIn the early 19th century, when the Grimm brothers collected their fairy tales, wolves presented an existential threat to small farmers in an agrarian society. The wolf was portrayed as the ultimate villain, a scheming predator who goes after women, children and livelihood.\nIn \u201cThe Wolf and the Seven Goats,\u201d he gobbles up six of seven baby goats. In \u201cLittle Red Riding Hood,\u201d he swallows first granny, then the little girl.\n\u201cYou can explain that fairy tales are only fairy tales but that alone won\u2019t do,\u201d said Ms. Ludwig of the regional government. \u201cThe psychology is complex because of the long history of the wolf in German folklore.\u201d\n\u201cLittle Red Riding Hood syndrome,\u201d she called it.\nAs in fairy tales, so in politics, the wolf represents more than one thing. Thirty years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, wolves have come to embody the resentment some easterners feel about what they experienced as a western takeover.\nUnder Communism, wolves who came across the border were shot. After reunification, wolves became a \u201chighly protected species\u201d under European Union rules.\nThe wolf was seen as a winner of reunification, while some farmers here feel like losers \u2014 without much money, lacking status they once had and losing their children to the west.\n\u201cAnd now the wolf comes and eats their sheep,\u201d said Ms. Hertweck, the witness to the sheep massacre. \u201cI can understand their anger.\u201d\nA short drive away, Stephan Kaasche, a nature guide, was running a workshop with 10-year-olds. He pulled out a wolf skull, opened its jaw wide and held it above one girl\u2019s head.\n\u201cSee?\u201d he said. \u201cThe wolf cannot swallow you whole.\u201d\nFor Mr. Kaasche, the current hysteria about wolves \u201csays nothing about wolves and a lot about human nature.\u201d\nPeople\u2019s grievances are real, but they have nothing to do with the wolf, he said. Politicians who pretend otherwise are \u201clike a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing.\u201d", "date": "April 23, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/23/world/europe/germany-wolves-afd-immigration.html", "tags": "forces baddie fairy-tale germany wolf back pounce \u201d one grimm ms. \u2014 anti-migrant wolves"}
