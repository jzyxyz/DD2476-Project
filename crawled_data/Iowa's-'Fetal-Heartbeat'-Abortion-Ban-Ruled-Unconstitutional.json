{"title": "Iowa's 'Fetal Heartbeat' Abortion Ban Ruled Unconstitutional", "content": "Iowa\u2019s \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d law, the most restrictive abortion ban in the United States, was declared unconstitutional Tuesday, as it violates the Iowa state constitution, a state judge ruled.\nIowa\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature passed the restriction in May 2018, outlawing the procedure after a fetal heartbeat is detected, often at six weeks and before a woman realizes she is pregnant.\nIn the ruling, posted online, District Court Judge Michael Huppert wrote, \u201cIt is undisputed that such cardiac activity is detectable well in advance of the fetus becoming viable.\u201d\nA fetus that is viable outside the womb, usually at 24 weeks, is widely considered the threshold in the United States to prohibit an abortion.\nThe district court decision is a victory for supporters of abortion rights, but abortion opponents have vowed to take the fight to Iowa\u2019s appellate courts, the Des Moines Register and other media reported.\nThe legislation is aimed at triggering a challenge to Roe v. Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 1973 landmark decision which established that women have a constitutional right to an abortion, activists on both sides of the issue previously told Reuters.\nIowa state Sen. Janet Petersen of Des Moines, the Democrats\u2019 leader in the Iowa Senate, praised the ruling.\n\u201cThe extreme law should have been overturned, because it restricted the freedom of Iowa women and girls to care for their bodies, and it forced motherhood on them,\u201d she told the Register. \u201cThe governor and legislative Republicans should stop attacking women\u2019s health care.\u201d\nProponents of the law had expected a long court fight.\nThe ultimate goal, abortion opponents have told multiple media outlets, is to get the case before the U.S. Supreme Court, which has become more conservative under President Donald Trump.\nWhen the Iowa law was first passed, Republican state senator Rick Bertand of Sioux City told Reuters, \u201cWe created an opportunity to take a run at Roe v. Wade - 100 percent.\u201d\n(Editing by Nick Macfie)", "date": "\n01/23/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/iowa-fetal-heartbeat-abortion-ban-ruled-unconstitutional_n_5c48498ae4b0b669367573a7", "tags": "unconstitutional heartbeat iowa fetal court ruled \u201d abortion state told women ban law"}
