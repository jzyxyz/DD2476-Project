{"title": "Jeremy Corbyn, Backing a \u2018Soft\u2019 Brexit, Takes Aim at Conservatives", "content": "LONDON \u2014 The leader of Britain\u2019s opposition party, Jeremy Corbyn, tried on Monday to position Labour as the standard-bearer of a \u201csoft\u201d exit from the European Union, narrowing the maneuvering room for Theresa May, the country\u2019s already weakened prime minister.\nIn a much-anticipated speech, Mr. Corbyn proposed that Britain remain in a customs union with European Union member states when it leaves the bloc, to soften the economic shock of an abrupt exit.\nHe made that position conditional on Britain being able to take part with the European Union in negotiating trade deals with other countries, a notion Brussels has so far steadfastly resisted.\nMr. Corbyn\u2019s shift on the customs union, which eliminates tariffs and reduces other barriers to trade between members, was immediately welcomed by two major British business organizations \u2014 a significant step, since British industry has traditionally seen the Conservatives as the more business friendly party.\nBritish firms \u201cneed government to focus on making access to markets simpler, not putting up barriers to our most important trading partner,\u201d Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the Confederation of British Industry, said in a statement.\nThe group said that Mr. Corbyn\u2019s plan would \u201cput jobs and living standards first by remaining in a close economic relationship with the E.U.\u201d\nThe Labour leader came under attack from people in both parties who support Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, who said he had abandoned his long-held principles for political advantage. A terse statement from Mrs. May\u2019s office said that she stood by her rejection of any form of customs union after Brexit.\n\u201cThe government will not be joining a customs union,\u201d the statement  said. \u201cWe want to have the freedom to sign our own trade deals and to reach out into the world.\u201d\nMr. Corbyn stopped short of recommending that Britain remain in the single market, which would allow for the continued free movement of people, services and goods among member states, as advocated by his party\u2019s strong anti-Brexit faction. But there, too, he left open plenty of room for interpretation, saying he backed a \u201cnew and strong relationship with the single market\u201d that would include tariff-free access.\n\u201cLabour would seek a final deal that gives full access to European markets and maintains the benefits of the single market and the customs union,\u201d Mr. Corbyn said, \u201cwith no new impediments to trade and no reduction in rights, standards and protections.\u201d\nHe also said it made \u201cno sense\u201d for Britain to abandon the European Union\u2019s rule-making agencies for things like food safety and chemicals.\nMr. Corbyn, a longtime euroskeptic, has been moving slowly toward a softer view on Britain\u2019s exit from the union, dragged there by his chief Brexit strategist, Keir Starmer, and others in the party. But his shift also has a strategic component, seemingly timed to inflict maximum damage to the political fortunes of Mrs. May, whose Conservative Party is deeply divided over the process.\nBy claiming the moderate space in the Brexit debate, Mr. Corbyn could draw rebels in Mrs. May\u2019s party into a \u201csoft Brexit\u201d voting bloc capable of defeating Mrs. May\u2019s legislation in Parliament. That could happen sometime after Easter.\nThe Labour leader has announced the shift amid signs that public support on the issue may be softening.\n\u201cLabour respects the result of the referendum, and Britain is leaving the E.U.,\u201d he said, referring to the June 2016 vote on whether to leave the bloc. \u201cBut we will not support any Tory deal that would do lasting damage to jobs, rights and living standards.\u201d\nTwenty months after the referendum, in which 52 percent of voters advocated leaving the union and 48 percent opposed it, the government has not articulated a unified strategy on doing so, and business leaders are expressing growing alarm about the possible threats to the economy.\nMrs. May has seemed eager to steer a middle path, but she is under pressure from hard-liners in her party who advocate severing ties with the single market and customs union, and steering the country toward a low-regulation, low-tax economy.\nMr. Corbyn mocked Tory infighting over the terms of the deal on Monday, joking that \u201canything agreed at breakfast is being briefed against at lunch and abandoned at teatime,\u201d and tried to present himself as a voice of sanity.\n\u201cThe European Union is not the root of all our problems, and leaving it will not solve all our problems,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be some who will tell you that Brexit is a disaster for our country, and some who will tell you that Brexit will create a land of milk and honey. The truth is more down to earth, and it\u2019s in our hands.\u201d\nConservatives had attacked Mr. Corbyn in advance of the speech, describing his promise of renegotiated trade deals as unrealistic. Iain Duncan Smith, a former leader of the Conservatives, also warned potential defectors in the party against being swayed by Mr. Corbyn.\n\u201cBe very careful on this one, because you\u2019re being invited into a Labour Party tactical game, which will actually end up in real damage to the United Kingdom,\u201d he told the BBC.\nKeir Starmer, Mr. Corbyn\u2019s chief adviser on Brexit, predicted that Mrs. May would face a rebellion.\n\u201cCrunchtime is now coming for the prime minister, because the majority in Parliament does not back her approach to a customs union\u201d and \u201cwill be heard sooner or later,\u201d he said.\nReactions to the speech divided neatly along positions on Brexit.\nGeorge Osborne, a Conservative opponent of leaving the European Union who served as chancellor of the Exchequer from 2010 to 2016, wrote in The Evening Standard that Mrs. May had made a fatal mistake by appeasing hard-core Brexiteers, and that Mr. Corbyn had \u201copened up the looming prospect of suffering a huge defeat in the Commons.\u201d\n\u201cThe Tories gifted Corbyn with an open goal on customs union, and he just put the ball in,\u201d he remarked, in a Twitter post.\nBut David Bannerman, a Conservative legislator and avid supporter of leaving the bloc, described Mr. Corbyn\u2019s proposal in a Twitter post as \u201ca \u2018dog\u2019s Breakfast Brexit\u2019 \u2014 a half baked shambles: hurts the poor through keeping EU tariffs, betrays Labour voters on immigration controls & abandons the world for the EU, despite 90% future growth coming from outside Europe.\u201d", "date": "Feb. 26, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/world/europe/jeremy-corbyn-brexit.html", "tags": "brexit may \u2018 soft party union takes aim corbyn jeremy \u201d britain conservatives backing said"}
