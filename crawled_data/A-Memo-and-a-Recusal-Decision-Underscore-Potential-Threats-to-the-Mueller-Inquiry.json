{"title": "A Memo and a Recusal Decision Underscore Potential Threats to the Mueller Inquiry", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Matthew G. Whitaker, who was installed last month as acting attorney general by President Trump, has cleared himself to supervise the special counsel\u2019s investigation, rejecting the recommendation of career Justice Department ethics specialists that he recuse himself, according to a letter the department sent to Senate leaders on Thursday night.\n[Read the letter.]\nThe development came soon after the disclosure that the president\u2019s nominee for attorney general, William P. Barr, had written a memo this spring in which he strongly criticized one of the main lines of inquiry by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III \u2014 whether Mr. Trump had committed obstruction of justice. Disclosure of the memo raised questions about whether Mr. Barr would order Mr. Mueller to shut down that component of the inquiry if the Senate confirmed him.\nTogether, the developments underscored the potential threats to Mr. Mueller\u2019s ability to complete his work without interference at a time when his inquiry appears to be drawing closer to the White House and the president\u2019s most trusted associates.\n\u201cIt\u2019s becoming pretty clear that the president is basing his choices for leadership at the Justice Department on candidates\u2019 criticism of the Mueller investigation,\u201d Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, wrote on Twitter. \u201cWe can all see what\u2019s happening here. It\u2019s past time for Congress to pass bipartisan legislation protecting the special counsel\u2019s investigation from political interference,\u201d he said.\nBoth developments trace back to Mr. Trump\u2019s decision, a day after the midterm elections in which Democrats won control of the House last month, to oust Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Enraging Mr. Trump, Mr. Sessions had recused himself from overseeing investigations related to the 2016 election on the advice of department ethics officials because of his ties to the Trump campaign.\nMr. Sessions\u2019s recusal left the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, in the role of acting attorney general for the investigation into whether the Trump campaign conspired with Russia in its election-interference operation, and whether Mr. Trump later obstructed justice.\nAfter firing Mr. Sessions, Mr. Trump named Mr. Whitaker \u2014 whom the White House had earlier imposed on Mr. Sessions as his chief of staff \u2014 the acting attorney general until the Senate confirms a successor. He then nominated Mr. Barr, who had served as attorney general under President George Bush, for the position.\nThe immediate question raised by Mr. Trump\u2019s postelection maneuvers was whether Mr. Whitaker would, like Mr. Sessions before him, recuse himself from overseeing the Russia investigation. Mr. Whitaker had publicly denigrated the special counsel inquiry before joining the administration; had worked on the campaign of a witness in the investigation, Sam Clovis; and had earlier interviewed with the White House to be its top in-house counsel for defending against the special counsel.\nThe Justice Department had refused to answer questions about whether ethics officials cleared Mr. Whitaker to take over supervision of Mr. Mueller. A senior department official said on Thursday that Mr. Whitaker had not been receiving briefings on the special counsel investigation, but had decided on Wednesday that he would not recuse himself and would instead assume final say over major investigative or prosecutorial actions Mr. Mueller wants to take.\nThe scope of the ethics conversation was limited to the statements about the inquiry that Mr. Whitaker made before joining the department. In the letter \u2014 addressed to Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican majority leader, and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader \u2014 the Justice Department noted that no previous attorney general or senior department official had stepped down from a matter \u201cbased upon statements made in the media.\u201d\nSeparately, the Justice Department provided to the Senate Judiciary Committee late on Wednesday a package of Mr. Barr\u2019s writings and speeches. The documents included a 19-page, apparently unsolicited memo Mr. Barr sent to senior department officials in June in which he sharply criticized Mr. Mueller\u2019s focus on whether Mr. Trump had obstructed justice.\n[Read Mr. Barr\u2019s memo.]\nPublic speculation about an obstruction charge has focused on actions like Mr. Trump\u2019s pressuring the F.B.I. director at the time, James B. Comey, to quash a criminal investigation into his first national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, for lying to investigators about his conversations with the Russian ambassador; Mr. Trump\u2019s firing of Mr. Comey; and the president\u2019s seeming dangling of potential pardons at witnesses in Mr. Mueller\u2019s inquiry.\nWhile acknowledging in his memo that he was \u201cin the dark about many facts,\u201d Mr. Barr argued that the Justice Department must not accept the notion that a president can violate a statute that criminalizes obstruction of justice when he is exercising his constitutional authority in an otherwise lawful way \u2014 such as by firing a subordinate, pardoning someone or using his \u201ccomplete authority to start or stop a law enforcement proceeding\u201d \u2014 but with a corrupt motive.\n\u201cMueller\u2019s obstruction theory is fatally misconceived,\u201d Mr. Barr wrote. \u201cAs I understand it, his theory is premised on a novel and legally insupportable reading of the law. Moreover, in my view, if credited by the department, it would have grave consequences far beyond the immediate confines of this case and would do lasting damage to the presidency and to the administration of law within the executive branch.\u201d\nMr. Barr\u2019s memo was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.\nSeveral Democrats reacted to the memo and the recusal decision with alarm. Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, who will soon become chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, suggested that Mr. Whitaker was more concerned with satisfying Mr. Trump than protecting the department\u2019s integrity. He said he would grill Mr. Whitaker at an oversight hearing next month.\nSenator Dianne Feinstein of California, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, called Mr. Barr\u2019s memo \u201cvery troubling\u201d and portrayed it as essentially concluding that \u201cthe president is above the law.\u201d\n\u201cWe need answers as to why Barr proactively drafted this memo and then shared it with the deputy attorney general and President Trump\u2019s lawyers,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for a lawyer in private practice to do this unless he was attempting to curry favor with President Trump and convey that he would protect the president.\u201d\nIn criticizing the notion that the obstruction law can be applied to otherwise lawful presidential actions if they are undertaken with a corrupt motive, Mr. Barr argued that it would open the door to submitting not only presidents but also ordinary Justice Department prosecutors to the risk of second-guessing via criminal grand jury investigations.\n\u201cIf embraced by the department, this theory would have potentially disastrous implications, not just for the presidency, but for the executive branch as a whole and for the department in particular,\u201d he wrote.\nSeveral law professors criticized Mr. Barr\u2019s memo, saying that it failed to address arguments against its conclusions. Appeals courts, they said, have ruled that acts that would otherwise would be lawful exercises of one\u2019s rights, like a lawyer filing motions against the government, can constitute obstruction of justice if done with corrupt intentions.\nAnd in an analysis on the legal blog Just Security, Martin Lederman, a Georgetown University law professor and former Office of Legal Counsel official in the Clinton and Obama administrations, criticized Mr. Barr for claiming that the Constitution gives the president \u201call encompassing\u201d and \u201cillimitable\u201d power over law-enforcement matters.\nSuch \u201cbreathtaking claims,\u201d Mr. Lederman wrote, are \u201cinconsistent with vast swaths of U.S. history,\u201d including a 1988 Supreme Court precedent that Mr. Barr did not mention. In that case, the court upheld a statute in which Congress had authorized the appointment of independent counsels to investigate and prosecute executive branch wrongdoing outside the president\u2019s control.\nOther legal experts expressed surprise at how Mr. Whitaker had addressed ethics questions: Rather than requesting a formal ethics vetting and opinion under Justice Department regulations, he engaged in an informal conversation with the department\u2019s career ethics lawyers that focused on statements like those he had made as a political commentator.\nAfter reviewing the matter, the ethics lawyers said the decision was a \u201cclose call\u201d but advised Mr. Whitaker to recuse himself to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest, the senior department official said. But the decision ultimately rested with Mr. Whitaker, under department rules.\nMr. Whitaker separately brought together his own ad hoc advisory council of four political appointees within the department, including an unidentified United States attorney.\nThey recommended that he not recuse himself, arguing that there was no precedent for an attorney general to step aside solely because of appearances, the official said.", "date": "Dec. 20, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/20/us/politics/barr-whitaker-mueller-trump.html", "tags": "inquiry underscore department would \u201d justice potential memo recusal barr decision threats mueller whitaker"}
