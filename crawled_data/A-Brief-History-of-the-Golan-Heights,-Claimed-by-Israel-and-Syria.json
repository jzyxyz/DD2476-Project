{"title": "A Brief History of the Golan Heights, Claimed by Israel and Syria", "content": "With a midday tweet on Thursday, President Trump voiced his support of Israeli control over the Golan Heights, reversing decades of American policy.\nThe move thrust the Golan Heights \u2014 a fertile plateau beside the Sea of Galilee that has been one of Israel\u2019s quieter frontiers for a half-century \u2014 back into international headlines.\nThe area covers under 500 square miles and offers expansive views over Syria and Israel, giving it strategic military importance. It was seized by Israel from Syria during the Six-Day War of 1967, and since then, it has been claimed by both countries.\n[The Golan Heights was once an Arab rallying cry. Not anymore.]\nThe Six-Day War of June 1967 ended in decisive victories for Israel, which seized the Golan Heights from Syria. Syrian forces began a failed attempt to reclaim the territory in 1973. That war ended with an armistice that left most of the Golan Heights in Israeli hands. In 1981, Israel passed a law that effectively annexed it.\nBut that move was never recognized internationally, and a United Nations Security Council resolution that year said that \u201cthe Israeli decision to impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration in the occupied Syrian Golan Heights is null and void and without international legal effect.\u201d\nThere have been halting negotiations over the Golan Heights, but in 2011 the conflict in Syria introduced new tensions to the area and effectively shut down those efforts.\nThe Golan Heights is not densely populated. According to some estimates, there are around 50,000 people, with Israeli Jewish settlers making up nearly half. The rest are mostly people of Syrian ancestry who are Druze, a religion that has been described as an offshoot of Ismaili Islam.\n[Sign up for the weekly At War newsletter to receive stories about conflict and consequence.]\nDruze residents of the Golan Heights have largely resisted obtaining Israeli citizenship and have maintained a strong connection to Syria for decades. Despite the proximity \u2014 megaphones and binoculars have connected people in the Golan Heights with friends across the border \u2014 that connection has been tested by the devastating conflict in Syria.\nBut over all, life in the Golan Heights has been relatively tranquil compared with other places on Israel\u2019s frontiers.\nFor decades, the United Nations and the United States refused to recognize Israel\u2019s seizure of the Golan Heights and the West Bank in 1967, arguing that the contours of Israel must be negotiated diplomatically.\nBut President Trump tweeted on Thursday that \u201cit is time for the United States to fully recognize Israel\u2019s Sovereignty over the Golan Heights,\u201d adding that it was of critical importance to Israel and stability in the Middle East.\nHis tweet came after pressure from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, and it could help shore up support for Mr. Netanyahu in the embattled leader\u2019s bid for a fifth term in hotly contested elections scheduled for April 9.\nBut in an interview on Thursday afternoon with Fox Business Network, Mr. Trump said that he had considered recognizing the Golan Heights as part of Israel \u201cfor a long time\u201d and that his decision was not meant to boost Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s electoral chances.\nMr. Trump\u2019s tweet was not entirely out of the blue. He has already recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, moved the United States Embassy there from Tel Aviv and cut aid to Palestinian refugees. In November the United States voted for the first time against a symbolic resolution that the United Nations issues annually condemning Israel\u2019s presence in the Golan Heights.\nSince 2011, Israeli officials have expressed relief that the Golan Heights has acted as a sort of buffer for the conflict in Syria, whose president, Bashar al-Assad, is supported by Iran.\n\u201cAll of you can imagine what would have happened if Israel were not in the Golan,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said on Wednesday during a meeting with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. \u201cWe would have Iran on the shores of the Sea of Galilee.\u201d\nSyria\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, Hussam Edin Aala, warned on Wednesday against Israel\u2019s \u201cmalicious attempts to exploit the situation and the latest developments in Syria and the region to consolidate the occupation\u201d of the Golan Heights, the Syrian state news agency, SANA, reported. But critics of Mr. Assad have noted that although he and his government have frequently talked about \u201cliberating\u201d the Golan Heights, they have taken little action to do so in decades.\nOn its own, Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet is not likely to change things in the Golan Heights. There is no negotiation underway on the area\u2019s status, nor any expectation that Israel is going to withdraw from it.\nBut the announcement was the latest in a series of steps under the Trump administration that have reshaped the United States\u2019 role in conflicts between Israel and its Arab neighbors, to the benefit of Israel\u2019s right-wing government.", "date": "March 21, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/world/middleeast/golan-heights-israel.html", "tags": "syria history heights brief united israel \u201d trump israeli golan claimed"}
