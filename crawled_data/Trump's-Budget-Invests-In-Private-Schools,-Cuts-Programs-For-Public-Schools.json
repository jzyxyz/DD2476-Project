{"title": "Trump's Budget Invests In Private Schools, Cuts Programs For Public Schools", "content": "President Donald Trump wants to cut the Department of Education\u2019s budget by 13 percent, or $9 billion overall, eliminating a program that provides after-school and summer programming for kids and a professional development program for teachers.\u00a0\nYet the proposed budget adds money to school choice options, including $250 million for a \u201cnew private school choice program.\u201d This would likely be a voucher program \u2015 providing public money for kids to attend private schools \u2015 although the exact plan is still nebulous. The budget also adds $168 million for charter schools, which are publicly funded but privately operated.\u00a0\nTrump did not attend public schools as a child. His secretary of education, Betsy DeVos, also did not attend public schools or send her kids to public schools.\n\u201cThe 2018 Budget places power in the hands of parents and families to choose schools that are best for their children by investing an additional $1.4 billion in school choice programs,\u201d the budget proposal reads.\u00a0\nThe education budget also includes a $1 billion increase for Title I, a grant program that specifically targets schools serving disadvantaged students. The funding increase is intended to encourage \u201cportability,\u201d which means states and districts would allow Title I funding to follow a student if the student switches schools.\u00a0The idea was heavily debated during the creation of the new federal education law, the Every Student Succeeds Act, and was defeated at that time. Democrats argued that portability would ultimately strip schools serving high concentrations of poor students of necessary funding and could pave the way for private school vouchers.\u00a0\nOn the higher education front, the budget continues to fund Pell Grants, which help poor students go to college, at the current level, but proposes a \u201ccancellation of $3.9 billion from unobligated carryover funding,\u201d which would do away with surplus funding from before.\u00a0The budget also slashes other, separate programs designed to help low-income students afford college.\u00a0\nWhile the proposal does not touch programs supporting special education students, public education advocates are already decrying the impact this budget could have on schools.\n\u201cCuts to financial aid programs, including draconian cuts to the Pell Grant program, abandoning teacher support and development programs, and an ill-advised (and previously rejected) scheme to divert resources from our highest need schools would move our country backward,\u201d said John King, CEO of The Education Trust and President Barack Obama\u2019s former secretary of education,\u00a0in a statement.\u00a0\n\u201cIf this proposal were enacted, all students, particularly students of color and low-income students, throughout the entire continuum of our education system would suffer, as would the nation\u2019s businesses who desperately need a skilled workforce to be successful,\u201d King added.\nThe president of the nation\u2019s largest teacher\u2019s union \u2015 the National Education Association\u2019s Lily Eskelsen Garc\u00eda\u00a0\u2015 called the proposal \u201creckless and wrong.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cSadly, the Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos scheme to take taxpayer dollars from public schools to fund private school vouchers is misguided and would harm our students,\u201d Eskelsen Garc\u00eda said in a statement. \u201cVouchers do not work, they undermine accountability to parents and taxpayers, and they have failed to provide opportunity to all of our students.\u201d\nOn the flip side, the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools applauded the president\u2019s dedication to school choice.\n\u201cThis funding will allow more high-quality charter schools to open, expand, and replicate \u2015 and will help finance facilities for charter schools \u2015 so that more students have access to the great education they deserve,\u201d said Nina Rees, the president and CEO of the\u00a0National Alliance for Public Charter Schools,\u00a0in a statement.\u00a0\nOther charter school groups had more reservations about the new budget, however. The National Association of Charter School Authorizers said in a statement that while it appreciates the support for charter schools, it is also concerned about other cuts. \u201cCharter schools are part of\u2014not a substitute for\u2014a strong public education system,\u201d\u00a0the association\u2019s statement read.", "date": "\n03/16/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-education-budget-proposal_n_58ca86b0e4b00705db4c7acb", "tags": "public cuts \u201d trump schools education programs charter school budget students invests private"}
