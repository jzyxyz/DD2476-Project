{"title": "The 'Alt-Lite' White House Reporter Who Got Arrested At UConn Has A Heavily Racist Roadie", "content": "It was impossible to miss the heavyset man in the red \u201cMake America great again\u201d cap and hoodie. In the video of\u00a0police at the University of Connecticut hauling away far-right propagandist Lucian Wintrich\u00a0on Tuesday, he was the guy barreling after Wintrich and into the back of a cop.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m with Lucian!\u201d the man said.\u00a0\nThat was Salvatore \u201cSal\u201d Cipolla. He\u2019d been buzzing around Wintrich all night, shooting video, protecting his \u201cfaggot\u201d charge (Cipolla\u2019s word), checking on him in the bathroom as Wintrich, a race-baiting \u201calt-lite\u201d activist who works for the pro-Trump Gateway Pundit website and whom the White House has seen fit to award press credentials, applied balm to his lips before delivering an \u201cIt\u2019s OK to be white\u201d speech.\nIt was a speech the UConn College Republicans wanted to hear, one about mean fat girls and \u201ctranny\u201d communists, the crooked elite and the lying media, one accompanied by slides of Hitler and black women in bathing suits. It was a speech about Mexican immigrants and how the real racists are on the left. The usual provocations,\u00a0a sort of Canal Street knockoff of Milo Yiannopoulos\u2019 queeny hate-ogre routine. The thrust of Wintrich\u2019s message: Be white, be proud.\nBut there was a more subtle message, as well: that his \u201calt-lite\u201d cabal of race-baiting pro-Trump social media influencers, which also includes Yiannopoulos, Laura Loomer, Mike Cernovich and Jack Posobiec, were nothing like the\u00a0Richard Spencer\u00a0hatemongers of the world; that their less-brutish white identity politics had nothing to do with intolerance.\u00a0\n\u201cThey\u2019ll call you racists, and Nazis, but none of it is true,\u201d he planned to tell his audience, according to a transcript of his speech.\nBut right there, kitted out in MAGA gear and standing by Wintrich\u2019s side, was Cipolla, a racist who has marched alongside neo-Nazis. His social media is littered with\u00a0racist,\u00a0hateful\u00a0remarks and photos of him hanging out with\u00a0David Duke\u00a0and\u00a0other prominent white supremacists, as well as\u00a0Donald Trump-connected ratfuckers, such as Chuck Johnson and James O\u2019Keefe, who consort with white supremacists.\u00a0Cipolla\u2019s presence alongside Wintrich is good evidence there is little that\u2019s \u201clite\u201d about Wintrich\u2019s \u201calt.\u201d\nA onetime member of the Proud Boys, a thuggish crew of extremists that attracts\u00a0racists and fascists,\u00a0Cipolla has been\u00a0arrested\u00a0multiple\u00a0times, once for punching a 19-year-old woman.\nAnd when a woman in the audience at UConn snatched Wintrich\u2019s notes off his lectern, prompting Wintrich to chase after her and grab her \u201cin a violent manner,\u201d according to a police report, Cipolla flung himself into the scuffle.\nIt was over quickly. The police frog-walked Wintrich out of the room and arrested him on a breach of peace charge. Cipolla got a police escort outside.\nThis may seem like a minor episode in the grand scheme of intolerance \u2015 our Republican president is, after all, regularly tweeting the same racist propaganda as white supremacists these days. But we should note that since fans of Richard Spencer sieg-heiled in public last year, members of the \u201calt-lite\u201d have taken great pains to distance themselves \u2015 at least in the public eye \u2015 from their overtly racist fellow travelers in the \u201calt-right\u201d white supremacist movement. Their goal is to scuttle closer to mainstream conservatism by pushing off from harder-edged extremists such as Spencer, which Wintrich made clear in the transcript of his speech:\nImagine this shameless contortion of logic being dropped on a bunch of impressionable young conservatives.\u00a0The \u201cIt\u2019s OK to be White\u201d meme\u00a0was cooked up in the neo-Nazi bowels of 4chan as a way to troll liberals\u00a0into protesting whiteness and generating far-right propaganda. White supremacists embraced it. So did Wintrich.\u00a0His entire speech was inspired by the meme and designed to normalize it.\nAnd yet he wanted to use Spencer as a foil. It has become increasingly obvious to anyone paying attention \u2015\u00a0such as the protesters in the UConn audience chanting \u201cGo home, Nazis!\u201d \u2015 that\u00a0birds of a feather tend to alight on the same fasces and that the alt-light continues to provide not only a cover for the extremists of the far-right but also a conduit for their political energy into the mainstream.\nCipolla was a heaving,\u00a0blundering example of it.\nIn June, this racist roustabout, while working in conjunction with Loomer, Posobiec and other alt-lite activists, was arrested for rushing the stage during a performance of Shakespeare\u2019s\u00a0\u201cJulius Caesar\u201d\u00a0in Central Park while screaming, \u201cGoebbels would be proud!\u201d\nA week later, Wintrich appeared at a \u201cRally Against Political Violence\u201d in front of the White House that began with a Trump supporter shouting, \u201cIt\u2019s time to put George Soros in the gas chamber!\u201d One of the groups in charge of security for the event was the 211 Bootboys, a neo-Nazi skinhead crew. Joining Wintrich at the event were Loomer, Posobiec, Cernovich and members of the Proud Boys, one of whom delivered a hateful speech about the media that had an audience member bellowing about \u201cviolent communist scum!\u201d\nIt\u2019s unclear if Cipolla made that event, but he did show up in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Aug. 12 for a frenzy of white supremacist violence in the streets that left a counter-protester dead. These were the sort of conservatives the UConn College Republicans chose to host on campus.\n\u201cWe brought Mr. Wintrich to campus to have a conversation about identity politics, and we understand that this is a controversial issue,\u201d the group said in a statement Thursday. \u201cHowever, we firmly believe in our Constitutional right to invite him to speak on campus and present his point of view.\u201d\nAfter Wintrich was released by the police in Connecticut on Tuesday night, having posed in his tuxedo for a smirking mug shot, Cipolla posted a Facebook live video of his associate, asking him what it had been like in the clink.\n\u201cIt\u2019s basically another Shoah,\u201d Cipolla joked. \u201cThis is basically the equivalent of the Holocaust, right?\u201d\nWintrich didn\u2019t know how to respond. But Mike Peinovich, a neo-Nazi who runs an alt-right podcast platform and is a close friend of Cipolla\u2019s, did. Peinovich was watching the video online and chimed in through the Facebook comments: \u201cIt\u2019s not like the holocaust because it actually happened.\u201d\nCipolla burst out laughing. \u201cMike, I love you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou win best comment of the night.\u201d\nHere they were, just a bunch of pals on the Young Republican club circuit making Holocaust jokes. Just some \u201cIt\u2019s OK to be white\u201d bros having a lark while making racism fun again. If it sometimes seems as if there isn\u2019t much distance between the alt-lite and outright white supremacy, that\u2019s because there isn\u2019t.", "date": "\n12/02/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/white-supremacist-lucian-wintrich-sal-cipolla_n_5a232e8ae4b0a02abe919853", "tags": "arrested roadie speech heavily uconn white house got \u201d racist cipolla \u2015 alt-lite police reporter wintrich"}
