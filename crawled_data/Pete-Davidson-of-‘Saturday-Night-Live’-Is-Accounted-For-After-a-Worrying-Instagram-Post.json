All I\u2019ve ever tried to do was help people. Just remember I told you so.\u201d The note ended with a heart emoji.\nHis post was immediately followed by an outpouring of support on social media, and his name started trending on Twitter.\nThe episode apparently started on social media after the musician Kanye West responded to a comment on Twitter from Ms. Grande calling for people to stop paying attention to \u201cgrown men arguing online\u201d and to new music being released by herself and Miley Cyrus.\nMs. Grande was apparently referring to an online feud between Mr. West and the rapper Drake. Mr. West responded that \u201cPeople will no longer take mental health for a joke\u201d and discussed his own mental health.\nMs. Grande apologized on Twitter for being \u201cinsensitive\u201d and Mr. Davidson supported Mr. West on Instagram.\n\u201cNo one should ever point fingers at you for your bravery in speaking about mental health,\u201d Mr. Davidson wrote. \u201cI\u2019m seriously disgusted.\u201d Shortly after, Mr. Davidson posted the alarming remarks that led others to worry about his well-being.\nMs. Grande, in a comment later deleted from Twitter, seemed alarmed and apologized for \u201ca dumb joke.\u201d\nIn another comment on Twitter that was also deleted, Ms. Grande added: \u201cI\u2019m downstairs and I\u2019m not going anywhere if you need anyone or anything. I know u have everyone u need and that\u2019s not me, but i\u2019m here too.\u201d\nMr. Davidson has been open about his struggles with borderline personality disorder.\n\u201cI\u2019ve spoken about B.P.D. and being suicidal publicly only in the hopes that it will help bring awareness and help kids like myself who don\u2019t want to be on this earth,\u201d he wrote on Instagram this month. \u201cNo matter how hard the internet or anyone tries to make me kill myself. I won\u2019t. I\u2019m upset I even have to say this.\u201d\nIn praising Mr. West, Mr. Davidson touched on what it takes to talk openly about mental health. \u201cI can\u2019t explain to you enough how difficult and scary it is to be honest about stuff like this,\u201d he wrote.\nThe rapper and actress Nicki Minaj wrote on Twitter: \u201cGo & give this man some love. My God,\u201d after Mr. Davidson\u2019s worrisome comments on Instagram, and then criticized the public for being \u201cinsensitive\u201d and \u201cflippant about mental illness.\u201d\nMr. Davidson started dating Ms. Grande in May, and they were engaged in June. He described to Variety how he proposed to her in bed.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to do something corny,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were in bed hanging, after watching a movie. I was like, \u2018Will you marry me?\u2019 It was really dope.\u201d\nIn September, Ms. Grande\u2019s former boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller, died from what appeared to be a drug overdose. The next month, Ms. Grande and Mr. Davidson ended their relationship.\nMr. Davidson is best known for his work on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d His father, Scott, a firefighter, was killed during the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Mr. Davidson was 7 at the time of his father\u2019s death and has his badge number tattooed on his left arm.\nMr. Davidson\u2019s mother told The New York Times in 2015 that her son was \u201csad\u201d while growing up. He attended three high schools because of problems getting along with other students but started doing stand-up comedy when he was 16.\nMr. Davidson, who has Crohn\u2019s disease, went to rehab in 2016 but later announced that he had a borderline personality disorder that left him \u201cdepressed all the time,\u201d he said on \u201cWTF,\u201d a podcast with Marc Maron, in 2017.\nHe said the death of his father had affected him greatly.\n\u201cMy big thing is trust,\u201d Mr. Davidson told Mr. Maron. \u201cOne day he was here and the next day he was gone.\u201d\n[If you are having thoughts of suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 (TALK).
