{"title": "Trump's Administration Wants Democrats To Fund Wall Mexico Is Supposed To Pay For", "content": "Senior White House officials on Sunday urged Democrats not to shut the government down over partial funding for President Donald Trump\u2019s proposal to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. Lost in their appeals, however, was the president\u2019s oft-repeated promise that Mexico would pay for it.\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine the Democrats would shut down the government over an objection to building a down payment on a wall that can end the lawlessness,\u201d Attorney General Jeff Sessions said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to get it paid for one way or the other,\u201d he added, hinting the U.S. could secure the funds later through trade negotiations. \u201cI don\u2019t expect the Mexican government to appropriate money for it. But there are ways that we can deal with our trade situation to create the revenue for it.\u201d\nTrump vowed that Mexico would pay for a \u201cbig, beautiful wall\u201d throughout the campaign trail. His supporters loved the line so much that they screamed \u201cMexico\u201d whenever he spoke about the project, which is estimated to cost at least\u00a0$21.6 billion.\nAppearing on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday, Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.) said he believed lawmakers would come to an agreement and avert a shutdown before funding to the government runs out next week. But he noted the matter was complicated somewhat by Trump\u2019s insistence that Mexico \u2015 not U.S. taxpayers \u2015 would foot the tab for the wall.\n\u201cI think there\u2019s still question marks about, wait a minute, this is a guy that said Mexicans are going to pay for it, and now it\u2019s going on a spending bill borne by the U.S. taxpayer,\u201d he said on CNN. \u201cSo I think there\u2019s going to be debate on it. But I think ultimately it\u2019s still a Republican priority and I don\u2019t think [the government] is going to get shut down over it.\u201d\nSen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) also recalled the president\u2019s campaign rhetoric in a separate interview on the same program.\n\u201cThis was a promise made by the president during his campaign. And don\u2019t you remember, he said the Mexicans were going to pay for it? Now we know it\u2019s going to cost $20 billion to $70 billion for this wall,\u201d he said.\nTrump addressed the budget brinksmanship in a Sunday morning tweet, promising Mexico would pay for the wall \u201ceventually\u201d and \u201cin some form.\u201d He also threatened to cut off key Obamacare subsidies unless Democrats agree to fund the wall he said Mexico would pay for.", "date": "\n04/23/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/border-wall-mexico_n_58fcb22ce4b018a9ce5bfd6b?l1", "tags": "administration going wall supposed democrats wants trump \u201d fund mexico pay government said"}
