{"title": "Sean Bean's Role In 'Game Of Thrones' Was Much Bigger Than You Thought", "content": "Season 1 of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d may seem like a distant memory, but let\u2019s get real: The North always remembers.\u00a0\nIf there\u2019s one character who\u2019s truly unforgettable, it\u2019s Eddard \u201cNed\u201d Stark, played by the actor who dies in everything, Sean Bean. Ned was billed as the lead of the HBO series, but\u00a0(spoiler alert!)\u00a0was killed off in Episode 9, \u201cBaelor,\u201d proving early on that \u201cGoT\u201d wasn\u2019t against executing its stars\u00a0\u2015\u00a0or any other cast member for that matter.\nStill, despite getting his head chopped off, Ned has remained the heart of the HBO show, posthumously guiding the Stark children throughout their own journeys to the Iron Throne.\u00a0\nWhen asked about Ned\u2019s impact years after his untimely/tragic/why-God-why departure, Bean told HuffPost, \u201cHe was such a fantastic character to play. He was one of the very few good men with principles and morals and values in the whole thing, because everybody\u2019s backstabbing and poisonous people.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHe was an anchor to a lot of people, and of goodness ...\u00a0I was just glad to play Ned Stark. I\u2019m very proud of it,\u201d\u00a0Bean said.\nSomething else Bean is proud of:\u00a0He says was his voice that determined\u00a0the dialect of the North. That\u2019s right, Bean said that showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss suggested the Yorkshire, England, native keep his own accent when playing the Stark patriarch.\n\u201cWe were doing the [pilot] read-through and the producers and the writers said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you just keep your own accent?\u2019 And I said, \u2018All right! Good for me,\u2019\u201d he said on Build Series, laughing. \u201cBut then, everybody else had to do the same accent\u00a0[as] me from the Stark family. So I established the way we speak.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThat set the tone for I guess the next seven seasons,\u201d he later told HuffPost. \u201cThey all had to talk like me.\u201d\nCasting director Nina Gold confirmed Bean\u2019s pivotal role in an interview with HuffPost last year. \u201cSean Bean is a delight and an amazing actor,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter casting him, we wanted to make people seem like they were a part of his family and part of the same anthropology. It set the tone for the casting of the rest of the North.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI guess we were trying to make it have a homogeneous feel,\u201d she added, referencing the Northern English accent. \u201d[We]\u00a0were trying to find something to bring them together \u2026 but also, it makes sense because it\u2019s the North!\u201d\nOf course, Michelle Fairley (Catelyn), Richard Madden (Robb), Kit Harington (Jon Snow), Sophie Turner (Sansa), Maisie Williams (Arya), Isaac Hempstead Wright (Bran) and Art Parkinson (Rickon) were all cast as members of the Stark clan. Each attempted to bring Bean\u2019s accent to life in their own way on screen, some better than others.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u201cA lot of British actors are magnificent at accents, but Kit and Maisie, who are both from the West country, and Richard, who is Scottish, all particularly nailed what we were looking for,\u201d Gold said.\nAs for whether Bean helped any of his young co-stars with the Northern accent, he told HuffPost, \u201cNow and again, yeah, but not often. Kids are quick at picking things up; the older guys could use help a bit.\u201d\n\u201cBut no, it\u2019s quite a well-known accent and it\u2019s not that hard,\u201d he said.\nBean\u2019s accent eventually even led producers to cast Bella Ramsey, aka everyone\u2019s favorite speech-giving spitfire from Bear Island, Lady Mormont.\n\u201cThe kind of convention that we\u2019ve sort of got going on is the people in the North have a Northern accent. We then went with it for the whole of the North\u00a0... so we were looking for Northern kids,\u201d she said,\u00a0\u201cWe met her at [The Television Workshop in Nottingham] ... and it was just great.\u201d\nApparently, Ramsey didn\u2019t even have to audition too many times because, at that point, producers knew what they were looking for.\nAnd, it was her.\u00a0\nBean hasn\u2019t kept up with the show as much as he would\u2019ve liked to. (\u201cI think I got me head chopped off in the ninth episode, I stopped watching it then,\u201d he said, laughing.) But he\u2019s glad to be a small part of Westeros and eager to see Ned\u2019s kin ultimately reign supreme.\n\u201cI think Jon Snow would be a good choice [for the Iron Throne],\u201d he said.\u00a0\nWatch Sean Bean\u2019s full Build Series interview below.\u00a0\nBill Bradley contributed reporting.", "date": "\n03/17/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/sean-bean-game-of-thrones_n_5aa6b621e4b087e5aaeca1fc", "tags": "much thought \u201c stark sean ned northern bean bigger thrones role north accent huffpost"}
