{"title": "A Scholar Is Back Home and Defiant in Hungary", "content": "BUDAPEST \u2014 \u201cDuring my years abroad, both in the U.S. and Australia, I always said that I liked living there, but that I want to be buried in my home, in Hungary,\u201d said the philosopher Agnes Heller, who at the age of 84 lives in Budapest, still writing \u2014 in three languages \u2014 and lecturing.\nIt is generous of Ms. Heller to preserve affection for a homeland that has been so unkind to her. She was born and raised in the city\u2019s Jewish ghetto in the volatile political climate of 1930s Central Europe. Ms. Heller and her mother narrowly escaped deportation to Auschwitz; her father perished there.\nIn the postwar years she studied philosophy under the Hungarian Marxist Georg Lukacs, and later became part of the so-called Budapest School around him \u2014 radical thinkers calling on Hegel and the humanist works of early Marx to reinvigorate contemporary Marxism.\nIn the aftermath of the 1956 revolution in Hungary, Ms. Heller, though a socialist and Communist Party member, was\u00a0warned by police about '\u2018anti-state activity,\u201d\u00a0and banned from working at a university.\nIn 1977 she emigrated to Australia as a political exile. During the 1980s, Ms. Heller rethought her political views, becoming highly critical of orthodox Marxism. She subsequently assumed the Hannah Arendt visiting professorship of philosophy and political science at the New School for Social Research, in New York, where she lived and taught political theory for 25 years.\nBut it\u2019s more than sentimentality that compels Ms. Heller to stay in Hungary, where she is professor emeritus at Budapest\u2019s esteemed Eotvos Lorand University. Her experience and knowledge are needed here, she says, particularly now.\nAnd peers, like the political scientist Andras Bozoki, professor at the Central European University, are grateful to have her: \u201cShe\u2019s a model of a freethinker and free citizen. Agnes Heller\u2019s a globally known scholar who believes it is the role of intellectuals to engage civically,\u201d he said.\nIn recent years, Ms. Heller has become a leading figure speaking out against the policies of Prime Minister Viktor Orban and his party, Fidesz.\nMr. Orban has been criticized by the European Union and human rights groups for limiting freedoms of expression, among other controversial political moves. In higher education, critics say, Mr. Orban has gradually stripped away universities\u2019 independence. His administration, for example, has required that the government itself appoint university rectors.\nThe atmosphere, many say, is one of fear and uncertainty. Pressure has been brought to bear on the country\u2019s liberal-minded intellectuals, those defiant enough to protest \u2014 among them Agnes Heller. In the international news media as well as the handful of independent outlets still in business in Hungary, Ms. Heller decries Hungary\u2019s authoritarian drift and underscores the responsibility of its scholars, as well as its ordinary citizens, to resist.\nThe government says these charges are nonsense. \u201cAgnes Heller is doing what she always does: complaining loudly abroad whenever there\u2019s an anti-communist government in power in Budapest,\u201d said Andras Doncsev, deputy minister at the Ministry of Human Resources, which is responsible for education. Hungarian universities are world-renowned and enjoy full academic freedom, he added.\nMs. Heller\u2019s words earned her the wrath of the Orban administration as early as 2011, when she and a handful of other academics were accused by a government commission of embezzling research funds earmarked for translations. In early 2012 the charges were dropped for lack of evidence.\n\u201cThere was nothing to the charges at all,\u201d said Anna Gacs, an associate professor of media studies at Eotvos Lorand University and a founder of the University Lecturers\u2019 Network, a faculty group formed to protect the public universities from government interference. \u201cIt was the regime\u2019s first attempt to control the critical intelligentsia.\u201d\nSpeaking with a reporter in her small apartment, high above the Danube River, Ms. Heller said the government \u201cknew there was nothing\u201d in the charges. \u201cBut this is their strategy,\u201d she said. \u201cThey make these kinds of accusations, spread them all over their loyal media outlets, and thus blacken the names of their opponents. By targeting liberals, they blacken the name of liberalism itself. \u2018Liberal\u2019 here is a dirtier word than \u2018Nazi\u2019 or \u2018communist.\u201d\u2019\nThis year Ms. Heller and several other Jewish faculty members were the targets of anti-Semitic acts. Her office door and others at Eotvos Lorand in central Budapest were plastered with bumper stickers that read: \u201cJews, the university is ours, not yours!\u201d\nThe incident made headlines, not least because Ms. Heller is a Holocaust survivor and the Orban government has been accused of anti-Semitic tendencies.\nThere was no investigation into the incident, but most observers assume it was done by far-right student groups, which are prominent on Hungarian campuses. Surveys show that a third of Hungary\u2019s students support the far right.\nOther faculty members agree that the public universities are in a deep crisis. Funding has been cut by 50 percent over the past four years, and the Education Ministry, not the universities themselves, now determine which faculty members stay on beyond the retirement age of 62. The climate makes some faculty members reluctant to speak out against government policies.\n\u201cMany younger colleagues censor themselves,\u201d said Daniel Deak, a professor of tax law at Corvinus University of Budapest. \u201cThey just keep quiet and do their research in the library. They\u2019re scared that they\u2019ll lose what they\u2019ve got.\u201d\nAccording to Ms. Gacs, the public universities are being starved of funds, pared down in size, and intimidated, while the Orban government has invested millions of dollars to build up research institutes and colleges to train civil servants. \u201cThe idea is to create a faithful body of technocrats to run the Fidesz state for years to come,\u201d she said. \u201cThe bigger project is to replace the current elites with their own elites.\u201d\nAndras Doncsev, the government official, says the charge is untrue. \u201cThey can\u2019t give you one example of this happening,\u201d he says.\nGiven the environment she returned to, does any of this make Agnes Heller regret returning to Hungary? Or might an end to the Orban administration be in sight with national elections scheduled for early next year? No on both accounts, she says. There have been flashes of protest by students, Ms. Heller notes, but they petered out quickly. There\u2019s still no unified opposition in the country.\nNevertheless, even four more years of Viktor Orban and Fidesz, says the octogenarian, will not force her to flee Hungary again. Agnes Heller is home to stay.", "date": "Dec. 8, 2013", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/09/world/europe/a-scholar-is-back-home-and-defiant-in-hungary.html", "tags": "scholar \u201c hungary home orban back university defiant heller budapest ms. government"}
