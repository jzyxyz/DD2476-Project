{"title": "How 'Game Of Thrones' Got Us To Cheer For The Guy Who Sleeps With His Sister", "content": "With his dirty golden hair hanging in front of his bloodied face, a sly Jaime Lannister stares up at his captor, Catelyn Stark, who is distraught after learning her husband lost his head at the command of petulant king Joffrey Baratheon. Catelyn is infuriated by Jaime\u2019s arrogance, his sexual and religious insults. She threatens to cut off his own head and send it to his sister, Queen Regent Cersei.\nBut first, she grills him about the accident that defined the tension between the Starks and the Lannisters on \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d\u00a0\nFrom the Season 1 finale, \u201cFire and Blood\u201d:\u00a0\nJaime Lannister was decidedly not a virtuous man at the start of \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d\u00a0which makes his current journey to fight the good fight \u2014 against the army of the dead in the North \u2014 all the more momentous.\nGlaring steely eyed at Catelyn Stark (Michelle Fairley) at the end of Season 1, we see Jaime for what he clearly is: a bad guy. He\u2019s the notorious Kingslayer who swore to protect the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, the Mad King Aerys Targaryen, before literally stabbing him in the back. He\u2019s Cersei Lannister\u2019s (Lena Headey) twin brother, secret lover and biological father to all three of her children with Robert Baratheon (Mark Addy): Joffrey (Jack Gleeson), Myrcella (Nell Tiger Free) and Tommen (Dean-Charles Chapman). And yes, he\u2019s the guy who kicked off the show\u2019s initial conflict, leaving sweet Bran Stark (Isaac Hempstead Wright) paralyzed after he pushed the 10-year-old from a Winterfell tower in order to protect his and Cersei\u2019s incestuous affair.\u00a0\nJaime\u2019s evolution is powered by one driving force: his love of Cersei. As disturbing as it is, audiences have weirdly come to accept Jaime\u2019s intimate relationship with his sister, understanding that he\u2019s fueled by his desire to not only be with Cersei but help their family maintain power in Westeros.\u00a0\n\u201c[Jaime pushes Bran out of the window] because he understands if this kid tells anyone what he just saw it\u2019ll mean the death of the woman he loves, their three children and himself. And that\u2019s not good,\u201d Nikolaj Coster Waldau, who plays Jaime, told HuffPost during a Build Series segment in 2017. \u201cI never saw him as the villain [...] I see him as being a bit of an arrogant prick in the whole beginning, but I try to understand, \u2018Why is he being so annoying?\u2019 Well, it\u2019s because everyone\u2019s like, \u2018The Kingslayer! The Kingslayer!\u2019\u201d\n\u00a0\nWe first get a glimpse of the more empathetic side of Jaime in Season 3 when he\u2019s on the road with Brienne of Tarth (Gwendoline Christie), who\u2019s ordered by Catelyn Stark\u00a0to return her hostage to King\u2019s Landing in exchange for the safety of her daughters, Sansa (Sophie Turner) and Arya (Maisie Williams). Although he\u2019s his typical prickish self toward the beginning of their journey, Jaime comes to like Brienne and actually protects her once they\u2019re captured by Roose Bolton\u2019s (Michael McElhatton) bannermen. His allegiance, however, comes at a price as Bolton hunter Locke (Noah Taylor) gets sick of Jaime\u2019s sense of superiority and spontaneously decides to chop off the knight\u2019s right hand. That was a turning point for Jaime.\u00a0\n\u201cLosing the hand meant he had to redefine who he is and who he was,\u201d Coster-Waldau said. \u201cThat [change] was so forced upon him.\u201d\u00a0\nThe vulnerable state he finds himself in leads to one of the most genuine moments we see of Jaime in the series. In Season 3, Episode 5, \u201cKissed By Fire,\u201d he and Brienne bathe in a large tub at Harrenhal, and Jaime spews his truth about what happened when he killed Aerys during the Sack of King\u2019s Landing. As Jaime\u2019s father, Tywin (Charles Dance), and the Lannister army were invading the city after Robert\u2019s Rebellion, Aerys ordered Jaime to kill Tywin and for the pyromancer to burn King\u2019s Landing and its inhabitants to the ground. Jaime couldn\u2019t let that happen, so he drove his sword into Aerys\u2019 back and slit his throat before he could use wildfire to \u201cburn them all.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cTell me, if your precious Renly [Baratheon] commanded you to kill your own father and stand by while thousands of men, women, and children burned alive, would you have done it? Would you have kept your oath then?\u201d Jaime asks Brienne, who questions why he didn\u2019t tell Ned Stark the truth after he discovered what happened in the throne room.\n\u201cStark? You think the honorable Ned Stark wanted to hear my side? He judged me guilty the moment he set eyes on me,\u201d Jaime says. \u201cBy what right does the wolf judge the lion? By what right?\u201d\u00a0\nAs his ruthless father demanded of him, \u201clion\u201d Jaime \u201cdoesn\u2019t concern himself with the opinion of sheep.\u201d He tries not to let the Kingslayer pseudonym affect him; he affectionately dotes on Cersei like no one\u2019s watching. He\u2019s developed a detached air to deal with how he\u2019s perceived, but, in Jaime\u2019s mind, he\u2019s much more than the backstabber \u201cthe sheep\u201d claim him to be.\nThe Lannister, for all the wrong he\u2019s done, is not a bad person, and we see that through his time with Brienne, which Coster-Waldau said had \u201ca huge impact\u201d on the honorable man Jaime would become.\u00a0\nFirst, though, he had to take his newfound sensitivity back to King\u2019s Landing, where Cersei was attempting to plot and scheme her way out of a Tyrell invasion of sorts.\n\u00a0\nIn Season 4, \ufeffCersei detests Jaime \u2015 not only for his stumpy arm and mangled looks, but because he \u201cleft\u201d her to handle Lannister business on her own. Cersei, as per usual, is only concerned with her own personal gains, rarely acknowledging Jaime\u2019s unfortunate predicaments. (Clearly he wanted to be captured, have his hand cut off and fight a bear, right?)\nBut, after spending three more seasons at her beck and call \u2015 in which he watches his son Joffrey die, releases his \u201ctreasonous\u201d brother Tyrion (Peter Dinklage) from prison, and grieves his father Tywin and other children Myrcella and Tommen \u2015 Jaime finally begins to understand that as good of a mother as she is, Cersei is a deceitful woman hellbent on winning the game of thrones, at whatever cost.\u00a0\nIn the finale of Season 7, \u201cThe Dragon and the Wolf,\u201d Cersei and her council meet with Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) and Jon Snow (Kit Harington)\u00a0in the dragon pit to hatch a plan to take down the true villain: the Night King and his army of wights. After seeing a wight in the flesh, Cersei agrees to a truce to help defeat the dead under one condition: Jon Snow stays neutral, pledging his loyalty to neither her or House Targaryen. Well, dear old Jon knows nothing, of course, and foolishly tells Cersei he\u2019s already bent the knee to Dany. This does not please her Grace.\n\u201cThe dead will come North first, enjoy dealing with them. We will deal with whatever is left of you,\u201d she tells them before storming off.\u00a0\nDespite his feelings toward Cersei, Tyrion decides to chat with his arch-nemesis sister to try and convince her to help the good of mankind. And although we don\u2019t see how their conversation pans out (thanks to\u00a0sneaky writers David Benioff and D.B. Weiss), Cersei decides to retract her previous statement and march her armies North to fight in the Great War.\nOr so she says.\nWhen Jaime meets with her to discuss their expedition to Winterfell, she calls him \u201cthe stupidest Lannister,\u201d and makes it clear she has no intention of helping the King in the North.\u00a0\nShe goes on to reveal her and Euron Greyjoy\u2019s (Pilou Asb\u00e6k) cunning plan to stay in the South. They will buy the Golden Company army in Essos and bring them to the capital to fight for her reign.\u00a0\nRepulsed and fed up with Cersei\u2019s lies, Jaime tells her he will fulfill his oath to ride North to Jon and Dany, and leave her to fend for herself. She threatens his life, commanding The Mountain to take out his sword.\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe you,\u201d Jaime says in disgust, and confidently walks away.\n\u201cWhen he gets to that point, it really was, \u2018Finally!\u2019\u201d Coster-Waldau told HuffPost\u00a0after the scene aired. \u201cFinally he says no. Finally he stands up to her. It was such a brutal scene because they\u2019re playing two different games: Cersei\u2019s playing the game of thrones and Jaime\u2019s playing the honest game of survival, and trying to accommodate both his sister and his brother.\u201d\nLeaving Cersei to fight alongside their traitor brother\u2019s dragon queen proves Jaime might just be as honorable as the show\u2019s moral compass, Ned Stark (Sean Bean), the man who seemingly judged \u201cThe Kingslayer\u201d too quickly.\u00a0Like Ned\u2019s bastard son\u00a0nephew Jon Snow Aegon Targaryen, Jaime has decided \u201cto fight for the side that fights for the living,\u201d a true test of his nobility and personal growth.\u00a0\nIn Season 8, Jaime will join forces with \u201cthe good guys\u201d and is set to be reunited with not only Tyrion and Brienne of Tarth, but the boy he pushed out the window in the pilot episode of \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d Little does he know though, Bran is no longer an avid climber but the Three-Eyed Raven, which should make for an interesting get-together.\u00a0\n\u201cI would love Jaime to meet Bran Stark,\u201d Coster-Waldau told HuffPost. \u201cIf nothing else just to say, \u2018Sorry, kid.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d Season 8 premieres April 14 on HBO.\u00a0", "date": "\n03/23/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jaime-lannister-game-of-thrones_n_5c912255e4b04ed2c1af540e", "tags": "cersei us game stark sleeps season cheer \u201d got lannister guy king thrones fight jaime sister"}
