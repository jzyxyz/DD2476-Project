{"title": "Seven surprising numbers from China-Africa trade", "content": "China has become Africa's largest trade partner, and has just promised an impressive $60bn (\u00a340bn) in assistance and loans to boost development of the continent.\nYet the relationship is not simply about new roads, mines and military power. Traders from across Africa now live and work in China, while tens of thousands of Chinese nationals have moved in the opposite direction. \nMany different facets of life in Africa have been affected by the Chinese influence - here's a look at some of the more surprising transactions:\nIn 2014, tiny Benin was the continent's biggest importer of wigs and false beards from China. It purchased Chinese hair pieces worth $411m.\nA hefty three million kg (472,400 stone) were taken to Benin, with many of those wigs then whisking their way to neighbouring Nigeria. \nSouth Africa was the continent's biggest importer of Chinese-made male underpants.\nOf the 18,747,003 pants imported by South Africa in 2014, 16,612,590 were Chinese - that's a whopping 88% of South Africa's imported pants. \nMauritius was Africa's largest importer of Chinese soy sauce last year, spending $438,929. \nHowever surprising sales don't just flow one way. Mauritius sent back 5,735 reptiles to China to a value of $90,000.\nKenya was Africa's biggest importer of plastic Chinese toilet seats in 2014, spending $8,197,499 on the lavatorial thrones. \nIn Nigeria, China has not only been buying its oil, but also keeping Nigeria's teeth clean.\nNigerian traders were the continent's biggest purchasers of toothbrushes from China last year, spending a cool $9,372,920 on 159 million items - roughly one for each Nigerian. \nChina has also been keeping Africa moving. In 2014, Togolese traders spent $193,818,756 on Chinese motorcycles.\nOnly Nigeria imported more, spending a whopping $450,012,993. \nGuinea was Africa's largest primate exporter in 2014, sending 17 live animals, weighing a total of 340kg (750lb), to China last year.\nSource: COMTRADE, UN \nMore on China in Africa:\nThe BBC is running a special series about China's role in Africa.", "date": "5 December 2015", "href": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-35007900", "tags": "largest china-africa china seven surprising traders numbers continent nigeria chinese trade africa importer biggest spending"}
