{"title": "Republican Rep- Steve King Retweets A Known White Supremacist On Twitter--- Again", "content": "For the second time in three months, Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) has promoted the views of a prominent white nationalist on Twitter.\u00a0\nIn a tweet posted early Wednesday afternoon, King quote-tweeted Lana Lokteff, a host for the white nationalist media outfit Red Ice, which the Southern Poverty Law Center has designated\u00a0a hate group.\u00a0\nIn his tweet, King argued\u00a0incorrectly that Nazis were part of a left-wing movement.\nThe word \u201cNazi,\u201d King wrote, \u201cis injected into Leftist talking points because the worn out & exhausted \u2018racist\u2019 is over used & applied to everyone who lacks melanin & who fail to virtue signal at the requisite frequency & decibels. But...Nazis were socialists & Leftists are socialists.\u201d\nThe tweet was identical to one King\u00a0posted on Sept. 9. This time, though, he linked to the tweet from Lokteff.\nAs documented by the site Right Wing Watch, Lokteff is an out-and-proud white nationalist who has talked openly of wanting a white ethnostate. She has said America \u201ccan never, ever be too white,\u201d and has argued that interracial relationships are \u201cmore devious than blatant in-your-face mass murdering.\u201d\u00a0\nShe is also explicitly anti-Semitic. \u201c#SeinfeldTaughtMe why people don\u2019t like Jews,\u201d she once tweeted.\u00a0\nIn 2016, Lokteff appeared on the podcast of former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke. \u201cThanks for listening!\u201d she tweeted afterward. \u201cNothing like coffee and David Duke to start your day.\u201d\nLokteff runs the white nationalist propaganda site Red Ice TV with her husband, Henrik Palmgren. The site has\u00a0posted\u00a0videos of flattering interviews with prominent white supremacists, including \u201calt-right\u201d figurehead Richard Spencer.\nKing\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday about whether he condones Lokteff\u2019s views, whether he\u2019s concerned his views align with those of white nationalists, or whether a U.S. congressman should be amplifying the message of someone like Lokteff.\nIn June, King promoted an anti-immigrant tweet from Mark Collett, a well-known British neo-Nazi. He then refused to delete the tweet or apologize.\nKing has deep ties to white nationalists and other extremist far-right figures in the U.S. and Europe. He also has a long, long history of making racist and bigoted comments.\nHuffPost argued in July that King himself should be labeled a white supremacist. When HuffPost asked the congressman on Capitol Hill whether he considers himself a white supremacist, he refused to answer the question.\nMeanwhile, the Republican Party has let King\u2019s bigotry go unpunished. The Republican National Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment Wednesday about whether they condone King promoting known white nationalists on Twitter.\nKing, an eight-term congressman, faces a re-election battle this November against Democrat J.D. Scholten.\nAmerica does not do a good job of tracking incidents of hate and bias. We need your help to create a database of such incidents across the country, so we all know what\u2019s going on.\u00a0Tell us your story.", "date": "\n09/12/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/steve-king-tweets-white-nationalist-lana-lokteff_n_5b995994e4b0511db3e8a0fc", "tags": "steve retweets lokteff twitter tweet views white \u201d whether -- republican supremacist king rep- nationalist posted known"}
