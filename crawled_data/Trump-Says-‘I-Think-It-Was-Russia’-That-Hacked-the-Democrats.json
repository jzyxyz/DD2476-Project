Trump concedes Russia probably meddled in the election.\n\u25a0 Mr. Trump\u2019s evocation of Nazi persecution prompts a fierce blowback.\n\u25a0 Representative Mark Sanford, a Republican, to the president-elect: I too want to see your tax returns.\n\u25a0 Mr. Trump renews vow to empower the federal government to negotiate drug prices, breaking with Republican orthodoxy.\nPresident-elect Trump conceded for the first time that Russia was behind the hacking of Democrats during the presidential election, saying at a news conference that, \u201cI think it was Russia\u201d \u2014 though a few minutes later he said perhaps it was another country.\nBut he vigorously denied the swirl of allegations about his behavior that was published online Tuesday, calling it \u201cfake news\u201d and praising Russian President Vladimir V. Putin for saying it was false. \u201cI respected the fact that he said that,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all fake news. Its phony stuff. It didn\u2019t happen,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIt was gotten by opponents of ours. It was a group of opponents that got together. Sick people and they got together and put that crap together.\u201d\nAsked what Mr. Trump would say to Mr. Putin about the election hacking, he responded, \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t have done it. I don\u2019t believe he will be doing it more.\u201d\nMr. Trump disputed the allegations that he was involved in salacious behavior in a Russian hotel room, saying that he is always highly aware that there are \u201ccameras in the strangest places\u201d in hotel rooms when he travels around the world.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t see them and you won\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cYou better be careful or you will be watching yourself on nightly televisions.\u201d\nPresident-elect Trump should have known that comparing himself to a victim of Nazi persecution would not go over well \u2014 and it didn\u2019t.\nOn Wednesday morning, amid a furor over the publishing of an unsubstantiated, explosive dossier, Mr. Trump posted on Twitter:\nIn 140 characters, he compared American intelligence agencies to Nazis, called himself a target, and asked whether his travails were comparable to those of the victims of Adolf Hitler.\nThe response was swift from organizations that combat anti-Semitism and guard the memories of Nazi victims.\n\u201cIt is a despicable insult to Holocaust survivors around the world, and to the nation he is about to lead, that Donald Trump compares America to Nazi Germany. The president-elect has denigrated our nation and its commitment to freedom on the eve of his inauguration. He must retract his tweet and apologize to survivors and to our entire nation,\u201d said Steven Goldstein, executive director of The Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect, the American wing of an international organization that fights discrimination in Anne Frank\u2019s name.\nThe Anti-Defamation League also joined the denunciations.\nThe blowback was a reminder to Mr. Trump of what is known as Godwin\u2019s Law: \u201cAs an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Hitler approaches.\u201d And once it happens, the conversation generally stops.\nPresident-elect Trump angrily accused CNN of being \u201cfake news\u201d as he repeatedly refused to take a question from Jim Acosta, the network\u2019s reporter at his news conference.\nIn a testy exchange between the two men, Mr. Acosta repeatedly asked for a question in order to respond to the president-elect\u2019s accusations against the network. Mr. Trump angrily said, \u201cI am not going to give you a question. You are fake news.\u201d\nMr. Trump also lashed out at Buzzfeed News, which published a document of allegations Tuesday night, calling the news organization a \u201cfailing pile of garbage\u201d and saying that \u201cI think they are going to suffer the consequences.\u201d\nDuring his news conference, the president-elect was pressed to release his tax returns to prove that his businesses have no relationships with Russian oligarchs. Mr. Trump refused, once again, and then made a novel claim: \u201cYou know, the only one that cares about my tax returns are the reporters, O.K.?\u201d\nFact check: False.\nSource: Representative Mark Sanford, Republican of South Carolina. When he was that state\u2019s governor, Mr. Sanford famously disappeared to Argentina to pursue an extramarital affair under the guise of hiking the Appalachian Trail.\nWhen Mr. Sanford gets to lecture on ethics, well, that\u2019s notable.\nThe Trump Organization may not be looking for new foreign deals, but that doesn\u2019t mean big businesses overseas aren\u2019t looking to hook up with the president-elect\u2019s family business.\nAt his news conference on Wednesday, Mr. Trump said that Damac, a large developer in the United Arab Emirates, had recently tried to reach a $2 billion deal with the Trump Organization, which declined the offer.\nNiall McLoughlin, a senior vice president at Damac, confirmed Mr. Trump\u2019s account, saying in an email that \u201cthe discussions took place as stated in the media briefing.\u201d\n\u201cBut the proposals were declined. These proposals were for a variety of different properties deals,\u201d he added, without elaborating.\nDamac is a major developer in the Persian Gulf region. It is building the Trump International Golf Club Dubai and an adjacent luxury housing development, which does not bear the Trump name. The project has been in the works since 2013, with the Trump Organization managing the golf club after it opens, scheduled for February.\nDamac has some ties to the Emirati government \u2014 any big business in the Emirates does \u2014 but its founder, Hussain Sajwani, is not part of the social and political elite. His father owned a small shop in Dubai\u2019s market that sold midrange watches and pens, and the family was solidly middle class, and even today Mr. Sajwani remains an outsider among the tightly knit old families that control the Emirates.\nIn many ways, Mr. Sajwani is a lot like Mr. Trump. He has a flair for showmanship \u2014 he once tried to attract buyers for a new development by offering a free Bentley with every apartment \u2014 and his best customers tend to be rich outsiders who are trying to buy their way into the elite, like moneyed Iranians and well-off Indians.\nAdmittedly, the president-elect was a little vague, but for the nation\u2019s pharmaceutical giants, he was clear enough: The drug industry, Mr. Trump said, is \u201cgetting away with murder.\u201d\n\u201cPharma has a lot of lobbies and a lot of lobbyists and a lot of power, and there\u2019s very little bidding on drugs. We\u2019re the largest buyer of drugs in the world and yet we don\u2019t bid properly and we\u2019re going to start bidding and we\u2019re going to save billions of dollars over a period of time,\u201d he said.\nDuring the early months of the campaign, before less substantive issues swamped the debate, Mr. Trump broke with his party and said the federal government should be using its purchasing power to negotiate drug prices for Medicare and Medicaid.\nDemocrats have been pressing that for years \u2014 it was in an early version of the Affordable Care Act. But Republicans, backed by the drug industry, have adamantly opposed, and thwarted, every effort to give the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that authority.\nBut the Republican Party of Mr. Trump has found a way to change sides on a lot of issues.\nDavid J. Shulkin, the current undersecretary at the Department of Veterans Affairs and the head of its sprawling hospital system, will become the secretary of the beleaguered agency, President-elect Trump said Wednesday.\nMr. Trump made the comments during his first full news conference since being elected president two months ago and just nine days before moving into the White House. He answered questions from some of the more than 250 reporters crammed into the lobby of Trump Tower in Manhattan.\nEven as Mr. Trump took questions in New York, his nominee for secretary of state was being grilled on Capitol Hill by lawmakers about his connections to Russia. And news continued to swirl regarding allegations about Mr. Trump presented by intelligence officials to the president-elect.\nFrom the moment the unsubstantiated but explosive intelligence report hit the internet, the questions arose: When and what would Mr. Trump post on Twitter?\nThe initial volley came shortly after 8:15 p.m. on Tuesday.\nThen on Wednesday morning, the president-elect decided to press his war with the intelligence agencies he will soon oversee \u2014 and rely on for pressing matters of state.\nHe also seconded reports from Moscow that Russian government officials deny having any compromising material on Mr. Trump.\nIt is true that the Kremlin denied holding any material that it could use to blackmail the incoming president. Dmitri S. Peskov, a spokesman for President Vladimir V. Putin, told reporters: \u201cThe Kremlin has no compromising dossier on Trump. Such information isn\u2019t consistent with reality and is nothing but an absolute fantasy.\u201d\nNeedless to say, Russian officials would not tell the world they had such information if it was meant for blackmail. Also needless to say, an election won with nearly three million votes fewer than your opponent was not won easily.\nA Quinnipiac University poll on Tuesday put Mr. Trump\u2019s approval rating at 37 percent.\nIt should be an interesting news conference at Trump Tower on Wednesday morning.\nQuestions continue to swirl about the validity of the dossier saying that Russian intelligence has deeply compromising material on the man who is about to be commander in chief. But its wide circulation has already had an impact.\nOn Tuesday night, Representative Brad Sherman, Democrat of California, asked President Obama for a classified briefing on \u201cthe compromising information Russia has obtained regarding President-elect Donald Trump.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, the Democratic National Committee\u2019s interim chairwoman, Donna Brazile, pressed for a bipartisan, independent investigation.\nSenator Richard Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat, said he too wants a special investigation into the dossier.", "date": "Jan. 11, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/11/us/politics/donald-trump-press-conference.html", "tags": "think \u2018 mr. saying news democrats conference \u201d trump says hacked russia \u2014 president-elect"}
