{"title": "After Hints of a Presidential Run, Bloomberg Switches to Democrat", "content": "Michael R. Bloomberg, the Democrat-turned-Republican-turned-independent, says he is returning to his roots: He has re-registered as a Democrat \u2014 an initial but essential step toward a possible run for president in 2020 as a Democrat.\nMr. Bloomberg made the announcement in simultaneous social media postings on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, which showed the left-handed 76-year-old filing out his registration paperwork (and also, incidentally, the absence of his middle \u201cR\u201d initial).\n\u201cAt key points in U.S. history, one of the two parties has served as a bulwark against those who threaten our Constitution,\u201d Mr. Bloomberg wrote, adding later, \u201cWe need Democrats to provide the checks and balance our nation so badly needs.\u201d\nMr. Bloomberg had abandoned the Democratic Party to launch his political career in 2001 and win the mayoralty in New York City as a Republican. But he noted on Wednesday that he had been a Democrat \u201cfor most of my life.\u201d\nHe ended nearly two decades of estrangement, inspired by what he said was the call of history and the need for an opposition party to provide on a check on President Trump.\nMr. Bloomberg\u2019s centrist politics are very likely to create some friction with the current activist class of the Democratic Party, including his views on Wall Street regulations and the stop-and-frisk police tactics he embraced as mayor. He also would be 78 on Election Day in 2020 \u2014 older than anyone elected president.\nWhile it is still unclear whether Democrats will welcome him into what could be a historically expansive primary field in 2020, the party leadership has very much embraced him in the 2018 congressional midterms, as he has pledged to spend $100 million to help Democrats win both the House ($80 million) and the Senate ($20 million).\nThe spending is expected to make him the single biggest political contributor in the country in 2018. \u201cHis name is synonymous with excellence,\u201d the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, gushed earlier this year.\nMr. Bloomberg has done more than just give. Last week, he traveled to Florida to campaign for the Democratic nominee for governor there, Andrew Gillum, at a Jewish center in Pembroke Pines. He donated to Mr. Gillum; his anti-gun group, Everytown for Gun Safety, also donated; and he hosted a fund-raiser, too.\nThis Tuesday, back in New York, Mr. Bloomberg hosted a fund-raiser for Phil Bredesen, the former Democratic governor of Tennessee and current candidate for United States Senate.\nMr. Bloomberg is not solely backing Democrats this year; in June, he held a fund-raiser for Representative Peter King, Republican of New York, with whom he worked closely following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.\nStill, his re-registration as a Democrat is not a shock.\nMr. Bloomberg spoke at the 2016 Democratic convention in favor of Hillary Clinton (\u201cThe richest thing about Donald Trump is his hypocrisy,\u201d Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire, said then.). And he has begun flirting with the presidency himself in recent months, he told The New York Times in September. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say I\u2019m with the Democratic Party on everything, but I don\u2019t see how you could possibly run as a Republican. So if you ran, yeah, you\u2019d have to run as a Democrat.\u201d\nIn that interview, Mr. Bloomberg hinted that he might formally register as a Democrat, saying he would \u201clook at it\u201d but had no imminent plans.\n\u201cI think at the moment, there\u2019s no reason to do anything,\u201d Mr. Bloomberg said then, of changing his registration. \u201cBut if I think \u2014 if I wanted to change parties and I thought it sent the right message, I would do it.\u201d\nMr. Bloomberg\u2019s registration announcement comes ahead of New York\u2019s deadline later this week and after the deadline has passed in more than a dozen states in recent days.", "date": "Oct. 10, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/10/nyregion/michael-bloomberg-democrat-president.html", "tags": "york \u201c democrats party run new switches democratic bloomberg democrat hints presidential"}
