In another, Mr. Trump said, \u201cThe Intelligence people seem to be extremely passive and naive when it comes to the dangers of Iran. They are wrong!\u201d\nNormally, the \u201cWorldwide Threat Assessment\u201d is an annual bureaucratic exercise, a dispassionate survey of the threats facing the United States \u2014 some longstanding, some new \u2014 that the White House accepts without much comment.\nMr. Trump, however, treated the report, presented at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Tuesday by Dan Coats, the director of National Intelligence; Gina Haspel, the C.I.A. director; and other officials appointed by the president, as a scorecard on his foreign policy, and something close to an affront.\nHis outburst laid bare the rift between the bureaucracy and a president who came into office determined to challenge decades of foreign policy orthodoxy. It also revealed Mr. Trump\u2019s deep frustration at what he believes is the lack of credit he has received for his efforts, be it his diplomacy with North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, or his more confrontational policy toward Iran.\nIt thrust the spy agencies into an extremely awkward position, putting them at odds with the commander in chief and sowing doubts among Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters about whether the agencies can be trusted \u2014 the kind of public battering that has tarnished the credibility of the F.B.I.\nAbove all, it revealed the president\u2019s tendency to view everything through the prism of his own achievements.\nTo be sure, the agencies did contradict Mr. Trump\u2019s assessment of two of the major threats: North Korea, they said, was unlikely to give up its nuclear arsenal, even after Mr. Trump\u2019s diplomacy with Mr. Kim. Iran, which Mr. Trump has painted as an implacable enemy, is not taking steps to manufacture a nuclear bomb, they said.\nThe agencies took a far more cautious view of the threat posed by the Islamic State, which Mr. Trump said on Wednesday \u201cwill soon be destroyed, unthinkable two years ago.\u201d And they said that Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policies and \u201cunilateralism\u201d had strained the United States\u2019 alliances.\nLawmakers and former intelligence officials condemned Mr. Trump\u2019s attack because they said that it corrupted the intelligence process and suggested that he would disregard the warnings in the threat assessment.\n\u201cThis is a consequence of narcissism, but it is a strong and inappropriate public political pressure to get the intelligence community leadership aligned with his political goals,\u201d said Douglas H. Wise, a career C.I.A. official and former top deputy at the Defense Intelligence Agency.\n\u201cThe existential danger to the nation is when the policymaker corrupts the role of the intelligence agencies, which is to provide unbiased and apolitical intelligence to inform policy,\u201d Mr. Wise said.\nRepresentative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said it was dangerous for the president to dismiss the findings of his own intelligence agencies.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to ignore that information, then you\u2019re going to make poor decisions,\u201d Mr. Schiff said in an interview on Wednesday. He added, \u201cIt means the country is fundamentally less safe.\u201d\nIn a letter to Mr. Coats, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, characterized Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism as \u201cextraordinarily inappropriate\u201d and urged Mr. Coats to stage the equivalent of an intervention with the president to educate him about the importance of these assessments.\nRepresentative Mike Gallagher, Republican of Wisconsin, defended the agencies, saying, \u201cThey are doing a very difficult job and they are actually trying to advance the president\u2019s priorities.\u201d\nMr. Trump\u2019s defenders, however, said the threat assessment reflected the views of the national security establishment \u2014 a culture that the president took office vowing to disrupt. They said the president would be vindicated for many of his foreign policy initiatives.\n\u201cThe establishment is wrong and he\u2019s right,\u201d said Stephen K. Bannon, who served as Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist until last year. \u201cHe\u2019s made NATO more robust. In the Middle East, we\u2019re much more engaged. The destruction of the underlying physical caliphate of ISIS is a fact.\u201d\nJack Keane, a retired four-star Army general, said the nature of intelligence assessments was not to give credit to foreign policy achievements but to dwell on the risks and shortfalls.\n\u201cThe president wants credit for moving away from an appeasement policy toward a more confrontational approach toward Iran,\u201d Mr. Keane said. \u201cThis president has approached the Iranians more than any other president, and he wants to get credit for it.\u201d\nIn his tweets on Wednesday, Mr. Trump said negotiations with the Taliban to wind down the war in Afghanistan were \u201cproceeding well.\u201d He said the relationship with North Korea was the \u201cbest it has ever been with U.S. No testing, getting remains, hostages returned. Decent chance of Denuclearization \u2026\u201d\nUnder his predecessor, President Barack Obama, he said, the \u201crelationship was horrendous and very bad things were about to happen.\u201d\nMr. Trump\u2019s dismissal of the threat report led some critics to ask where the president gets his foreign policy advice.\nThe answer, say people who have worked with him, is a flickering parade of talking heads on Fox \u2014 hard-line foreign policy experts, retired generals and longtime on-air personalities \u2014 who praise his actions, savage his critics and validate his \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach to the world.\nMembers of this circle rotate in and out of the White House. John R. Bolton, a longtime Fox commentator who served in the George W. Bush administration, is now Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, and has been influential in hardening his strategy toward Iran.\nSebastian Gorka, a little-known academic who made his name in conservative circles with his writings about Islamic radicalism, left a job at the White House after he could not obtain a security clearance, and now stoutly defends the president\u2019s policies on Fox.\nLou Dobbs, a longtime anchor for Fox Business Network, has helped shape Mr. Trump\u2019s view on China and trade over decades. Michael Pillsbury, the hawkish China scholar has become influential since Mr. Trump became president.\nThat is not to say that these outsiders invariably back Mr. Trump. Mr. Keane, one of the most prominent outside voices, went on Fox to condemn Mr. Trump\u2019s abrupt decision in December to pull troops out of Syria as a \u201chuge strategic mistake,\u201d which he would \u201ccome to regret.\u201d\nThe president later agreed to a more gradual drawdown \u2014 a reversal that Mr. Keane\u2019s criticism may have helped bring about, according to people who know Mr. Trump, since his set the tone for an almost unanimously negative reaction on the part of Republicans.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a danger in overstating my role, or what people would perceive as the importance of it,\u201d Mr. Keane said. \u201cThe president largely gets very good advice from his national security team, and they are his primary advisers.\u201d\nBut the president\u2019s vitriolic reaction to the threat assessment left some critics skeptical.\n\u201cWe have no idea who is setting his agenda,\u201d Mr. Schiff said. \u201cWho is whispering in his ear about a supposed threat from Montenegro,\u201d he added, as an example. \u201cHe\u2019s clearly not getting\u201d the threat information from the intelligence agencies.", "date": "Jan. 30, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/30/us/politics/trump-intelligence-agencies.html", "tags": "pushes \u2018 intelligence officials \u201c president back trump naive agencies threat \u2014 angry"}
