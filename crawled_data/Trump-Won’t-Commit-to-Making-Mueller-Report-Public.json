{"title": "Trump Won\u2019t Commit to Making Mueller Report Public", "content": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. \u2014 President Trump would not commit in an interview aired Sunday to making public the results of the special counsel\u2019s investigation into Russia\u2019s ties to his campaign, adding that it was time to \u201cget rid\u201d of the inquiry.\nIn the interview on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d Mr. Trump reiterated his belief that the attorney general would determine whether the public would see the results of the inquiry by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. But he would not say whether he would be comfortable with the results being made public.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d the president said. \u201cIt depends. I have no idea what it\u2019s going to say.\u201d\nThe law does not require the Justice Department to release a report, and Mr. Mueller has been silent on the issue. Last month, Trump advisers were pleased that William P. Barr, Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for attorney general, opened the door to the possibility that the special counsel\u2019s report could be shielded from the public during a Senate confirmation hearing.\nMr. Trump\u2019s wide-ranging interview with Margaret Brennan, the show\u2019s host, was conducted days after the acting attorney general, Matthew G. Whitaker, said the investigation  was nearing its end, and amid stagnant negotiations with Democrats over Mr. Trump\u2019s demand for a border wall. Mr. Trump indicated at various points in the interview that he would use the power of his office to solve that matter and others facing his presidency.\nAmong those matters, the president appeared to suggest, are national security and the military. He called the use of military force against Venezuela \u201can option.\u201d And he indicated that he would like to keep troops in Iraq \u2014 a striking departure from his push to withdraw from Afghanistan and Syria \u2014 to \u201ckeep an eye\u201d on Iran.\n\u201cIt\u2019s perfectly situated for looking at all over different parts of the troubled Middle East rather than pulling up,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep watching and we\u2019re going to keep seeing and if there\u2019s trouble, if somebody is looking to do nuclear weapons or other things, we\u2019re going to know it before they do.\u201d\nOn the border wall fight, the president reiterated his belief that \u201cwe have now set the table\u201d to take action after a short-term deal to fund part of the government \u2014 a deal struck to end the longest government shutdown in history \u2014 expires on Feb. 15. In an interview with The New York Times on Thursday, Mr. Trump suggested that he had successfully made the case to Americans that the problem at the border was enough to constitute declaring a national emergency, and that Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, was doing a \u201cdisservice\u201d to the country \u2014 both points he again made on Sunday.\n\u201cPeople that didn\u2019t have any idea,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have a clue as to what was happening. They now know exactly what\u2019s happening.\u201d\nMr. Trump is expected to make immigration a cornerstone of his State of the Union speech, which is scheduled for Tuesday. In the interview with CBS, Mr. Trump once again accused Democrats, in particular Ms. Pelosi, of ignoring urgent problems at the border, which included human trafficking and what Mr. Trump called an \u201cinvasion\u201d of human traffickers into the country.\nThough Mr. Trump seems intent on ignoring congressional negotiations, lawmakers insisted on Sunday that they were still trying. Senator Richard C. Shelby, the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee and a member of the committee working to reach a deal, admitted that it was too early to say whether the negotiations could be successful.\n\u201cI think that the president is dead set on keeping his campaign promise,\u201d Mr. Shelby, Republican of Alabama, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d He acknowledged that Mr. Trump probably had some legal merits for declaring a national emergency over the border wall, but he pleaded for the committee to be allowed to do its work.\n\u201cIf people leave us alone,\u201d Mr. Shelby added, \u201cwe\u2019ll get this done by Wednesday night.\u201d\nHe said that the committee had invited experts with knowledge of the southwestern border to testify this week on exactly what is needed for border security. Mr. Shelby expressed optimism that hearing from those experts \u201ccould move us off of\u201d the semantic debate over a wall or fencing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a question of how do we get off the politics and on to the substance,\u201d he said.\nOther members of the bipartisan committee \u2014 Representative Henry Cuellar, Democrat of Texas, and Senator John Hoeven, Republican of North Dakota \u2014 doubled down on their respective party\u2019s positions on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d Mr. Cuellar, who represents parts of the border, dismissed the president\u2019s reasoning for the wall as built on \u201ca false premise.\u201d\nIn the CBS interview, Mr. Trump fought back against criticism of his wall and other policies. He responded to warnings that his administration was risking a resurgence of terrorist groups by promising the rapid withdrawal of troops from Syria and Afghanistan by saying that he \u201cran against 17 Republicans\u201d and won.\n\u201cI\u2019ll leave intelligence there,\u201d Mr. Trump said, \u201cand if I see nests forming, I\u2019ll do something about it.\u201d\nLast week, Mr. Trump showed similar defiance in suggesting that his intelligence chiefs \u201cgo back to school\u201d for issuing a threat assessment saying that North Korea was unlikely to give up its nuclear program and that Iran is not, for now, taking steps necessary to make a bomb.\nMr. Trump said that he would ultimately rely on his own counsel if he disagreed with intelligence assessments.\nThe president also indicated that the power of his affectionate letter writing with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, might persuade Mr. Kim to drop his nuclear plans. Mr. Trump has at least six letters from Mr. Kim that he enjoys sharing with people who visit him in the Oval Office.\n\u201cWe have had tremendous correspondence that some people have seen and can\u2019t even believe it,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cNow that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to make a deal. But certainly I think we have a very good chance of making a deal.\u201d\nOther leaders did not receive such praise. Mr. Trump said that he had declined a meeting with Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, the embattled president of Venezuela, days after the Trump administration said it recognized Juan Guaid\u00f3, the 35-year-old opposition figure, as the country\u2019s rightful leader.\n\u201cI decided at the time, \u2018no,\u2019 because so many really horrible things have been happening in Venezuela when you look at that country,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\nWith his cabinet in flux, Mr. Trump dismissed as \u201cfake news\u201d the reports that Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, had asked Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state and his most visible emissary in negotiations with North Korea, to consider leaving to run for a Senate seat in Kansas.\nMr. Pompeo confirmed that discussion over a week ago. The secretary of state said that he had appreciated the call, but that he had a \u201cvery full plate.\u201d\nThe CBS interview was broadcast during the president\u2019s first visit in months to Mar-a-Lago, his Florida estate, where he spent Saturday golfing with Tiger Woods and Jack Nicklaus. On Sunday, the president hit the golf course again amid planning for his annual Super Bowl party.\nThe president told CBS that he loved to watch football, but that he would not encourage his youngest son, Barron, 12, to participate in such a dangerous sport.", "date": "Feb. 3, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/us/politics/trump-interview-mueller.html", "tags": "public report commit making border president \u201d trump interview \u2014 mueller"}
