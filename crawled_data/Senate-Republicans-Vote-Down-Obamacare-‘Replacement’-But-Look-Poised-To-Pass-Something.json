Senate Republican leaders kept their members, Senate Democrats, and the public in the dark about their plan to vote on a smaller version of repeal for weeks. There\u2019s little reason to believe Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) isn\u2019t working on alternative legislation now in case the skinny repeal runs into trouble \u2015 or, conversely, if he sensed that a bigger deal were within reach.\nAsked why Republicans were doing this smaller bill Tuesday, Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) made it clear that leadership was largely making up the plan as they go.\n\u201cWho knows what the final bill will look like?\u201d Cornyn said Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019d be happy to have a comprehensive bill that 50-plus senators agree to, but if we can\u2019t, then the idea would be to come up with a core of pieces that 50 of us agree on so we can get to a conference.\u201d\nFor now, that larger deal looks unlikely.\nWith nine Republicans going on record against the BCRA, McConnell would have his work cut out for him in passing a similar piece of legislation, as senators are now on the record against the bill.\u00a0(Technically, senators were rejecting a procedural motion for the legislation, but this vote largely served as a proxy for a vote on the bill.)\nBut the smaller repeal looks like it\u2019s in decent shape. Fifty Republicans voted to open debate Tuesday, with only Collins and Murkowski voting no. And even though there are a number of Republicans who could potentially vote against the skinny repeal \u2015 Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) among the most likely \u2015 lawmakers have largely tipped their hand. They have shown willingness to cave to leadership. They don\u2019t seem that troubled by the process or the legislation that leadership is using to strike at the Affordable Care Act. And their complaints of a bad process or a bad bill are just that: complaints.\nAmong the senators who voted for BCRA was Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who spent part of his day delivering an impassioned floor speech decrying the process and the legislation that he voted for later in the evening. Johnson, who withheld his vote earlier Tuesday during the motion to proceed until he had a 10-minute conversation on the floor with McConnell, also ended up voting for the BCRA, as did Capito, who has made her qualms about Medicaid cuts well-known, saying last week that she didn\u2019t \u201ccome to Washington to hurt people.\u201d\nBut a Congressional Budget Office analysis of BCRA said it would do just that, leading to 22 million fewer people with insurance and raising prices substantially on older, low-income Americans.\nThe skinny repeal, while a less robust piece of legislation, would still manage to do much of the same. The CBO has previously said that similar legislation would lead to 15 million fewer people with health insurance and 20 percent premium increases. The legislation would, in short, produce the sort of death spiral that Republicans accuse Obamacare of producing. \nAsked about the potential for that death spiral, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) suggested the skinny repeal bill would not be the final product. \u201cThis is a legislative process,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a journey. And we\u2019re not there yet.\u201d\nCruz added late Tuesday night that the replacement plan he voted for would likely be \u201cthe contours\u201d of a final bill.\nNo one seems to think the skinny repeal will be the bill that President Donald Trump signs. House conservatives suggested Tuesday that they would not simply take this smaller bill. House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) told HuffPost there was \u201cno appetite\u201d to take the Senate bill if it were \u201cjust an expanded executive order.\u201d And Freedom Caucus member Rep. Raul Labrador (R-Idaho) said he would have \u201cno problem\u201d voting no on a bill if it were just a repeal of the individual and employer mandate.\n\u201cThis is our one chance to actually repeal Obamacare and to give states flexibility,\u201d Labrador said, suggesting he wants to see something that would cut at least some of the Obamacare regulations and decrease premiums.\nThat standard could be difficult for both chambers to agree on, particularly if House conservatives draw a hard line on cutting regulations that would undermine protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\nThe measure Tuesday night needed 60 votes because of the inclusion of two amendments: an unscored proposal from Rob Portman (R-Ohio) that would offer some assistance to people who lose Medicaid coverage, and the so-called Cruz amendment \u2015 which would allow insurers to offer plans that don\u2019t comply with Obamacare regulations as long as they offer at least one plan that does. The Senate parliamentarian has not ruled whether Cruz\u2019s proposal\u00a0conforms with rules for the budget reconciliation process,\u00a0which allows the chamber to fast-track certain measures.\u00a0If the parliamentarian finds that Cruz\u2019s amendment should be subject to 60 votes, it could be difficult for a final piece of legislation to address the issue as well. \nAnd if House conservatives are making it a prerequisite that the conference bill eliminate at least some of those regulations that ensure people with pre-existing conditions are charged the same amount as healthy people, they could be setting up the whole process for failure.\nBut if the Republican process has proved anything, it\u2019s that almost every Republican will bend on his or her stated principles to check the box of repealing Obamacare.", "date": "\n07/25/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/senate-republicans-bcra-vote_n_5977f7dfe4b0a8a40e83a2d4", "tags": "\u2018 something plan obamacare poised repeal \u201d pass \u2015 senate look replacement republicans bill tuesday legislation vote"}
