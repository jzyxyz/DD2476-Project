But as Sunday\u2019s vote approaches, the man who has transformed Turkey over 15 years in power appears increasingly vulnerable.\nThe question will be, just how vulnerable is he?\nThe vote will be watched far beyond Turkey\u2019s borders for what it will decide about the direction this country of 80 million \u2014 whether it continues down the path of populist authoritarianism with Mr. Erdogan, or takes a turn for democratic change.\nA skillful politician with a fervent support base, Mr. Erdogan still leads in the polls. But dissatisfaction over a sudden downturn in the economy is spreading. So is alarm over Mr. Erdogan\u2019s increasing authoritarianism, which, if he wins, will be given even freer rein under a newly strengthened presidency.\n\u201cA strong Turkey needs a strong leader,\u201d Mr. Erdogan bellowed to the crowd of several hundred thousand in his final Istanbul campaign rally last Sunday. \u201cMay God let us continue on this path by becoming more powerful.\u201d\nWhether Mr. Erdogan can secure the outright victory he wants by gaining 50 percent of the vote \u2014 avoiding a runoff \u2014 may depend on how deeply the wariness and unhappiness with his rule have unsettled his core supporters.\nIn particular, the collapse of agriculture, a plunge in the value of the lira and a sudden rise in food prices may deliver Mr. Erdogan a shock at the polls, opposition party workers say. Much of the president\u2019s base of support has been among conservative rural people.\n\u201cI am hesitant this time,\u201d said Bulut, who sells fresh juice from a cart near Istanbul\u2019s ferry docks. He gave only his first name for fear of repercussions. He said he had voted for the governing party over the past 16 years but complained angrily about the deteriorating economy.\n\u201cNo jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cI am here for 22 years, it became worse gradually. Our money has no value anymore.\u201d\nIf 7 to 8 percent of formerly loyal voters abandon the president\u2019s Justice and Development Party, or A.K.P., the governing party will lose, said Ozer Sencar, who runs the independent Metropoll polling agency.\nThere are already signs of defections, Mr. Sencar said, noting that some of them had voted against Mr. Erdogan in last year\u2019s referendum to expand the powers of the presidency, which passed only narrowly.\n\u201cThis is the group that will determine the fate of the election,\u201d he said.\nMost of the group are conservative Islamists among the Kurds who are disappointed that Mr. Erdogan failed to keep his promise to make peace with Kurdish separatists, Mr. Sencar said.\nFour opposition parties \u2014 the Republican People\u2019s Party, the Good Party, the Felicity Party and the tiny Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party \u2014 have formed an alliance to maximize their assault against Mr. Erdogan.\nBut the state of emergency Mr. Erdogan snapped in place almost two years ago after a failed coup has allowed the government to tilt the playing field greatly in its favor.\nMr. Erdogan has used the extra powers to jail political opponents, including nine Kurdish members of Parliament and dozens of Kurdish party officials, as well as 70,000 students and activists and tens of thousands of members of the military and public employees. Demonstrations are banned, and access to national television is tightly controlled.\nThe Kurdish candidate, Selahattin Demirtas, has campaigned from prison, where he is being held while he awaits trial on terrorism charges. He relies on a team of lawyers to relay his messages on social media. And last week he was permitted to record a single campaign speech inside prison that was aired on the state-run Turkish Radio and Television, or T.R.T.\nA former interior minister, Meral Aksener, is barred from using large rally sites and has barely been seen on television \u2014 most of which is controlled by the government or its allies.\nMuharrem Ince, the closest challenger to Mr. Erdogan, fares slightly better, appearing on some television channels but still barred from T.R.T.\nOver the past six weeks, Mr. Erdogan has enjoyed 181 hours of national television airtime, while Mr. Ince was allowed 15 hours, Ms. Aksener three hours and the rest one hour or less, according to the Supreme Board of Radio and Television.\nIt is Mr. Ince who has been Mr. Erdogan\u2019s main target, smeared by \u201cfake news\u201d campaigns by government supporters. But he has parried the attacks with humor and a hopeful message and has started drawing crowds to match those of Mr. Erdogan.\nYet there is no doubt that Mr. Erdogan\u2019s persona has dominated the campaign. His campaign posters are the largest and most numerous. His rallies are broadcast live on virtually every television channel. And his voice is heard everywhere.\nHe also controls all the levers of power, rules by decree under a state of emergency and can count on a tame judiciary and presidential guard.\nGovernment employees are ordered to attend Mr. Erdogan\u2019s rallies \u2014 and give him their vote if they value their jobs \u2014 opposition campaigners say \u2014 and journalists in media outlets, which are mostly owned by allies of the president, are given guidelines on what to write.\nBut signs of disaffection are visible. Supporters declare their love for Mr. Erdogan, yet many start leaving his rallies halfway through his long-winded speeches.\nThe former Islamist allies who have turned against the president are the most outspoken.\nTemel Karamollaoglu, leader of the small Felicity Party, criticizes Mr. Erdogan for betraying his religion by letting corruption and injustice invade his government. He is set to draw away 2 to 3 percent of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s conservative religious following.\n\u201cYou cannot have one man with all the power,\u201d Mr. Karamollaoglu told supporters in the town of Sakarya. \u201cYou cannot expect any justice from judges receiving orders from the top.\u201d\nThe party has produced some of the most surprising campaign ads, passed around on social media. One shows workers in a tailor\u2019s shop packing away plaid jackets similar to those that Mr. Erdogan wears. The sign on the door says: \u201cBoss gone crazy. Closeout sale.\u201d\nThe Republican People\u2019s Party, which has a long tradition of secularism, has added several Islamists to its party list to build an Islamist alternative to Mr. Erdogan\u2019s A.K.P.\nOne of the co-founders of the A.K.P. with Mr. Erdogan, a former deputy prime minister, Abdullatif Sener, is running for Parliament on the Republican People\u2019s Party list in the conservative city of Konya.\nHe stunned villagers during meetings in a farming district with strident criticism of Mr. Erdogan, the likes of which is never heard in the mainstream media.\n\u201cIf you cannot buy food and clothes for yourself, it means the economy is not growing,\u201d he told them, disputing government claims of 7 percent growth.\nHe accused Mr. Erdogan of neglecting Turkey\u2019s agriculture to make money on deals importing foodstuffs.\n\u201cYou want to farm your land but this government made us completely dependent on imports,\u201d he said. \u201cAll they think of is ransacking the country.\u201d\nA shopkeeper in the village of Cayhan told Mr. Sener that villagers were too scared to tell the truth but that almost all were going to switch their support away from Mr. Erdogan.\n\u201cSomething is going to happen,\u201d said Bulent Ecevit Tatlidil, a member of the executive bureau of the Republican People\u2019s Party who is from the farming district.\nOutrage over a sudden paucity of onions has even hit the main television news. Ms. Aksener accused Mr. Erdogan of treason for his neglect of agriculture.\n\u201cOne million are jobless,\u201d she told a rally in Istanbul. \u201cThe fields are empty, livestock is finished. To wipe out Turkish agriculture is treason.\u201d\nYet the opposition is also bracing for every manner of obstruction, including fraud and violence.\nMr. Sener\u2019s campaign office in Konya was attacked last week by members of the local youth wing of the A.K.P., who slashed a poster of Mr. Sener and smashed campaign cars.\nThe election observer mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe has noted in a preliminary report that the president enjoys favorable conditions, while other parties face obstructions to campaigning and a pervasive atmosphere of fear in the Kurdish areas of the southeast.\nThe opposition parties are fielding 100,000 volunteers to observe voting in every polling station but face multiple challenges as regulations have been changed to allow unstamped ballots to be counted, and some polling stations have been closed and voting moved to other locations.\nIn the southeast, violence has already broken out; an election dispute led to the deaths of three people in the town of Suruc. Some analysts speculated that the clash was about how to fix the vote for Mr. Erdogan.\nThe Kurdish vote, which represents about 10 percent, is particularly important for both sides.\nIf Mr. Demirtas\u2019s People\u2019s Democratic Party, or H.D.P., can pass a 10 percent threshold, it could rob Mr. Erdogan of a majority in Parliament.\nIf the party wins less than 10 percent of the vote, its votes will be distributed to the other parties, which would most likely help Mr. Erdogan secure a majority.\nIn a sign of how crucial the Kurdish vote is, Mr. Erdogan urged party members to make sure the H.D.P. vote remained below 10 percent.\nIn a video posted inadvertently over social media last week, he told a closed gathering of regional party members to watch H.D.P. voters.\nThen he asked his supporters to \u201cmark their opponents,\u201d suggesting that by doing so they would be doing \u201ca special job that I believe may bring us a very different result.\u201d", "date": "June 22, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/22/world/europe/turkey-elections-erdogan-opposition.html", "tags": "turkey percent cracks opposition grip voters party television iron \u201d tests democratic \u2014 vote erdogan"}
