{"title": "Potential Conflicts Around the Globe for Trump, the Businessman President", "content": "MANILA \u2014 On Thanksgiving Day, a Philippine developer named Jose E. B. Antonio hosted a company anniversary bash at one of Manila\u2019s poshest hotels. He had much to be thankful for.\nIn October, he had quietly been named a special envoy to the United States by the Philippine president, Rodrigo Duterte. Mr. Antonio was nearly finished building a $150 million tower in Manila\u2019s financial district \u2014 a 57-story symbol of affluence and capitalism, which bluntly promotes itself with the slogan \u201cLive Above the Rest.\u201d And now his partner on the project, Donald J. Trump, had just been elected president of the United States.\nAfter the election, Mr. Antonio flew to New York for a private meeting at Trump Tower with the president-elect\u2019s children, who have been involved in the Manila project from the beginning, as have Mr. Antonio\u2019s children. The Trumps and Antonios have other ventures in the works, including Trump-branded resorts in the Philippines, Mr. Antonio\u2019s son Robbie Antonio said.\n\u201cWe will continue to give you products that you can enjoy and be proud of,\u201d the elder Mr. Antonio, one of the richest men in the Philippines, told the 500 friends, employees and customers gathered for his star-studded celebration in Manila.\nMr. Antonio\u2019s combination of jobs \u2014 he is a business partner with Mr. Trump, while also representing the Philippines in its relationship with the United States and the president-elect \u2014 is hardly inconsequential, given some of the weighty issues on the diplomatic table.\nAmong them, Mr. Duterte has urged \u201ca separation\u201d from the United States and has called for American troops to exit the country in two years\u2019 time. His antidrug crusade has resulted in the summary killings of thousands of suspected criminals without trial, prompting criticism from the Obama administration.\nSituations like these are already leading some former government officials from both parties to ask if America\u2019s reaction to events around the world could potentially be shaded, if only slightly, by the Trump family\u2019s financial ties with foreign players. They worry, too, that in some countries those connections could compromise American efforts to criticize the corrupt intermingling of state power with vast business enterprises controlled by the political elite.\n\u201cIt is uncharted territory, really in the history of the republic, as we have never had a president with such an empire both in the United States and overseas,\u201d said Michael J. Green, who served on the National Security Council in the administration of George W. Bush, and before that at the Defense Department.\nThe globe is dotted with such potential conflicts. Mr. Trump\u2019s companies have business operations in at least 20 countries, with a particular focus on the developing world, including outposts in nations like India, Indonesia and Uruguay, according to a New York Times analysis of his presidential campaign financial disclosures. What\u2019s more, the true extent of Mr. Trump\u2019s global financial entanglements is unclear, since he has refused to release his tax returns and has not made public a list of his lenders.\nIn an interview with The Times on Tuesday, Mr. Trump boasted again about the global reach of his business \u2014 and his family\u2019s ability to keep it running after he takes office.\n\u201cI\u2019ve built a very great company and it\u2019s a big company and it\u2019s all over the world,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding later: \u201cI don\u2019t care about my company. It doesn\u2019t matter. My kids run it.\u201d\nIn a written statement, his spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, said Mr. Trump and his family were committed to addressing any issues related to his financial holdings.\n\u201cVetting of various structures and immediate transfer of the business remains a top priority for both President-elect Trump, his adult children and his executives,\u201d she said.\nBut a review by The Times of these business dealings identified a menu of the kinds of complications that could create a running source of controversy for Mr. Trump, as well as tensions between his priorities as president and the needs and objectives of his companies.\nIn Brazil, for example, the beachfront Trump Hotel Rio de Janeiro \u2014 one of Mr. Trump\u2019s many branding deals, in which he does not have an equity stake \u2014 is part of a broad investigation by a federal prosecutor who is examining whether illicit commissions and bribes resulted in apparent favoritism by two pension funds that invested in the project.\nSeveral of Mr. Trump\u2019s real estate ventures in India \u2014 where he has more projects underway than in any location outside North America \u2014 are being built through companies with family ties to India\u2019s most important political party. This makes it more likely that Indian government officials will do special favors benefiting Mr. Trump\u2019s projects, including pressuring state-owned banks to extend favorable loans.\nIn Ireland and Scotland, executives from Mr. Trump\u2019s golf courses have been waging two separate battles with local officials. The most recent centers on the Trump Organization\u2019s plans to build a flood-prevention sea wall at the course on the Irish coast. Some environmentalists say the wall could destroy an endangered snail\u2019s habitat \u2014 a dispute that will soon involve the president of the United States.\nAnd in Turkey, officials including President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a religiously conservative Muslim, demanded that Mr. Trump\u2019s name be removed from Trump Towers in Istanbul after he called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States. More recently, after Mr. Trump came to the defense of Mr. Erdogan \u2014 suggesting that he had the right to crack down harshly on dissidents after a failed coup \u2014 the calls for action against Trump Towers have stopped, fueling worries that Mr. Trump\u2019s policies toward Turkey might be shaped by his commercial interests.\nMr. Trump has acknowledged a conflict of interest in Turkey. \u201cI have a little conflict of interest because I have a major, major building in Istanbul,\u201d he said during a radio interview last year with Stephen K. Bannon, the Breitbart News executive who has since been designated his chief White House strategist. \u201cIt\u2019s a tremendously successful job. It\u2019s called Trump Towers \u2014 two towers, instead of one. Not the usual one. It\u2019s two.\u201d\nThese tangled ties already have some members of Congress \u2014 including at least one Republican representative \u2014 calling on Mr. Trump to provide more information on his international operations, or perhaps for a congressional inquiry into them.\n\u201cYou rightly criticized Hillary for Clinton Foundation,\u201d Representative Justin Amash, Republican of Michigan, said in a Twitter message on Monday. \u201cIf you have contracts w/foreign govts, it\u2019s certainly a big deal, too. #DrainTheSwamp\u201d\nDavid J. Kramer, who served as assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor during the Bush administration, said Mr. Trump\u2019s financial entanglements could undermine decades of efforts by Democratic and Republican presidents to promote government transparency \u2014 and to use the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act to stop contractors from paying bribes to secure government work abroad.\n\u201cThis will make it a little harder to be able to go out and proselytize around these things,\u201d Mr. Kramer said.\nEven if Mr. Trump and his family seek no special advantages from foreign governments, officials overseas may feel compelled to help the Trump family by, say, accelerating building permits or pushing more business to one of the new president\u2019s hotels or golf courses, according to several former State Department officials.\n\u201cThe working assumption on behalf of all these foreign government officials will be that there is an advantage to doing business with the Trump organization,\u201d said Michael H. Fuchs, who was until recently deputy assistant secretary at the bureau of East Asian and Pacific affairs. \u201cThey will think it will ingratiate themselves with the Trump administration. And this will significantly complicate United States foreign policy and our relationships around the world.\u201d\nAt the same time, Mr. Fuchs said, American diplomats in countries where Mr. Trump\u2019s companies operate, fearful of a rebuke from Washington, may be reluctant to take steps that could frustrate business partners or political allies.\nAnother question is, who will be responsible for security at the Trump Towers around the world, especially in the Middle East, which terrorism experts say may now become more appealing targets as symbols of American capitalism built in the name of the president?\nWhat is clear is that there has been very little division, in the weeks since the election, between Mr. Trump\u2019s business interests and his transition effort, with the president-elect or his family greeting real estate partners from India and the Philippines in his office and Mr. Trump raising concerns about his golf course in Scotland with a prominent British politician. Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka, who is in charge of planning and development of the Trump Organization\u2019s global network of hotels, has joined in conversations with at least three world leaders \u2014 of Turkey, Argentina and Japan \u2014 having access that could help her expand the brand worldwide.\nMr. Trump, in the interview with The Times on Tuesday, acknowledged that his move to the Oval Office could help enrich his family. He cited his new hotel a few blocks from the White House, which the Trump Organization has urged diplomats to consider patronizing when in town to meet the president or his team.\nFederal law does not prevent Mr. Trump from taking actions that could benefit him and his family financially; the president is exempt from most conflict-of-interest laws. But the Constitution, through what is called the emoluments clause, appears to prohibit him from taking payments or gifts from a foreign government entity, a standard that some legal experts say he may violate by renting space in Trump Tower in New York to the Bank of China or if he hosts foreign diplomats in one of his hotels.\n\u201cI mean it could be that occupancy at that hotel will be because, psychologically, occupancy at that hotel will be probably a more valuable asset now than it was before, O.K.? The brand is certainly a hotter brand than it was before. I can\u2019t help that, but I don\u2019t care,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding, \u201cThe only thing that matters to me is running our country.\u201d\n Robert D. Blackwill, a former National Security Council member who also served as ambassador to India during the Bush administration, said Mr. Trump still had a chance to demonstrate that he could manage these challenges once he was sworn in.\n\u201cLet\u2019s listen and not prejudge,\u201d said Mr. Blackwill, a Republican who was so critical of Mr. Trump that he endorsed Hillary Clinton. \u201cI want to see what he does as president.\u201d\n\nNation Under Pressure, Ventures Under Scrutiny\nDonald Trump Jr., the president-elect\u2019s oldest son, gushed with triumphalism when he announced a deal in 2014 to attach the family name to the Trump Hotel Rio de Janeiro, a lavish 171-room beachfront project featuring cavernous suites with private plunge pools and a 4,000-square-foot nightclub.\n\u201cThis is an exciting time to develop our first project in South America and the perfect location to do so,\u201d the younger Mr. Trump (his brother Eric is also involved in the family business) said at the time.\nBut just two years later, the venture is embroiled in a criminal investigation in Brazil, pointing to unfulfilled promises that are casting a pall over both the Trump business empire and the president-elect in their dealings in Latin America\u2019s largest country.\nAnselmo Henrique Cordeiro Lopes, a crusading federal prosecutor in the capital, Bras\u00edlia, opened an investigation in the weeks before the American election into $40 million in investments made by two relatively small Brazilian pension funds in the Trump Hotel Rio.\nThe Trump hotel inquiry is looking at why the funds \u2014 Serpro, which invests on behalf of retirees of a state-controlled information technology firm, and Igeprev, which manages the pensions of public employees of the sparsely populated Tocantins State \u2014 put so much of their capital into the venture, which is owned by Mr. Trump\u2019s Brazilian partner, LSH Barra.\nBack in 2014, the hotel might have seemed like a good deal. Brazil was about to host the World Cup soccer tournament that year, while Rio was preparing to be the venue for the 2016 Summer Olympics. At the same time, Rio, the nerve center of Brazil\u2019s energy industry, had been bolstered by large offshore oil discoveries.\nBut Brazil\u2019s economy began to weaken in 2014, undermined by falling commodities prices, colossal graft scandals and political instability that culminated in the ouster this year of President Dilma Rousseff, who was replaced by her vice president, Michel Temer. The result: Brazil is still grappling with its most severe economic crisis in decades.\nThe hotel officially opened for the Olympics, but months later remains unfinished. The top floors of the property, whose design evokes a futuristic pyramid, are closed. Parts of the hotel still resemble a construction site, including the second floor, where pleasure-seekers were supposed to mingle in a nightclub overlooking the Atlantic.\nThe examination of the project by Mr. Lopes, the federal prosecutor, has already found a series of \u201chighly suspicious\u201d potential irregularities warranting a criminal investigation, according to court documents. \u201cIt is necessary to verify if the favoritism shown by the pension funds to LSH and the Trump Organization was due to the payment of illicit commissions and bribes,\u201d Mr. Lopes said in documents filed in October.\nIn his filings, Mr. Lopes said the size of the hotel investments relative to the overall holdings of the small pension funds reflected a highly unusual level of risk, especially for an unfinished venture that failed to capitalize fully on the demand for accommodations during the Olympics. Going further, Mr. Lopes positioned the inquiry within a broader investigation of public pension funds, pillars of the Brazilian economy that often work in tandem with large state-controlled banks and energy companies.\nMr. Trump first took interest in a Rio hotel venture in 2012, when Ivanka Trump was having lunch in Florida with Paulo Figueiredo Filho, a businessman who is a grandson of Jo\u00e3o Figueiredo, the last autocrat of Brazil\u2019s 21-year military dictatorship, which ended in 1985. The younger Mr. Figueiredo spearheaded the hotel venture until recently.\nIn a statement, Mr. Trump\u2019s Brazilian partner, LSH, said it was innocent of any wrongdoing in connection with the investments by the pension funds, and was cooperating with the criminal inquiry.\nAlan Garten, the Trump Organization\u2019s general counsel, said in a statement issued Friday that the investigation was not targeting Mr. Trump or his company \u2014 given that it does not own the hotel \u2014 and \u201chas no knowledge whatsoever regarding any governmental inquiry.\u201d\nThe investigation of the Trump projects is unfolding at an awkward time for the Brazilian authorities. Foreign Minister Jos\u00e9 Serra, Brazil\u2019s top diplomat, publicly declared in July that a Trump presidency would be a \u201cnightmare.\u201d Although President Temer has formally congratulated Mr. Trump on his victory in a letter, he is still among world leaders who have not yet spoken by telephone with the president-elect.\nEven if Brazil\u2019s executive branch actively tries to seek warmer relations with Mr. Trump, officials will face obstacles if they try to quell the investigation. Brazil differs from some other countries in Latin America where presidents can easily exert pressure on prosecutors and judges, with the judiciary steadily growing more independent.\n\u201cBrazilian diplomats could try to avoid the problem of referring to the investigation when dealing with the Trump administration, but that\u2019s about all they can do,\u201d said Maur\u00edcio Santoro, a political scientist at the State University of Rio de Janeiro. \u201cThis is something that could hang over relations between the two countries for years.\u201d\n\nPotential Pitfalls in Dual Roles\nOn the other side of the world, Donald Trump Jr. had other projects he was pushing.\nIn 2012, he flew into Mumbai for a brief meeting with the state\u2019s chief minister at that time, hoping to salvage a residential tower representing the Trump Organization\u2019s first planned project there. He was hoping the chief minister, Prithviraj Chavan, would intervene on his behalf to get the permission needed.\nThe participants recall the meeting differently: Mr. Trump\u2019s partner, Harresh Mehta of Rohan Lifescapes, said development regulations had changed, leaving the project in limbo, and they hoped Mr. Chavan could formalize a policy so that the project could continue. Mr. Chavan said that in a 30-minute meeting, Mr. Trump and his partner were \u201crequesting a concession that could not be given.\u201d\nBy the end of the meeting, in any case, it was fairly clear that the younger Mr. Trump\u2019s presence had not worked any magic. The project was shelved soon after.\n\u201cHe thought the name was so big, we would bend backwards to satisfy him, but that was not the case,\u201d Mr. Chavan said.\nKalpesh Mehta, managing partner of Tribeca Developers of Mumbai, the Trump Organization\u2019s development partner in India, confirmed that Donald Trump Jr. had met with the chief minister, but disputed the claim by Mr. Chavan that he had sought a special favor.\n\u201cThe notion that a request was made by Donald Jr. to waive any regulations is absolutely false,\u201d Mr. Mehta said in the statement, which was issued Friday. \u201cThe Trump Organization does not get involved in the regulatory aspects and/or interacting with government officials related to its projects in India.\u201d\nThis example, analysts here say, points to a potentially serious ethical hazard for a United States president who is also a real estate mogul in India, with five projects underway. Mr. Trump was operating much like other developers in India, who cozy up to politicians \u2014 officially or unofficially \u2014 to push projects through the bureaucracy.\nOften, they must obtain as many as 60 permissions and building permits from government officials, including bureaucrats \u201cwhose main goal in life is to attract rent,\u201d said Saurabh Mukherjea, the chief executive of institutional equities at Ambit Capital, a leading investment bank in India.\nOne of Mr. Trump\u2019s projects, Trump Towers Pune, is in fact under investigation by local authorities after another builder alleged that one of its permits was fraudulent. Panchshil Realty has disputed that accusation, saying the permit in question was not required for the construction. The very nature of the country\u2019s real estate business, however, underscores larger concerns about potential damage to American efforts to discourage corruption in business abroad.\nIn India, real estate is the main vehicle politicians and businessmen have used to invest so-called black money, on which taxes have not been paid. In cities, where land is scarce and extraordinarily valuable, special favors from top political leaders can lead to windfall profits, and negotiations between developers and officials are informal affairs.\nIt is so routine for developers to pay bribes at every step of the approval process that many bureaucrats have informal rate sheets showing exactly how much must be paid to each official.\nPoliticians not only pressure the bureaucracy to approve their pet projects, sometimes even when they are against local regulations, they also squeeze government banks to give out favorable loans.\nTop officials might \u201cthink in some way the U.S. president will help them,\u201d and \u201ccan put in a friendly word with the banks\u201d to extend loans for around 8 percent interest, rather than the characteristic 15 percent, said Vikas S. Kasliwal, the chief executive officer and vice chairman of Shree Ram Urban Infrastructure.\n\u201cIf the son goes himself, if the son is willing to go and meet the prime minister of India, or the urban development minister, that is a very big thing,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will think the president is meeting them.\u201d\nAnother pitfall is that Donald Trump\u2019s partners in major projects are, in some cases, politicians themselves. Most major Indian developers have some sort of alignment, direct or indirect, with regional political leaders, who can assist in acquiring the necessary permits.\nMr. Trump\u2019s first projects in India, which are expected to increase in number over the next year, follow this pattern: His partner for Trump Towers Pune is Panchshil Realty, owned by a family that has a close and longstanding family relationship with one of the state\u2019s most powerful politicians, Sharad Pawar, the head of the small but influential Nationalist Congress Party. (Mr. Trump was photographed \u2014 in an image distributed on Twitter but since taken down \u2014 with executives from Panchshil Realty on Nov. 15.) Mr. Pawar\u2019s daughter, Supriya Sule, a member of Parliament, holds a 2 percent share in Panchshil\u2019s parent company, she said in an interview.\nMr. Trump\u2019s partner in the Trump Tower Mumbai is the Lodha Group, founded by Mangal Prabhat Lodha, vice president of the Bharatiya Janata Party \u2014 currently the governing party in Parliament \u2014 in Maharashtra State. The Lodha Group has already negotiated with the United States government; it announced a landmark purchase of a property, known as the Washington House, on tony Altamount Road, from the American government for 3.75 billion rupees, almost $70 million.\nHis partner in an office complex in Gurgaon, near New Delhi, is IREO, whose managing director, Lalit Goyal, is the brother-in-law of a Bharatiya Janata member of Parliament, Sudhanshu Mittal. Mr. Mittal, in an interview, has denied having any connection with the real estate company.\nSuraj Hegde, the secretary of the All India Congress Committee, a national body of Indian National Congress party members, said he was troubled by the dual roles Mr. Trump and his family would play in Indian affairs \u2014 particularly given real estate\u2019s important role in India\u2019s fast-growing economy, and the clout the United States has on the world stage.\n\u201cBasically this is the globalization of lobbying across countries, which then tries to establish monopoly over real estate,\u201d Mr. Hegde said in an interview. He added that he was already calling for an independent parliamentary investigation of such maneuvers, including Mr. Trump\u2019s real estate ventures in India.\n\u201cEstablishing monopoly at the cost of small players by business connections to Mr. Trump is very worrisome,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not at all healthy for a democracy.\u201d\n\nMixing Business, Politics and Islam\nMr. Trump\u2019s business interests in Turkey are emblematic of two weighty contradictions for a businessman turned politician.\nAs a candidate, Mr. Trump railed against moving American jobs overseas and promised to do something about it. As a businessman, he invested in a partnership with a furniture company here, making luxury furniture in the firm\u2019s factory in western Anatolia and selling it in the United States and worldwide \u2014 a partnership that apparently remains active.\nMr. Trump the candidate inveighed against Muslims and threatened at least a temporary ban on their entering the United States. Mr. Trump the businessman has in recent years had some of his biggest expansions overseas, including in Muslim countries like Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and even Azerbaijan.\nOne of the most visible Muslim-world symbols of that contradiction is in the bustling commercial district of Sisli, on the European side of Istanbul, where a pair of cantilevered modernist towers, nearly 40 stories high, bear Mr. Trump\u2019s name.\nTurkey\u2019s leader, Mr. Erdogan, visited Trump Towers Istanbul \u2014 one holds luxury apartments and one office space, with a shopping mall connecting the two \u2014 after their completion in 2012, with Mr. Trump and Ivanka Trump appearing as part of the celebration the next day.\n\u201cWe look forward to this being the first of many world-class developments undertaken together in Istanbul and throughout Turkey,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a statement issued during the visit.\nBeyond real estate, there is the Trump Organization\u2019s 2013 partnership with Dorya International, a luxury furniture maker with a factory in Manisa Province, near the city of Izmir,  to build pieces sold under the Trump Home Collection.\nBut the presidential campaign demonstrated how the goals of his business and politics ventures can come into direct conflict, particularly once Mr. Trump in December proposed barring Muslims from entering the United States, implying that all Muslims might pose a terrorist threat.\n\u201cWe regret and condemn Trump\u2019s discriminatory remarks,\u201d Bulent Kural, the manager of the Trump Towers Mall, wrote in an email to a reporter at the time, as he announced that the mall was considering removing Mr. Trump\u2019s name. \u201cSuch statements bear no value and are products of a mind that does not understand Islam, a peace religion, at all. Our reaction has been directly expressed to the Trump family. We are reviewing the legal dimension of our relation with the Trump brand.\u201d\nMr. Erdogan weighed in on the issue, too, saying, \u201cThe ones who put that brand on their building should immediately remove it.\u201d\nMr. Trump\u2019s next move helped re-establish his standing. After a failed coup in Turkey in July, he defended Mr. Erdogan\u2019s crackdown on dissidents, saying in an interview with The Times that the United States has to \u201cfix our own mess\u201d before trying to alter the behavior of other nations.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we have a right to lecture,\u201d Mr. Trump said in the interview. \u201cLook at what is happening in our country,\u201d he added, referring to violence in the United States. \u201cHow are we going to lecture when people are shooting policemen in cold blood?\u201d\nIn between his two remarks \u2014 one infuriating the president of Turkey, the other comforting him \u2014 the calls for the renaming of the Trump Towers Mall ended. But much more is at stake in relations between the United States and Turkey than a shopping mall and two skyscrapers.\nTurkey is a key player in United States efforts to combat the Islamic State in the Middle East, and sits next door to Syria as the United States has armed rebel groups in an attempt to remove Syria\u2019s president, Bashar al-Assad, from power.\nThe recent postelection telephone call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Erdogan suggests that business and political roles will continue to be mixed.\nAccording to a Turkish journalist, Amberin Zaman, writing in the independent online news outlet Diken, Mr. Trump told the Turkish leader that he and his daughter \u2014 who participated in the call \u2014 admired both Mr. Erdogan and Mehmet Ali Yalcindag, Mr. Trump\u2019s business associate in the towers, whom he called \u201ca close friend.\u201d\nMs. Zaman, a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, said no government officials had disputed her account of the conversation. \u201cI\u2019m of the opinion they were quite happy for this to be published,\u201d she said. A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump declined to comment about the call.\nJennifer Harris, who served on the staff of the National Intelligence Council and on the State Department\u2019s policy planning staff, said the twin hats that Mr. Trump and his family would be wearing in Turkey would almost certainly complicate the jobs of American diplomats there.\n\u201cIt makes me wonder if the Trump administration will use the power of the state to help political or business allies and hurt political adversaries and business rivals,\u201d she said.\n\nWhat Stance Toward Duterte?\nPresident Duterte\u2019s antidrug campaign has led to the summary deaths of thousands of suspected criminals at the hands of police and vigilantes since he took office June 30. The killing has been condemned by human rights activists \u2014 and the Obama administration.\nIn August, Elizabeth Trudeau, a State Department spokeswoman, said the United States was \u201cvery deeply concerned\u201d about reports of \u201cextrajudicial killings by or at the behest of government authorities of individuals who are suspected to have been in drug activity in the Philippines.\u201d She added, \u201cWe have also made our concerns known.\u201d\nThe question now, former State Department officials say, is just what kind of a stand the Trump administration will take as Mr. Trump and his family balance their personal and financial ties with foreign policy demands.\nMr. Antonio first met Mr. Trump casually in the 1990s and has been his business partner in the Philippines for five years. President Duterte named him special envoy to the United States as the Philippines angrily pushed back at President Obama for criticizing his deadly campaign. At the time of the appointment, Mrs. Clinton was leading in the polls in the United States presidential election.\nMr. Duterte has made clear that he does not appreciate American meddling in his country\u2019s domestic affairs.\n\u201cI am a president of a sovereign state, and we have long ceased to be a colony,\u201d Mr. Duterte told reporters in early September, before a scheduled meeting in Laos with Mr. Obama that never took place. \u201cI do not have any master except the Filipino people, nobody but nobody.\u201d\nMr. Duterte handpicked Mr. Antonio as his intermediary with the United States, said his press secretary, Ernesto Abella, because of his business success, his previous experience as a special envoy to China and the Philippine president\u2019s \u201cdeep intuition about people.\u201d The appointment will be advantageous for the Philippines, Mr. Abella added, because Mr. Trump already knows Mr. Antonio.\nEven before Mr. Trump has been sworn in, Mr. Antonio flew to New York and visited Trump Tower, where he met with Mr. Trump\u2019s children, who are executives at the Trump Organization \u2014 which oversees the president-elect\u2019s real estate ventures. This was a business trip, not a diplomatic one, Robbie Antonio, Mr. Antonio\u2019s son and the managing director of the family business, said in an interview.\nThe two families are considering new ventures as they finish work on the Trump Tower in Makati City, a financial center within metropolitan Manila that is one of the country\u2019s wealthiest enclaves and home to many of the nation\u2019s elite.\nThe $150 million tower \u2014 one of the tallest in the Philippines \u2014 is on the gritty side of Makati about two blocks from Manila\u2019s most notorious red-light district, where it is common to see prostitutes soliciting business and people sleeping on sidewalks. Completion, originally scheduled for this year, is now expected in 2017. About 240 of the 260 units have been sold, said Kristina Garcia, the director for investor relations.\n\u201cWe are bringing Trump to the Philippines because we believe that Trump exemplifies the best quality of real estate anywhere in the world,\u201d Mr. Antonio said in a 2011 video promoting the project \u2014 in which Mr. Antonio is identified as \u201cambassador\u201d and Mr. Trump also appears. \u201cIt also exemplifies luxury and it exemplifies exclusivity.\u201d\nIn the interview at the celebration in Manila on Thursday evening, Robbie Antonio said he had little doubt of his father\u2019s priorities: He will put the Philippines\u2019 interests above those of his company. \u201cIt is for the good of the country now,\u201d he said.\nBut Mr. Fuchs, who helped oversee United States relations with the Philippines as the deputy assistant secretary of state until early this year, said he was deeply troubled by Mr. Trump\u2019s overlapping priorities, particularly given the long list of globally significant issues in play with the Philippines. These include planned joint military exercises in the South China Sea, the fight against militant Islamic groups based in the country\u2019s southern islands, and the human rights abuses taking place.\n\u201cWhat we already have is a blurring of the lines between official and business activities,\u201d Mr. Fuchs said. \u201cThe biggest gray area may not be a President Trump himself advocating for favors for the Trump Organization. It\u2019s the diplomats and career officers who will feel the need to perhaps not do things that will harm the Trump Organization\u2019s interests. It is seriously disturbing.\u201d\n\nOver a Tiny Snail, Big Concerns\nThe vertigo angustior snail is only two millimeters long. But it punches above its weight.\nThe endangered little snail has helped stall Mr. Trump\u2019s plans to build a sea wall to protect the coastline along his Trump International Golf Links course on the west coast of Ireland, in County Clare.\nEnvironmentalists, as well as surfers, list a host of concerns about the proposed wall, particularly its potential impact on sand dunes. Along with the snails, a patch of the dunes near the course is protected by European Union rules. But Mr. Trump\u2019s organization has said the golf resort development might be dead in the water without the sea wall, and many locals welcome the business and the jobs it brings.\nThe battle is likely to be decided next year in front of a national planning board, in the weeks or months after Mr. Trump is inaugurated on Jan. 20, several people said.\nThe planning board was overhauled in the 1980s to insulate it from political meddling, and it now has the confidence of environmentalists. But there is little precedent for the Trump situation, which could involve a public hearing.\n\u201cThey can be long, they can be lively, and a lot of things could be aired,\u201d said Sean O\u2019Leary, the executive director of the Irish Planning Institute, which represents the majority of the country\u2019s professional planners.\nHe noted that the national planning board had considered a development proposed by a politician before, but that was a holiday home that the Irish president wanted to build.\n\u201cThe scale is slightly different,\u201d he said.\nLocal officials have said the Trump Organization needs to resubmit its application by the end of the year. In a statement, the Trump Organization said it was \u201cconsidering all potential coastal protection options at present\u201d and would be in contact with the local authority before Christmas. The snail, the statement said, \u201cis thriving on the site.\u201d\n\u201cIts only material threat is that presented by coastal erosion,\u201d it added.\nCertainly, Mr. Trump\u2019s golf courses in Scotland and Ireland have remained at the fore in the president-elect\u2019s mind, even in recent days. Shortly after his election, he urged a group of \u201cBrexit\u201d campaigners led by Nigel Farage, the head of the U.K. Independence Party, to fight against wind farms in Britain. Wind farms have been a favorite target of Mr. Trump\u2019s in both Britain and Ireland, where he has railed against proposed installations as a potential blight on the views from his resorts.\nAfter a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump initially denied that the matter had been raised with Mr. Farage\u2019s group, Mr. Trump conceded during his interview with The Times this past week that \u201cI might have brought it up.\u201d\nTony Lowes, an activist who runs a group called Friends of the Irish Environment, said Mr. Trump had once called him because Mr. Lowes\u2019s group also happened to oppose a proposed wind farm near Mr. Trump\u2019s Irish course on environmental grounds.\n\u201cHe certainly hates wind farms, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Mr. Lowes said about the call.\nHis group decided against working with Mr. Trump, and is now a leading opponent of his planned sea wall.\n\u201cThe dune system will not be able to develop naturally,\u201d Mr. Lowes said. \u201cIt will be starved of the sand it needs to develop and evolve and it will die.\u201d He added, \u201cThe whole system there is alive and mobile and moving, and the wall is intended to stop that.\u201d\nMr. Trump\u2019s representatives have advanced a number of rationales for the sea wall, with the most straightforward being that they simply want to buffer the land from a continuing erosion problem. The proposal has previously attracted attention because an environmental-impact statement submitted by Mr. Trump\u2019s team highlighted the risks of climate change and its influence on \u201ccoastal erosion rates.\u201d That was a noteworthy claim, since Mr. Trump has called global warming a hoax perpetrated \u201cby and for the Chinese.\u201d\nThe Irish government has zealously courted Mr. Trump. When he visited the course in 2014, he was greeted on the airport tarmac in Shannon with a red carpet, a harpist, a violinist and a singer whose voice cut through the runway clamor.\nMalachy Clerkin of The Irish Times called it \u201ca preposterous welcome\u201d and \u201cthe worst kind of forelock-tugging.\u201d\nMany locals, however, support Mr. Trump\u2019s development. Hugh McNally, the owner of Morrissey\u2019s Bar in Doonbeg Village, about two miles from the course, said the issue had been \u201csensationalized by the media\u201d because of the Trump connection.\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you an example,\u201d he said. Roche, the Swiss pharmaceutical company, announced last year that it would close a plant in nearby Clarecastle, causing the loss of more than 200 jobs. \u201cIf someone told them you\u2019d save those jobs by building any wall, everyone would do it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only reason people are objecting here is because of Trump.\u201d\n\nA Transition and a Business Plan\nMr. Trump\u2019s family appears to have been preparing for the transition to the Oval Office and ways to capitalize on it both in the United States and around the globe.\nIn April, even before Mr. Trump had secured the Republican nomination, his business moved to trademark the name American Idea for use in branding hotels, spas and concierge services, according to the United States Patent and Trademark Office. It was one of more than two dozen trademark applications that Mr. Trump and members of his family filed in the United States and around the world while he was running for president.\nThe applications offer a glimpse of where the Trumps may intend to focus their business endeavors. Last month, representatives of the Trump Organization in Indonesia, where Mr. Trump has been pursuing two hotel deals, filed trademark registrations for use of the Trump name in connection with hotel management. Similar filings have been made in Mexico, Canada and the European Union.\nIvanka Trump has filed at least 25 trademark registrations for her brand of clothing, cosmetics and jewelry in the United States, Canada, the European Union and Mexico since the beginning of the year, most recently in October. Mr. Trump\u2019s wife, Melania, filed an American trademark application for a line of jewelry in August.\nAs he prepares for the presidency, Mr. Trump has made at least one concession so far, he said in the interview with The Times this past week.\n\u201cIn theory, I can be president of the United States and run my business 100 percent, sign checks on my business,\u201d Mr. Trump said, before later adding, \u201cbut I am phasing that out now, and handing that to Eric Trump and Don Trump and Ivanka Trump for the most part, and some of my executives, so that\u2019s happening right now.\u201d", "date": "Nov. 26, 2016", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/26/us/politics/donald-trump-international-business.html", "tags": "around mr. businessman business president united states \u201d trump conflicts potential globe \u2014"}
