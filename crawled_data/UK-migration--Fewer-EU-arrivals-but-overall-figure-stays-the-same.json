{"title": "UK migration: Fewer EU arrivals but overall figure stays the same", "content": "The number of EU citizens moving to the UK has continued to drop, but more people coming from elsewhere means the overall migration rate is unchanged. \nFigures show net migration - the difference between how many people came to the UK for at least 12 months and how many left - was 273,000 last year.\nEU net migration was 74,000 in the year to the end of June 2018, while non-EU net migration was 248,000.\nThe ONS said more Asian citizens had been moving to the UK for work.\nThe Office for National Statistics says 219,000 EU citizens arrived in the UK, as 145,000 left, making net EU migration the lowest it had been since 2012.\nThe data also showed non-EU net migration was the highest since 2004.\nJay Lindop, director of the ONS's centre for international migration, said overall net migration had peaked in 2016 and remained fairly stable since then.\nOverall net migration takes into account the migration of British citizens, of which 49,000 more left the country than returned in the year to the end of June 2018.\nIn the year to the end of June 2017, EU net migration was 107,000 and non-EU net migration was 173,000. Overall net migration was 273,000 in the same period.\nThe government's policy is to reduce overall migration to below 100,000 a year.\nSeparately, the Home Office has released statistics on the number of British citizenship applications, which show the number of EU nationals applying has increased by almost a third over the past year.\nThere were 43,545 requests in the 12 months to the end of September - a rise of 32% on last year.", "date": "29 November 2018", "href": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-46384417", "tags": "left overall uk citizens eu migration end fewer stays net year number figure arrivals"}
