{"title": "U.S. to Restore Full Relations With Cuba, Erasing a Last Trace of Cold War Hostility", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama on Wednesday ordered the restoration of full diplomatic relations with Cuba and the opening of an embassy in Havana for the first time in more than a half-century as he vowed to \u201ccut loose the shackles of the past\u201d and sweep aside one of the last vestiges of the Cold War.\nThe surprise announcement came at the end of 18 months of secret talks that produced a prisoner swap negotiated with the help of Pope Francis and concluded by a telephone call between Mr. Obama and President Ra\u00fal Castro. The historic deal broke an enduring stalemate between two countries divided by just 90 miles of water but oceans of mistrust and hostility dating from the days of Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s charge up San Juan Hill and the nuclear brinkmanship of the Cuban missile crisis.\n\u201cWe will end an outdated approach that for decades has failed to advance our interests, and instead we will begin to normalize relations between our two countries,\u201d Mr. Obama said in a nationally televised statement from the White House. The deal, he added, will \u201cbegin a new chapter among the nations of the Americas\u201d and move beyond a \u201crigid policy that is rooted in events that took place before most of us were born.\u201d\nIn doing so, Mr. Obama ventured into diplomatic territory where the last 10 presidents refused to go, and Republicans, along with a senior Democrat, quickly characterized the rapprochement with the Castro family as appeasement of the hemisphere\u2019s leading dictatorship. Republican lawmakers who will take control of the Senate as well as the House next month made clear they would resist lifting the 54-year-old trade embargo.\n\u201cThis entire policy shift announced today is based on an illusion, on a lie, the lie and the illusion that more commerce and access to money and goods will translate to political freedom for the Cuban people,\u201d said Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida and son of Cuban immigrants. \u201cAll this is going to do is give the Castro regime, which controls every aspect of Cuban life, the opportunity to manipulate these changes to perpetuate itself in power.\u201d\nFor good or ill, the move represented a dramatic turning point in relations with an island that for generations has captivated and vexed its giant northern neighbor. From the 18th century, when successive presidents coveted it, Cuba loomed large in the American imagination long before Fidel Castro stormed from the mountains and seized power in 1959.\nMr. Castro\u2019s alliance with the Soviet Union made Cuba a geopolitical flash point in a global struggle of ideology and power. President Dwight D. Eisenhower imposed the first trade embargo in 1960 and broke off diplomatic relations in January 1961, just weeks before leaving office and seven months before Mr. Obama was born. Under President John F. Kennedy, the failed Bay of Pigs operation aimed at toppling Mr. Castro in April 1961 and the 13-day showdown over Soviet missiles installed in Cuba the following year cemented its status as a ground zero in the Cold War.\nBut the relationship remained frozen in time long after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union, a thorn in the side of multiple presidents who waited for Mr. Castro\u2019s demise and experienced false hope when he passed power to his brother, Ra\u00fal. Even as the United States built relations with Communist nations like China and Vietnam, Cuba remained one of just a few nations, along with Iran and North Korea, that had no formal ties with Washington.\nMr. Obama has long expressed hope of transforming relations with Cuba and relaxed some travel restrictions in 2011. But further moves remained untenable as long as Cuba held Alan P. Gross, an American government contractor arrested in 2009 and sentenced to 15 years in a Cuban prison for trying to deliver satellite telephone equipment capable of cloaking connections to the Internet.\nAfter winning re-election, Mr. Obama resolved to make Cuba a priority for his second term and authorized secret negotiations led by two aides, Benjamin J. Rhodes and Ricardo Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, who conducted nine meetings with Cuban counterparts starting in June 2013, most of them in Canada, which has ties with Havana.\nPope Francis encouraged the talks with letters to Mr. Obama and Mr. Castro and had the Vatican host a meeting in October to finalize the terms of the deal. Mr. Obama spoke with Mr. Castro by telephone on Tuesday to seal the agreement in a call that lasted more than 45 minutes, the first direct substantive contact between the leaders of the two countries in more than 50 years.\nOn Wednesday morning, Mr. Gross walked out of a Cuban prison and boarded an American military plane that flew him to Washington, accompanied by his wife, Judy. While eating a corned beef sandwich on rye bread with mustard during the flight, Mr. Gross received a call from Mr. Obama. \u201cHe\u2019s back where he belongs, in America with his family, home for Hanukkah,\u201d Mr. Obama said later.\nFor its part, the United States sent back three imprisoned Cuban spies who were caught in 1998 and had become a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre for the Havana government. They were swapped for Rolando Sarraff Trujillo, a Cuban who had worked as an agent for American intelligence and had been in a Cuban prison for nearly 20 years, according to a senior American official. Mr. Gross was not technically part of the swap, officials said, but was released separately on \u201chumanitarian grounds,\u201d a distinction critics found unpersuasive.\nThe United States will ease restrictions on remittances, travel and banking, while Cuba will allow more Internet access and release 53 Cubans identified as political prisoners by the United States. Although the embargo will remain in place, the president called for an \u201chonest and serious debate about lifting\u201d it, which would require an act of Congress.\nMr. Castro spoke simultaneously on Cuban television, taking to the airwaves with no introduction and announcing that he had spoken by telephone with Mr. Obama on Tuesday.\n\u201cWe have been able to make headway in the solution of some topics of mutual interest for both nations,\u201d he declared, emphasizing the release of the three Cubans. \u201cPresident Obama\u2019s decision deserves the respect and acknowledgment of our people.\u201d\nOnly afterward did Mr. Castro mention the reopening of diplomatic relations. \u201cThis in no way means that the heart of the matter has been resolved,\u201d he said. \u201cThe economic, commercial and financial blockade, which causes enormous human and economic damages to our country, must cease.\u201d But, he added, \u201cthe progress made in our exchanges proves that it is possible to find solutions to many problems.\u201d\nMr. Obama is gambling that restoring ties with Cuba may no longer be politically unthinkable with the generational shift among Cuban-Americans, where many younger children of exiles are open to change. Nearly six in 10 Americans support re-establishing relations with Cuba, according to a New York Times poll conducted in October. Mr. Obama\u2019s move had the support of the Catholic Church, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Human Rights Watch and major agricultural interests.\nAt a news conference in Washington, Mr. Gross said he supported Mr. Obama\u2019s move toward normalizing relations with Cuba, adding that his own ordeal and the injustice with which Cuban people had been treated were \u201ca consequence of two governments\u2019 mutually belligerent policies.\u201d\n\u201cFive and a half decades of history show us that such belligerence inhibits better judgment,\u201d he said. \u201cTwo wrongs never make a right. This is a game-changer, which I fully support.\u201d\nBut leading Republicans, including Speaker John A. Boehner and the incoming Senate majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, did not. In addition to Mr. Rubio, two other Republican potential candidates for president joined in the criticism. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas called it a \u201cvery, very bad deal,\u201d while former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida said it \u201cundermines the quest for a free and democratic Cuba.\u201d\nA leading Democrat agreed. \u201cIt is a fallacy that Cuba will reform just because the American president believes that if he extends his hand in peace, that the Castro brothers suddenly will unclench their fists,\u201d said Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, the outgoing chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and a Cuban-American.\nWhile the United States has no embassy in Havana, there is a bare-bones facility called an interests section that can be upgraded, currently led by a diplomat, Jeffrey DeLaurentis, who will become the charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires pending the nomination and confirmation of an ambassador.\nMr. Obama has instructed Secretary of State John Kerry to begin the process of removing Cuba from the list of states that sponsor terrorism, and the president announced that he would attend a regional Summit of the Americas next spring that Mr. Castro is also to attend. Mr. Obama will send an assistant secretary of state to Havana next month to talk about migration, and Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker may lead a commercial mission.\nMr. Obama\u2019s decision will ease travel restrictions for family visits, public performances, and professional, educational and religious activities, among other things, but ordinary tourism will still be banned under the law. Mr. Obama will also allow greater banking ties, making it possible to use credit and debit cards in Cuba, and American travelers will be allowed to import up to $400 worth of goods from Cuba, including up to $100 in tobacco and alcohol products.\n\u201cThese 50 years have shown that isolation has not worked,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for a new approach.\u201d\nHe added that he shared the commitment to freedom for Cuba. \u201cThe question is how we uphold that commitment,\u201d he said. \u201cI do not believe we can keep doing the same thing for over five decades and expect a different result.\u201d", "date": "Dec. 17, 2014", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/18/world/americas/us-cuba-relations.html", "tags": "relations cuban castro full \u201c u.s. restore trace erasing war obama last cuba cold hostility"}
