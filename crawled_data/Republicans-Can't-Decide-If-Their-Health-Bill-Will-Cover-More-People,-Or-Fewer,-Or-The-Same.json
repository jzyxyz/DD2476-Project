{"title": "Republicans Can't Decide If Their Health Bill Will Cover More People, Or Fewer, Or The Same", "content": "Republicans can\u2019t seem to figure out if their health care plan will lead to the same number of people with health insurance as have it today, or more people, or less people, or if it doesn\u2019t matter.\nPresident Donald Trump promising, \u201cWe\u2019re going to have insurance for everybody\u201d seems like it happened way more than two months ago.\nThe rhetoric coming out of the White House and Capitol Hill is all over the place, and there\u2019s no mystery about why. \nThe GOP is hell-bent on repealing the Affordable Care Act, the 2010 health care reform law that extended health coverage to 20 million people who didn\u2019t have it before and drove down the national uninsured rate to a historic low.\nEliminating that law means eliminating the federal funding that made those coverage gains possible through tax credits for low- and middle-income people, and expanded Medicaid access to people living near poverty. \nThe American Health Care Act, the Obamacare repeal and \u201creplace\u201d package conceived by House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and endorsed by Trump, does just that. \nThe bill would rescind the Medicaid expansion and reduce future funding for other Medicaid beneficiaries \u2015 which mainly consists of children, pregnant women, people with disabilities and elderly nursing home patients. It also would replace the Affordable Care Act\u2019s tax credits with financial assistance based on age, not income, that would have less value to poorer families than what\u2019s available now.\nAnd Republicans do want to get rid of all those things because they also want to repeal the $600 billion in taxes on wealthy people and health care corporations that help pay for them, and because they philosophically don\u2019t think the federal government should be helping people with their medical costs.\nBut coming right out and saying you want more uninsured people would make you look monstrous. You also can\u2019t say you want to maintain the Affordable Care Act\u2019s coverage, because then you\u2019re a big government RINO who\u2019s soft on Obamacare. \nSo, Republicans pushing Affordable Care Act repeal and their new bill are using a number of rhetorical tricks to make it seem like that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening.\nThey\u2019re even going so far as promising that it won\u2019t, which seems highly suspect given that they aren\u2019t planning to spend the money it would take to prevent it. \nHere\u2019s Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price making this likely impossible promise Friday morning on MSNBC.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe that individuals will lose coverage at all,\u201d Price said. \u201cWe want nobody to lose coverage or lose access to coverage that currently has that, and we want to increase the number of individuals that have access to coverage.\nEarlier Friday, Ryan appeared on conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt\u2019s program and delivered a different message, seemingly acknowledging that his plan can\u2019t cover as many people as Obamacare, while attempting to argue that the Affordable Care Act\u2019s coverage expansion somehow doesn\u2019t count. \nAnd on Wednesday, White House Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney went on MSNBC to deliver yet a different message. \n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at it in a different way,\u201d Mulvaney said when asked about coverage numbers. \u201cInsurance is not really the end goal here.\u201d\nPart of what\u2019s going on is a preemptive strike against the official scorekeepers of legislation on Capitol Hill, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. White House press secretary Sean Spicer, Price and a number of GOP lawmakers have begun a campaign to discredit the agency in advance of its analysis of the House health care bill. \nThe most obvious reason they would do that is they anticipate the CBO is going to deliver them bad news and tell the country that the legislation will result in millions of people becoming uninsured. Brookings Institution scholars predict the Congressional Budget Office will project losses at least 15 million people, and the ratings agency Standard and Poor\u2019s estimates the bill will cause up to 10 million people to lose coverage.\nRyan said this has been weighing on his mind. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to our members about that. We\u2019re going to talk to our members constantly about this, because we\u2019re not going to get into a bidding war with the left about how much we can mandate or put entitlements out there for people,\u201d he said on Hewitt\u2019s show.\nRepublicans also began to preview another strategy to blunt the effects of an unfavorable Congressional Budget Office score: Alternative math.\nPrice countered questions about the CBO and the Brookings Institution estimate by saying the Office of Management and Budget \u2015 which is part of Trump\u2019s White House \u2015 and outside groups would make their own assessments.\nTo wit, Ryan\u2019s office distributed an email to reporters Friday carrying the subject line, \u201cFormer CBO Director: \u2018The American Health Care Act Is A Good Start.\u2019\u201d \nWithin was the content of a Washington Post op-ed penned by Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who held that job from 2003 to 2005 and now is president of the conservative American Action Forum. Holtz-Eakin cited a preliminary analysis of the GOP health care bill projecting more enrollment in private insurance than under the Affordable Care Act.", "date": "\n03/10/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/republican-health-bill-uninsured_n_58c3350be4b0ed71826cd15e", "tags": "people going ca coverage health fewer republicans would cover house act bill care decide"}
