{"title": "Taylor Swift and Katy Perry Ended Bad Blood With an Olive Branch. Here\u2019s How It Started.", "content": "It was the olive branch \u2019grammed round the world.\nOn Tuesday, the yearslong feud between the pop stars Katy Perry and Taylor Swift appeared to come to an end when Ms. Perry sent a wreath of actual olive branches to Ms. Swift. Band-Aids don\u2019t fix bullet holes, but can foliage?\nMs. Swift planted a video of the peace offering on her Instagram account with the words \u201cThank you Katy\u201d and the potent double-heart emoji.\n\u201cSo, I just got to my dressing room and found this actual olive branch,\u201d Ms. Swift, 28, who was in Arizona for the start of her \u201cReputation\u201d tour, says in the video as she zooms and pans across the wreath. \u201cThis means so much to me.\u201d\n[Our pop music critic was at the opening of Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cReputation\u201d tour. Here\u2019s his review.]\nThe camera also shows a note written by Ms. Perry, 33. Repeated viewings suggest it reads: \u201cHey Old Friend \u2014 I\u2019ve been doing some reflecting on past miscommunications and hurt feelings between us. I really want to clear the air\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m deeply sorry.\u201d\nSo what was Ms. Perry apologizing for? And why was Ms. Swift so grateful? You\u2019re a busy person who reads The New York Times. But you\u2019re obviously curious. Please allow me to break it down for you.\nIn September 2008, Ms. Perry and Ms. Swift appeared together in a segment at the MTV Video Music Awards, along with the singer Miley Cyrus.\nAll three were nominated for the show\u2019s best new artist award, along with Jordin Sparks, who had won the sixth season of \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d and Tokio Hotel, an all-male German rock band that would beat all four women.\nThere appeared to be no bad blood between Ms. Perry and Ms. Swift.\n\u201cI think if we weren\u2019t all, like, crazy about each other,\u201d Ms. Swift said, \u201cthat would be awkward, but it\u2019s not.\u201d\nIt later would be.\nAt one of Ms. Swift\u2019s concerts in Los Angeles, in April 2010, she and Ms. Perry performed Ms. Perry\u2019s single \u201cHot n Cold\u201d together.\nThe performance of the song, about an uneven but charged relationship with lyrics like \u201cYou\u2019re in then you\u2019re out,\u201d would later prove to be remarkably ironic.\nThis was a culmination of months of supportive Twitter messages that Ms. Perry and Ms. Swift had exchanged during 2009.\nThere were a lot of them.\nThey seemed to remain friendly for a while, but things changed in 2013. That\u2019s when three dancers left Ms. Swift\u2019s \u201cRed\u201d tour after about six months. They were hired by Ms. Perry, who was preparing her \u201cPrismatic\u201d tour.\nOne of the dancers, Lockhart Brownlie, gave an interview to an Australian newspaper in December 2013, in which he explained that all three had previously toured with Ms. Perry in 2011. He said that Ms. Swift\u2019s tour \u201cwas a great experience and she\u2019s a great person to work with, but then Katy contacted us.\u201d\nSpeculation about a feud grew after a September 2014 article about Ms. Swift in Rolling Stone, pegged to the release of her album \u201c1989.\u201d\nMs. Swift explained the subject of her song \u201cBad Blood,\u201d which would become the album\u2019s fourth single. She said a former friend \u201cdid something so horrible\u201d to her:\nShe later told Rolling Stone that her desire in writing the song \u201cwas not to create some gossip-fest.\u201d\nThat backfired. (See: this rather long article that you\u2019re still reading.)\nHours later, Ms. Perry sent a cryptic tweet: \u201cWatch out for the Regina George in sheep\u2019s clothing \u2026\u201d\nThe reference, for the unaware, was to the antagonist in the film \u201cMean Girls,\u201d who, notably, is blonde, like Ms. Swift. (This is not gratuitous. Hair color will come up again later.)\nMs. Perry did not respond to Ms. Swift\u2019s comments directly. But her tweet and Mr. Brownlie\u2019s previous comments set off a wave of speculation.\n\u201c1989\u201d was released on Oct. 27, 2014, and fans and critics started to dissect the lyrics to \u201cBad Blood.\u201d Most agreed the song was about Ms. Perry.\nAmong the clues was a photo of a Grammy Award in the album\u2019s liner notes next to the song\u2019s lyrics.\nAt the time, Ms. Swift had received seven Grammys. Ms. Perry had won none. Ms. Swift had a habit of burying hidden messages in her liner notes. (This is how fans claim to know which songs on \u201cRed\u201d were about Jake Gyllenhaal.)\nOne striking element of the \u201c1989\u201d rollout: Ms. Swift did not release the album on Spotify. A week later, her label removed her entire catalog from the streaming service. (This would prove important.)\nIn an interview with Billboard in January 2015, ahead of her Super Bowl halftime show, Ms. Perry was asked about her tweet and her then-rumored feud with Ms. Swift.\n\u201cIf somebody is trying to defame my character,\u201d she said, \u201cyou\u2019re going to hear about it.\u201d But she declined to address the speculation.\nWeeks later, in an interview with The Telegraph, Ms. Swift also deflected questions. \u201cI\u2019m never going to talk about her in my interview,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d\nThings stayed quiet until May 2015, when the music video for \u201cBad Blood\u201d was released.\nThe video depicted Ms. Swift as an action hero leading a squad of musicians, models and actors in a crusade against a frenemy who betrays her.\nThat antagonist was played by the actress Selena Gomez, who appeared in a black wig and dark makeup that some said was quite similar to Ms. Perry\u2019s coiffure and look at the time.\nJune 2015: Enter Nicki Minaj.\nAfter nominations for the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards came out, the rapper sent a series of tweets hinting that her video for \u201cAnaconda\u201d would have been nominated for video of the year had she been a different \u201ckind\u201d of artist.\nMs. Swift, whose video for \u201cBad Blood\u201d would eventually win the category, took that as a personal attack. In a since-deleted tweet, she wrote: \u201cI\u2019ve done nothing but love & support you. It\u2019s unlike you to pit women against each other. Maybe one of the men took your slot.\u201d\nThen Ms. Perry weighed in.\nThe first part of her tweet cribs from Ms. Swift\u2019s comments. The second part is believed to be about \u201cBad Blood.\u201d\nAbout a year later, in July 2016, the producer Calvin Harris, who dated Ms. Swift, referenced the existence of the feud in a series of now-deleted tweets.\nMr. Harris unleashed his subtweetstorm after reports broke that Ms. Swift had co-written his hit song \u201cThis Is What You Came For,\u201d a collaboration with Rihanna. He addressed Ms. Swift: \u201cI know you\u2019re off tour and you need someone new to try and bury like Katy ETC but I\u2019m not that guy, sorry. I won\u2019t allow it.\u201d\nMs. Swift did not respond. Ms. Perry shared a GIF of Hillary Clinton shrugging.\nMonths later, in September, a fan asked on Twitter if Ms. Perry would ever collaborate with Ms. Swift. Ms. Perry acknowledged that she would \u2014 on one condition.\nAre you still with us? (Seriously, there are actually important things happening in the news.)\nOn May 19, 2017, ahead of her album \u201cWitness,\u201d Ms. Perry released the song \u201cSwish Swish.\u201d The single, which also featured Ms. Minaj, was widely believed to be a diss track in which Ms. Perry was responding to \u201cBad Blood.\u201d Asked about the song by Jimmy Fallon on \u201cThe Tonight Show,\u201d she declined to answer.\nBut then \u2026\nTwo days later, Ms. Perry spilled the beans in a \u201cCarpool Karaoke\u201d segment with James Corden, the host of \u201cThe Late Late Show.\u201d\nAfter acknowledging that \u201cSwish Swish\u201d was about Ms. Swift, Ms. Perry said that backup dancers were indeed at the heart of their feud. She also blamed Ms. Swift for starting it all by refusing to speak to Ms. Perry and releasing \u201cBad Blood.\u201d\nShe told Mr. Corden that she was ready for the drama to end.\nMs. Swift never responded.\nUnless, of course, you count Ms. Swift\u2019s decision to return her entire music catalog back to streaming services on June 8, 2017, the same day that \u201cWitness\u201d came out. Ms. Perry\u2019s album release seemed lost in all the buzz. Ms. Swift dominated the streaming charts.\nThat weekend, Ms. Perry staged a 96-hour YouTube livestream to promote her album. As part of that, in a conversation with Arianna Huffington, she apologized to Ms. Swift and said she forgave her.\n\u201cI love her, and I want the best for her,\u201d Ms. Perry said, later adding, \u201cGod bless her on her journey. God bless her. Honestly.\u201d She repeated a similar sentiment in a live performance of \u201cSwish Swish\u201d days later.\nMs. Swift did not respond until her Instagram story this week.\nAnd you\u2019re all caught up \u2014 for now.", "date": "May 9, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/09/arts/music/katy-perry-taylor-swift.html", "tags": "blood later ended started video ms. taylor \u201d perry katy olive bad branch swift"}
