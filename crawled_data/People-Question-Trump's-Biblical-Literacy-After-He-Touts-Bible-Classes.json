{"title": "People Question Trump's Biblical Literacy After He Touts Bible Classes", "content": "President Donald Trump praised the idea of introducing Bible literacy classes into public schools on Monday, naturally sparking questions on Twitter about Trump\u2019s own knowledge of the Bible.\u00a0\nIn a morning tweet, the president offered encouragement to politicians in several states who have pushed legislation that would allow public schools to offer an optional elective course on the historical significance of the Bible.\n\u201cNumerous states introducing Bible Literacy classes, giving students the option of studying the Bible,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cStarting to make a turn back? Great!\u201d\nHe posted the tweet soon after a \u201cFox & Friends\u201d segment reporting that at least six states \u2015 North Dakota, Missouri, Indiana, West Virginia, Virginia and Florida \u2015 have seen the introduction of Bible literacy legislation this year.\u00a0\nNorth Dakota state Rep. Aaron McWilliams, who is co-sponsoring a Bible literacy measure, appeared on the conservative talk show Monday morning to defend these bills.\nUnder his bill, the Bible courses would be entirely optional for schools to offer and for students to take, McWilliams said. The classes, he explained, would explore the Bible\u2019s influence on history, legal systems, America\u2019s founding fathers \u2015 and other much broader concepts.\n\u201cThe concept of forgiveness, the concept of recompense, these are things that all come from the Bible,\u201d McWilliams said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have a good foundational understanding of this, we\u2019re not going to understand how the founding fathers of our country and other countries put it together to have the world that we have today.\u201d\nWatch the \u201cFox & Friends\u201d segment with McWilliams below.\nTrump\u2019s approval of Bible literacy classes drew backlash from some of his critics on Twitter, with many chiming in to question his scriptural bona fides.\nThe president, who identifies as a Presbyterian, has repeatedly claimed that the Bible is his favorite book. Yet he\u2019s had a few public blunders when asked to display his own knowledge of the Scriptures. He said in 2016 that his favorite Bible verse is the one that demands \u201can eye for an eye\u201d as punishment for crimes. But that verse from Exodus was later\u00a0specifically addressed by Jesus, who told his followers to \u201cturn the other cheek\u201d to their enemies instead.\nDuring a visit to Liberty University the same year, Trump famously referred to the biblical book Second Corinthians as \u201cTwo Corinthians,\u201d eliciting some snickers from students at the evangelical school.\nFamily Research Council president Tony Perkins, a longtime Trump ally who helped craft the Liberty University speech, later admitted that the presidential candidate\u2019s botched reference \u201cshows that he\u2019s not familiar with the Bible.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s ability to quote Scripture appears to have improved after he was elected to the White House, including in speeches after the\u00a0Las Vegas\u00a0and Parkland, Florida, mass shootings.\u00a0\u00a0\nStill, some Christian and Jewish Americans suggested on Monday that there were other Bible verses the president should familiarize himself with.\u00a0\nSome pointed out that the Bible calls on people of faith to welcome the stranger \u2015 something Trump\u2019s critics believe his immigration policies have failed to do.\nOthers pointed out that the Bible often presents God as a defender of the poor, the sick and the powerless \u2015 and that it calls on religious people to show compassion for those marginalized members of society.\u00a0\nTwitter users noted that this responsibility to care for the marginalized doesn\u2019t extend only to individuals. The Bible, they said, calls on governments to be just, too.\u00a0\nRachel Laser, president of\u00a0Americans United for Separation of Church and State, described Trump\u2019s tweet as an attempt to \u201cpander to his Religious Right base,\u201d particularly in light of recent polling that suggests his approval rating among white evangelicals dipped during the partial government shutdown.\n\u201cAs the leader of our diverse nation, the President should support religious freedom for all, not a select few \u2015 and these bills do just the opposite,\u201d Laser told HuffPost in an email.\nIn 2018, lawmakers in Alabama, Iowa and West Virginia floated Bible literacy bills that were eventually defeated, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. The effort had been more successful the previous year in Kentucky, where lawmakers passed a bill\u00a0that allowed Bible courses to be taught in public schools. The ACLU contends that, in practice, these classes in Kentucky often flout constitutional restrictions that prohibit public school teachers from proselytizing students.\u00a0\nAmericans United for Separation of Church and State says these bills are part of a larger coordinated campaign by\u00a0Christian nationalist groups. The effort, dubbed\u00a0Project Blitz, seeks to flood state legislatures across the country with centrally crafted \u201cmodel\u201d bills that promote conservative Christian views.\nAlong with the Bible literacy bills, there\u2019s been a recent push to have the national motto \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d posted on public property, including public schools. Lawmakers in Alaska, Kentucky, Missouri, South Carolina and Indiana have already introduced \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d bills this year.\u00a0\nProject Blitz has also been associated with bills that seek to allow workers in the private and public sectors to deny service to LGBTQ people and others based on the workers\u2019 religious beliefs.\u00a0\n\u201cAs evidenced by Project Blitz, the goal of these [Biblical literacy] bills is not to have an objective discussion about the Bible at all but to promote Christianity and ultimately to push a more aggressive political agenda that allows religion to be used to discriminate,\u201d Laser said.\u00a0", "date": "\n01/28/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-bible-literacy-classes-public-schools_n_5c4f1a2ce4b0287e5b8cf500", "tags": "literacy people public bible classes \u201d trump \u2015 touts bills biblical question"}
