{"title": "Tesla shows off solar roof tiles", "content": "Roof tiles with built-in solar panels have been unveiled by Tesla chief executive Elon Musk. \nThe tiles, made from glass, are intended to be a more attractive way to add solar panels to homes, compared with currently-used solar technology. \nThe launch took place in Universal Studios, Los Angeles, on what used to be the set for the television show Desperate Housewives. \nIt comes with Tesla due to take over struggling energy firm Solar City. \nSome of the electric carmaker's investors have expressed concern over the takeover, suggesting it is a Tesla-funded bail-out of a company Mr Musk has a vested interest in as its biggest shareholder. \nSolar City\u2019s chief executive is Mr Musk\u2019s cousin. \nBringing the solar tiles to the Desperate Housewives set was a way of displaying the idea\u2019s key selling point: it looks far better than solar panelling. Mr Musk jokingly described it as a \u201csweet roof!\u201d. \nNo price was given for the tiles, which come in a variety of colours and styles, though Mr Musk did say it would be cheaper than fitting a traditional roof and then adding solar on top. \nAlso part of the launch was Powerwall 2, Tesla\u2019s home battery product. The primary function of the Powerwall is to store any surplus energy from the solar panels. It will cost $5,500 (\u00a34,511), Mr Musk said. \nTesla posted a surprise profit in its last quarterly earnings - its first in three years. \nThe $2.6bn acquisition of Solar City seems set to see the company plunge back into the red, but Mr Musk insisted on Friday that the deal made sense as having separate companies would \u201cslow things down\u201d.\nTesla shareholders vote on the acquisition on 17 November.\nFollow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC and on Facebook", "date": "29 October 2016", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-37809151", "tags": "panels set solar tiles city chief roof tesla shows musk"}
