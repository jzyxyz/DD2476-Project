{"title": "Amid North Carolina Election Probe, Voters Are Scared, Confused And Angry", "content": "TAR HEEL, N.C. \u2015 Emma Shipman\u2019s house is hidden away at the end of a long and narrow, bumpy dirt road. But over the last week, the 87-year-old says she\u2019s been stunned at how many reporters have made the trek. \nShipman holds key evidence in a closely watched probe into irregularities involving absentee ballots in the state\u2019s 9th Congressional District. Shortly before this year\u2019s election, Shipman says a woman came to her home and took her unsealed but filled-out absentee ballot, which is illegal in North Carolina. Then, a few days before Election Day,\u00a0Shipman says the woman returned with a sealed ballot and stamps and asked her to turn it in. Shipman said she was suspicious, so she went to the polls on her own and decided to cast an in-person vote instead.\nState investigators are trying to figure out how many more people like Shipman were illegally asked to turn over their absentee ballots. If they find enough irregularities, they could choose to order a new election. HuffPost spoke with voters, including Shipman, whose absentee ballots weren\u2019t returned to election officials in Bladen County, the center of the investigation. Some were surprised to learn of the irregularities at all, while one woman said she was angry.\u00a0\nShipman, who is black, submitted a written affidavit to the state board of elections through the state Democratic Party last week. Sitting in her living room Wednesday evening, she said she was glad she spoke up but had grown increasingly more scared the more attention she got.\n\u201cI wonder what the other side is going to do. They see me on TV and see me talk and all that stuff, they\u2019re going to come back and get on me or what,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are so mean that it isn\u2019t even funny. There\u2019s something they may come back to do to me. I think about that, too.\u201d\nInvestigators are trying to figure out if there\u2019s a nefarious reason for so many unreturned absentee ballots in Bladen County, which has a large black population, and nearby Robeson County, which is majority Native American.\nIn Bladen County, 40 percent of absentee ballots were never mailed back. In Robeson, 62 percent were not returned, according to an analysis by Michael Bitzer, a political science professor at Catawba College in North Carolina.\nBoth counties far exceeded the district\u2019s non-return rate of 24 percent. Mark Harris, the Republican who ultimately won the congressional race, won 61 percent of the absentee vote in Bladen, even though 19 percent of the absentee ballots submitted came from registered Republicans. The non-return rate in the 9th District overall was the highest of any of the state\u2019s 13th congressional districts.\nIn recent days, three people have come forward to local television station WSOC and BuzzFeed News to say they were hired to collect absentee ballots, something that violates state law. All of those people have said they worked for McCrae Dowless, a campaign operative with a criminal history who was working for a contractor on behalf of Harris. Dowless did not respond to a request for an interview Wednesday. \nLisa Britt, Dowless\u2019 stepdaughter, told BuzzFeed she worked for Dowless\u00a0but denied illegally taking absentee ballots. Britt signed as a witness on 44 absentee ballots and listed her address as a unit in an apartment complex called Village Oak. State records show 17 unreturned absentee ballots at the complex. A woman inside the address Britt listed on Wednesday refused to come to the door and said she had nothing to say.\u00a0\nOne of the unreturned ballots at the Village Oak complex was from Miriam Bellamy. In an interview Wednesday at her home, she said she had mailed back her absentee ballot but had been given inconsistent information about how much postage to put on it. Bellamy, 57, said two women came to her door and offered to serve as the required witnesses for filling out an absentee ballot in the state. Bellamy said she took the women up on their offer but then sent the ballot in on her own. She seemed unaware of the larger investigation but nonetheless was angry that her vote apparently didn\u2019t make it to election officials.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mess. I voted for nothing. My vote don\u2019t count. Somebody stole my vote from me. I\u2019m thinking they stole mine, they got plenty of other people\u2019s, too,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is terrible. Isn\u2019t this terrible?\u201d\nTwo Bladen County women, Ida Collins and Willa Brown, who live about a 25-minute drive from the Village Oak complex, were surprised to learn their names showed up on the list of voters who had not returned absentee ballots. Neither recalled requesting one, though state records show both women requested and were sent a ballot. \u00a0\nMcCrae Dowless paid workers with \u201cwads of cash,\u201d Jessica Dowless, one of his employees, told BuzzFeed. (Jessica Dowless\u2019 husband is distantly related to McCrae Dowless, BuzzFeed reported.) \nSeveral people suspected of working with Dowless were not home when HuffPost knocked on their doors Wednesday. \u00a0\nWhile Shipman says she\u2019s glad she spoke up about what happened to her, she also said she\u2019s gotten angrier as she has reflected on what happened to her.\n\u201cAll this I\u2019m going through, I feel like I\u2019m going through it by myself,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cShe didn\u2019t do nobody like that but me.\u201d", "date": "\n12/06/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/north-carolina-investigation_n_5c089e8ae4b0844cda4fcd05", "tags": "election ballots voters angry ballot \u201d absentee carolina state dowless shipman north confused probe amid scared"}
