{"title": "Outside Spending Targets Wisconsin Sen- Tammy Baldwin", "content": "By Emma Leathley\nOutside spending against Democratic incumbent Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin has so far exceeded the combined outside spending against the other 21 Democratic Party senators up for reelection in 2018 by a factor of 5.\nThere has been $3.1 million in outside spending against Baldwin, and about $532,000 against the other Democratic incumbents combined. (Another $6,214 has been spent against Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who caucuses with Democrats). \u00a0\nBaldwin is one of 10 Senate Democrats running for reelection in states that President Donald Trump carried in 2016. Nearly all of the conservative-aligned outside spending has targeted Baldwin, however.\nBaldwin has been a senator since 2013 and was formerly the representative for Wisconsin\u2019s 2nd Congressional District.\nAmong Democratic senators in Trump-carried states, the next largest amount was about $47,000 targeting West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin. About $42,000 has been spent against Missouri Senator Claire McCaskill, according to FEC data.\n\u201cOutside spending\u201d refers to political expenditures by groups or individuals not coordinated with candidates\u2019 fundraising committees.\nOn the Republican side, outside spending against GOP Senate candidates is even higher.\nIn the 2018 cycle, about $4.7 million of the roughly $5.2 million \u2013 or around 90 percent \u2013 of outside spending against all Republican candidates for the Senatehas targeted Alabama\u2019s Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore. All but about $295,000 of the $4.7 million targeted Moore before the Republican primary in September. Outside spending after the primary has come from two groups, The Advocacy Fund and Highway 31.\nAmong Republicans, the next highest total was the $28,000 targeting one of Baldwin\u2019s Republican challengers, Kevin Nicholson, who has the support of former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon.\nNicholson is a former Democrat who once\u00a0worked for the Democratic National Committee and even spoke at its 2000 convention.\nUline Inc, a Wisconsin-based shipping supply company owned by Illinois-based conservative donor Richard Uihlein, gave $3.5 million to the pro-Nicholson super PAC Solutions for Wisconsin. Uihlein\u2019s investments also include several resorts, spas and restaurants in the state.\nSolutions for Wisconsin, in turn, has contributed $1.5 million to Americas PAC and Restoration PAC, which represent the second and third largest outside spenders opposing Baldwin. Uihlein also gave $250,000 directly to Americas PAC. He is the chief donor to a super PAC that has funded ads benefiting Moore as well, The Daily Beast reported.\nTwo advisors Nicholson is replacing on his campaign are taking positions at Solutions for Wisconsin.\nSo far in the 2018 cycle, Uihlein has funded roughly $6.1 million in outside spending, all of which went toward conservative groups.\nThe outside spending group that has spent the most against Baldwin is Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, a politically active nonprofit that does not disclose its donors. Freedom Partners has spent around $1.7 million to defeat Baldwin.", "date": "\n11/29/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/outside-spending-targets-wisconsin-sen-tammy-baldwin_b_5a1f1205e4b00579aa29f9f1", "tags": "spent uihlein tammy baldwin wisconsin pac targets republican democratic million sen- outside spending"}
