{"title": "In Ordinary Lives, U.S. Sees the Work of Russian Agents", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 They had lived for more than a decade in American cities and suburbs from Seattle to New York, where they seemed to be ordinary couples working ordinary jobs, chatting to the neighbors about schools and apologizing for noisy teenagers.\nBut on Monday, federal prosecutors accused 11 people of being part of a Russian espionage ring, living under false names and deep cover in a patient scheme to penetrate what one coded message called American \u201cpolicy making circles.\u201d\nAn F.B.I. investigation that began at least seven years ago culminated with the arrest on Sunday of 10 people in Yonkers, Boston and northern Virginia. The documents detailed what the authorities called the \u201cIllegals Program,\u201d an ambitious, long-term effort by the S.V.R., the successor to the Soviet K.G.B., to plant Russian spies in the United States to gather information and recruit more agents.\nThe alleged agents were directed to gather information on nuclear weapons, American policy toward Iran, C.I.A. leadership, Congressional politics and many other topics, prosecutors say. The Russian spies made contact with a former high-ranking American national security official and a nuclear weapons researcher, among others. But the charges did not include espionage, and it was unclear what secrets the suspected spy ring \u2014 which included five couples \u2014 actually managed to collect.\nAfter years of F.B.I. surveillance, investigators decided to make the arrests last weekend, just after an upbeat visit to President Obama by the Russian president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, said one administration official. Mr. Obama was not happy about the timing, but investigators feared some of their targets might flee, the official said.\nCriminal complaints filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan on Monday read like an old-fashioned cold war thriller: Spies swapping identical orange bags as they brushed past one another in a train station stairway. An identity borrowed from a dead Canadian, forged passports, messages sent by shortwave burst transmission or in invisible ink. A money cache buried for years in a field in upstate New York.\nBut the network of so-called illegals \u2014 spies operating under false names outside of diplomatic cover \u2014 also used cyber-age technology, according to the charges. They embedded coded texts in ordinary-looking images posted on the Internet, and they communicated by having two agents with laptops containing special software pass casually as messages flashed between them.\nNeighbors in Montclair, N.J., of the couple who called themselves Richard and Cynthia Murphy were flabbergasted when a team of F.B.I. agents turned up Sunday night and led the couple away in handcuffs. One person who lives nearby called them \u201csuburbia personified,\u201d saying that they had asked people for advice about the local schools. Others worried about the Murphys\u2019 elementary-age daughters.\nJessie Gugig, 15, said she could not believe the charges, especially against Mrs. Murphy. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t have been spies,\u201d she said jokingly. \u201cLook what she did with the hydrangeas.\u201d\nExperts on Russian intelligence expressed astonishment at the scale, longevity and dedication of the program. They noted that Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian prime minister and former president and spy chief, had worked to restore the prestige and funding of Russian espionage after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the dark image of the K.G.B.\n\u201cThe magnitude, and the fact that so many illegals were involved, was a shock to me,\u201d said Oleg D. Kalugin, a former K.G.B. general who was a Soviet spy in the United States in the 1960s and 1970s under \u201clegal\u201d cover as a diplomat and Radio Moscow correspondent. \u201cIt\u2019s a return to the old days, but even in the worst years of the cold war, I think there were no more than 10 illegals in the U.S., probably fewer.\u201d\nMr. Kalugin, now an American citizen living outside Washington, said he was impressed with the F.B.I.\u2019s penetration of the spy ring. The criminal complaints are packed with vivid details gathered in years of covert surveillance \u2014 including monitoring phones and e-mail, placing secret microphones in the alleged Russian agents\u2019 homes, and numerous surreptitious searches.\nThe authorities also tracked one set of agents based in Yonkers on trips to an unidentified South American country, where they were videotaped receiving bags of cash and passing messages written in invisible ink to Russian handlers in a public park, according to the charges.\nProsecutors said the \u201cIllegals Program\u201d extended to other countries around the world. Using fraudulent documents, the charges said, the spies would \u201cassume identities as citizens or legal residents of the countries to which they are deployed, including the United States.\nIllegals will sometimes pursue degrees at target-country universities, obtain employment, and join relevant professional associations\u201d to deepen false identities.\nOne message from bosses in Moscow, in awkward English, gave the most revealing account of the agents\u2019 assignment. \u201cYou were sent to USA for long-term service trip,\u201d it said. \u201cYour education, bank accounts, car, house etc. \u2014 all these serve one goal: fulfill your main mission, i.e. to search and develop ties in policymaking circles and send intels [intelligence reports] to C[enter].\u201d\nIt was not clear what the intelligence reports were about, though one agent was described as meeting an American government employee working in a nuclear program. The defendants were charged with conspiracy, not to commit espionage, but to fail to register as agents of a foreign government, which carries a maximum sentence of 5 years in prison; 9 were also charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years. They are not accused of obtaining classified materials.\nThere were also hints that Russian spy bosses feared their agents, ordered to go native in prosperous America, might be losing track of their official purpose. Agents in Boston submitted an expense report with such vague items as \u201ctrip to meeting\u201d for $1,125 and \u201ceducation,\u201d $3,600.\nIn Montclair, when the Murphys wanted to buy a house under their names, \u201cMoscow Center,\u201d or \u201cC.,\u201d the S.V.R. headquarters, objected.\n\u201cWe are under an impression that C. views our ownership of the house as a deviation from the original purpose of our mission here,\u201d the New Jersey couple wrote in a coded message. \u201cFrom our perspective purchase of the house was solely a natural progression of our prolonged stay here. It was a convenient way to solving the housing issue, plus \u2018to do as the Romans do\u2019 in a society that values home ownership.\u201d\nMuch of the ring\u2019s activity \u2014 and the F.B.I. investigators\u2019 surveillance \u2014 took place in and around New York. The alleged agents were spotted in a bookstore in Lower Manhattan, a bench near the entrance to Central Park and a restaurant in Sunnyside, Queens.\nSecret exchanges were made at busy locations like the Long Island Rail Road\u2019s station in Forest Hills, where F.B.I. watchers in 2004 spotted one defendant who is not in custody, Christopher R. Metsos, the charging papers say.\nThe arrests made a splash in neighborhoods around the country, as F.B.I. teams spent all Sunday night hunting through houses and cars, shining flashlights and carting away evidence.\nIn Cambridge, Mass., the couple known as Donald Heathfield and Tracey Foley, who appeared to be in their 40s and had two teenage sons, lived in an apartment building on a residential street where some Harvard professors and students live.\n\u201cShe was very courteous; she was very nice,\u201d Montse Monne-Corbero, who lives next door, said of Ms. Foley. The sons shoveled snow for her in the winter, Ms. Monne-Corbero said, but they also had \u201cvery loud\u201d parties.\nLila Hexner, who lives in the building next door, said Ms. Foley told her she was in the real estate business. \u201cShe said they were from Canada,\u201d Ms. Hexner said.\nAnother of those charged, Mikhail Semenko, was a stylish man in his late 20s who drove a Mercedes S-500, said Tatyana Day, who lives across the street from him in Arlington, Va. He had a brunette girlfriend and the young couple spoke to one another in Russian and \u201ckept to themselves,\u201d Ms. Day said.", "date": "JUNE 28, 2010", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/29/world/europe/29spy.html", "tags": "american ordinary work f.b.i sees russian u.s. \u201d one lives years agents \u2014"}
