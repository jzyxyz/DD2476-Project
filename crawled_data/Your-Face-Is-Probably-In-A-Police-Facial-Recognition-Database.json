{"title": "Your Face Is Probably In A Police Facial Recognition Database", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2015 Over 117 million American adults are included in facial recognition databases used by law enforcement agencies, according to a new study from Georgetown Law\u2019s Center on Privacy and Technology.\n\u201cThe Perpetual Line Up\u201d found that 1 out of 2 adults appear in a facial recognition database. At least 1 in 4 state and local law enforcement agencies run searches with their own databases or another agency\u2019s system (such as the FBI), or have the option to run searches in a system. \nClare Garvie, the report\u2019s lead author, said one concern about the databases is underregulation. \n\u201cWe have to rely on the police department that uses the technology to decide whether to put controls on how they use it \u2014 and what we found is that there are very few controls,\u201d she told The Huffington Post. \u00a0\nThe study found only one department out of 52 total where elected officials approve the department\u2019s facial recognition use policy. Four of the responsive agencies have a policy that is made available to the public. Twenty-four departments did not provide a policy to the researchers and only one jurisdiction received legislative approval of its policy. \nOnly 10 agencies \u2015 including the FBI \u2015 said they internally audit use of their facial recognition systems. Researchers found that some of these policies are \u201cnon-operational,\u201d meaning the departments don\u2019t actually regulate use despite having guidelines that say they do. \nThe lack of oversight is causing departments to more aggressively implement the use of the databases, Garvie said. At least 26 states \u2015 and maybe up to 30 \u2015 allow law enforcement agencies to conduct searches of or request search information from driver\u2019s license and photo ID databases. \nDepartments are also purchasing technology that allows them to complete facial recognition in real time. The LAPD already does this. Garvie says the technology will soon be used in New York and Dallas. \u00a0\n\u201cThe part that bothers me is that this has been done in secret,\u201d Garvie said. \u201cThis has been done by and large without the consultation of the people on which the systems are used.\u201d\nThe databases have a disproportionate effect on African-Americans. Researchers discovered that facial recognition software less accurately identifies black people even though they are overrepresented in the databases. \n\u201cIf police are looking for an African-American suspect, they may miss even if that person is in their database \u2014 it may not find that person,\u201d Garvie said. \u201cBut these systems are not designed to give no for an answer. They\u2019re designed to give a list of possible matches. So if they don\u2019t find the right person, they provide a list of the wrong people \u2014 and that will happen more with African-Americans.\u201d \nBlack Americans are more likely to be arrested than their white peers, which means that there are more black faces in mug shot-based facial recognition databases. Not everyone who is arrested and has a mug shot taken is found guilty, but those photos aren\u2019t usually scrubbed from the database. \nPolicing and surveillance technology is also targeted disproportionately at black people. \nThe\u00a0LAPD tracks the \u201csuspicious activities\u201dof civilians\u00a0via the Nationwide Suspicious Activity Reporting Initiative. More than 30 percent of the reports involved black residents, according to an inspector general\u2019s audit of the program in January 2015. Only 9.6 percent of the city\u2019s population\u00a0is black. \nBaltimore\u2019s police department tracks the cell phone use of residents and films their movements using drones. BPD also routinely violates the constitutional rights of black residents via excessive force and meaningless stops and seizures. The ACLU of Maryland argues that these practices heighten the number of black people who interact with the city\u2019s criminal justice system and makes them more susceptible to popping up in a facial recognition search. \nThe surveillance may also cause people to think twice before attending a protest or behaving freely in public, Garvie said. \nThe FBI and local police have a history of surveilling social movements \u2015 such as COINTELPRO during the civil rights era, which allowed the government to stifle free speech. \nOnly one department surveyed by researchers had an explicit policy prohibiting officers from using the database to track individuals engaging in political or religious free speech. \n\u201cThe participation in free speech and free assembly, in voicing our opinions in public, would be curtailed \u2014 and I think that\u2019s one of the biggest risks here,\u201d Garvie said\nRead the entire report below: ", "date": "\n10/19/2016", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/facial-recognition-databases_n_58079fc6e4b0dd54ce36d685", "tags": "face garvie facial databases recognition \u201d \u2015 probably database black police use"}
