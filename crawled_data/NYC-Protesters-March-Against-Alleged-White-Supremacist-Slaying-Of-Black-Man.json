{"title": "NYC Protesters March Against Alleged White Supremacist Slaying Of Black Man", "content": "\u00a0NEW YORK \u2015 Nelini Stamp wants America to say Timothy Caughman\u2019s name \u2015 not the name of the man who killed him.\u00a0\n\u201cTimothy was killed by a white supremacist, by a white terrorist,\u201d Stamp told a crowd of about 300 protesters Friday evening in Manhattan\u2019s Union Square.\nThis man, she said, \u201ccame from Baltimore to New York City \u2015 our city \u2015 to kill black people. He killed Timothy. We will not say this man\u2019s name because he wants to be known. Instead we will say Timothy\u2019s name to make sure no one ever forgets Timothy.\u201d\u00a0\nStamp, of the progressive social justice group Resist Here, then led the protesters on a solemn, 22-block march north.\u00a0\n\u201cAll across NYC!\u201d they chanted. \u201cResist white supremacy!\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cSay his name!\u201d they yelled. \u201cTimothy Caughman!\u201d\u00a0\nStamp led them in song, too:\u00a0\nAnd sometimes they marched in silence.\u00a0\nThe man accused of killing 66-year-old Caughman \u2015 a 28-year-old white supremacist and Army veteran loner from Baltimore \u2015 came to New York to kill black men, police said.\u00a0\nThe attacker spotted Caughman on Monday evening on 9th Avenue near 36th Street in Manhattan. Caughman,\u00a0who lived in a nearby apartment, was digging through trash for cans and bottles,\u00a0as he did most days, to redeem the recyclables for money.\u00a0\nThe man stabbed Caughman with an 18-inch-blade sword.\n\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d Caughman screamed, according to a witness. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\nCaughman managed to walk two blocks to a police precinct. An ambulance arrived, but he was later pronounced dead at the hospital.\u00a0\nSurveillance footage showed what appeared to be the same man who fatally stabbed Caughman following another black man around Manhattan that night, but he didn\u2019t end up attacking him.\u00a0\nJames Harris Jackson turned himself in to police. He faces charges of second-degree murder as a hate crime.\u00a0\n\u201cHe told the cops, \u2018I\u2019ve hated black men since I was a kid,\u201d a law enforcement official familiar with his processing\u00a0told The New York Times. \u201cI\u2019ve had these feelings since I was a young person. I hate black men.\u2019\u201d\u00a0\nOne of the speakers Friday night, Jason Walker, an activist with the group Vocal New York, said he believed that Caughman\u2019s killer came to New York in part because President Donald Trump\u00a0had \u201cset a tone of white supremacy and nationalism\u201d in America. His words echoed the connection to the president many others at the march drew, including other speakers.\n\u201cWhite folks now have felt encouraged and emboldened to take steps to target folks that look like me,\u201d Walker said. \u201cOur American system is to blame. It\u2019s not just the person that plunged that knife into his black body.\u201d\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center tracked more than 1,000 hate-related incidents\u00a0in the month after Trump\u2019s Nov. 8 election victory, a surge they attributed to his hateful campaign rhetoric. The perpetrators in about 37 percent of those incidents either directly referenced Trump, his campaign slogan or his comments about sexually assaulting women, the SPLC said.\u00a0\nThe New York Police Department tracked 56 hate crimes from the beginning of 2017 to Feb. 12, a 45 percent increase over the same period in 2016.\u00a0\nAfter Caughman was killed, the New York Post and New York Daily News needlessly published information about his criminal history.\n\u201cNot only was he murdered on the streets, but he was murdered again in the media,\u201d Walker said.\nOn Election Day, Caughman tweeted: \u201cStanding on line waiting to vote I love america.\u201d\u00a0\nLinda Sarsour, an organizer of the massive Women\u2019s March on Washington,\u00a0reminded the crowd that Caughman had joy in his life.\u00a0\n\u201cMy son is 17 years old, and his name is Tamir,\u201d Sarsour said. \u201cMy son is an autograph collector.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cTimothy Caughman was an autograph collector,\u201d she said, who loved celebrities. \u201cHe was a human being. He had joy. And that\u2019s something that gave him joy. He was somebody\u2019s son. He was somebody\u2019s friend, and he was killed here, in our city, in the most progressive, liberal city in the world.\u201d\u00a0\nThe protesters Friday finished their march in Herald Square, just blocks from where Caughman was stabbed.\u00a0\nThey knelt, raised fists, had a moment of silence, said prayers and laid flowers.\u00a0\nAt one point, Stamp asked the black protesters in the crowd to repeat after her, and for the white protesters to respectfully stay silent.\u00a0\n\u201cI am,\u201d she said, \u201csomebody, and I deserve full equality, right here, right now.\u201d\u00a0\nShe and the other black protesters repeated the sentence 11 times, each time growing louder. By the end, they were yelling it, and tears welled up in Stamp\u2019s eyes.\u00a0\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this article misidentified Jason Walker as Jason Walters.\u00a0\nAmerica does not do a good job of tracking incidents of hate and bias. We need your help to create a database of such incidents across the country, so we all know what\u2019s going on.
