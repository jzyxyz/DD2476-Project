The 86-year-old still holds a seat in the European Parliament and a post as a regional councillor in the south of France.\nMr Le Pen launched a legal challenge against his suspension, and on 2 July, a court decided to overturn it.\nThe judge ruled that the correct procedure had not been followed and ordered that an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) be held to discuss his future. \nThat meeting took place on Thursday, and Mr Le Pen has now been expelled.  \nHis dismissal follows a series of remarks regarded as inflammatory and a feud with his daughter. \nEarlier this year he restated his characterisation of the Holocaust as a \"detail\" - a view he first expressed in 1987 - and also said he had never considered France's wartime collaborationist leader Philippe Petain a traitor.\nMs Le Pen has said in the past that her father should \"no longer be able to speak in the name of the National Front\".\nA family feud on the French far-right\nLe Pen family feud in quotes\nFrom 'untouchables' to EU force", "date": "20 August 2015", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-34009901", "tags": "pen founder feud jean-marie le party expelled front leader national expels french france"}
