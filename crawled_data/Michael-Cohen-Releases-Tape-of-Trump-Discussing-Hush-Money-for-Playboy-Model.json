{"title": "Michael Cohen Releases Tape of Trump Discussing Hush Money for Playboy Model", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, escalated his dispute with the president on Tuesday by releasing a secret recording of a conversation in which Mr. Trump appears to have knowledge about hush money payments to a former Playboy model who said she had an affair with Mr. Trump.\nThe recording, which was broadcast by CNN, is sometimes muddled but provides details on payments to the former model, Karen McDougal. However, it does not definitively answer the question about whether Mr. Trump directed Mr. Cohen to make them in cash or by check just two months before the 2016 presidential election.\nMr. Cohen is heard telling Mr. Trump that he will need to set up a company to arrange the payments.\nMr. Trump then asked, \u201cWhat financing?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to pay,\u201d Mr. Cohen said.\nMr. Trump then appears to say, \u201cPay with cash.\u201d\nMr. Cohen then says, \u201cNo, no.\u201d\nThe word \u201ccheck\u201d is uttered, but it is not clear by whom, and the audio is then cut off.\nLanny J. Davis, a lawyer for Mr. Cohen and a longtime supporter of Bill and Hillary Clinton, told The New York Times on Tuesday night that Mr. Cohen released the tape because he is \u201con a new path \u2014 it\u2019s a reset button to tell the truth and to let the chips fall where they may.\u201d\n[Michael Cohen has said he would take a bullet for President Trump. Maybe not anymore. Read more.] \nMs. McDougal was paid $150,000 by The National Enquirer for her story in summer 2016. The tabloid, which has often given Mr. Trump favorable coverage, then did not publish the story. According to people close to Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump, the two men were discussing on the tape a second payment to The Enquirer that would continue to keep Ms. McDougal from speaking publicly about Mr. Trump.\nOn the recording, Mr. Trump shows some familiarity with a deal between Ms. McDougal and American Media Inc., the publisher of The Enquirer, and does not act as if he is only learning about it then. When The Times reported on the existence of the payment on Friday, Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, said the tape would prove \u201cexculpatory,\u201d indicating that the conversation was the first time that Mr. Trump had heard about the deal Ms. McDougal struck with A.M.I.\nOn the tape, Mr. Cohen raises the possibility of creating a separate company to buy the rights to Ms. McDougal\u2019s story from A.M.I.\n\u201cI need to open up a company for the transfer of all of that info regarding our friend David,\u201d Mr. Cohen is heard saying. David Pecker is the chairman of A.M.I.; he has acknowledged being \u201cpersonal friends\u201d with Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump.\nOn Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump complained on Twitter about the tape cutting off \u201cwhile I was presumably saying positive things.\u201d\nMr. Cohen, who had been considered one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most loyal personal aides and the keeper of many of his secrets, is under investigation by federal authorities in New York. Investigators are examining Mr. Cohen\u2019s role in making payments during the campaign to women who claimed they had sex with Mr. Trump and whether campaign finance laws were violated.\nAmerican Media, which has also drawn scrutiny from prosecutors over whether it ultimately engaged in an illegal coordinated campaign contribution with Mr. Cohen, did not respond to an email on Tuesday night asking whether it discussed selling the rights to Ms. McDougal\u2019s story to Mr. Trump.\nIn the fall, Mr. Cohen had set up a limited liability company in Delaware \u2014 Essential Consultants \u2014 to hide the deal he made to silence the pornographic film actress Stephanie Clifford about an affair she claims to have had with Mr. Trump around the same time of Ms. McDougal\u2019s alleged relationship.\nAs they discuss Ms. McDougal and A.M.I., Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen appear to be concerned that in leaving the rights to Ms. McDougal\u2019s story in A.M.I.\u2019s hands, they are ceding an uncomfortable level of control in trusting a tabloid publisher, even such a friendly one, with such a delicate story.\nMr. Cohen is heard saying, \u201cYou never know where that company \u2014 you never know where he\u2019s gonna be,\u201d to which Mr. Trump is heard raising the fear that \u201che gets hit by a truck.\u201d\nOn the recording, Mr. Cohen can also be heard describing efforts by The Times to unseal Mr. Trump\u2019s divorce records from his first marriage, to Ivana Trump. Mr. Cohen is heard telling Mr. Trump that they will fight the efforts. Mr. Trump ultimately prevailed over The Times and the records remained sealed.\nDespite the fact that the tape is not clear, Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers and Mr. Cohen\u2019s representatives have made completely different claims about what the recording demonstrates.\nAfter The Times\u2019s Friday report, Mr. Giuliani said that the president could be heard saying that the payment should be made with a check rather than cash so it could be properly documented. The audio is not that conclusive, but nor is it as clear as Mr. Cohen\u2019s representatives claim. They say it shows that Mr. Trump directed it be paid in cash.\n\u201cEverybody heard just now Donald Trump say the word \u2018cash\u2019 after Michael Cohen mentioned financing,\u201d Mr. Davis said on CNN after it broadcast the tape on Tuesday. \u201cWhatever spin Mr. Giuliani is trying to invent, it says cash.\u201d\nMr. Giuliani has acknowledged that the situation that Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen are primarily discussing on the tape is A.M.I.\u2019s $150,000 payment to Ms. McDougal.\nIn April, federal agents raided Mr. Cohen\u2019s home and residences. The search deeply unnerved the president, who has since increased his attacks on the Justice Department; the office of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III; and Mr. Cohen, who, in turn, has told associates he is willing to cooperate with the authorities. During the raid, federal agents obtained the recording, along with business records, emails and documents.\nMr. Trump, who has lately been wary of Mr. Cohen\u2019s willingness to cooperate with federal investigators, said on Saturday morning that Mr. Cohen\u2019s recording was \u201cperhaps illegal.\u201d\n\u201cInconceivable that the government would break into a lawyer\u2019s office (early in the morning) \u2014 almost unheard of,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cEven more inconceivable that a lawyer would tape a client \u2014 totally unheard of.\u201d", "date": "July 25, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/24/us/politics/trump-cohen-tape.html", "tags": "hush releases discussing playboy model heard tape \u201d trump cohen mcdougal money michael ms. \u2014"}
