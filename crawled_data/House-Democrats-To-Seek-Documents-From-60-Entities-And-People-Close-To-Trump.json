{"title": "House Democrats To Seek Documents From 60 Entities And People Close To Trump", "content": "Over 60 entities and individuals with close ties to President Donald Trump and his businesses will get document requests from the House Judiciary Committee on Monday, panel Chairman Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) said Sunday.\n\u201cThe Republicans spent two years shielding the president from any proper accountability. ...\u00a0It\u2019s our job to protect the rule of law,\u201d Nadler said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d\nTestimony by Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s longtime personal lawyer, to the House oversight committee last week yielded new leads for committee investigators to follow as they probe whether the president engaged in corruption, obstruction of justice and abuse of power.\u00a0\nNadler said some of the individuals receiving requests for documents will include people Cohen named at last week\u2019s hearing, including Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s eldest son, and Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg. According to two checks submitted to Congress, Trump Jr. and Weisselberg helped reimburse Cohen for payments he made to an adult film star to maintain her silence before the 2016 election about an alleged affair with Trump.\nNadler also said that officials who are currently serving or who have previously worked in the White House and the Department of Justice for the administration will be asked to provide information to the committee. These may include Don McGahn, the former White House counsel, and John Kelly, Trump\u2019s former chief of staff.\nKelly wrote an internal memo about how he had been \u201cordered\u201d to give Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law, a top-secret security clearance last year, overruling concerns from intelligence officials and the White House\u2019s top lawyer, The New York Times reported last week.\u00a0\nNadler said he believed such an order constituted an example of the president\u2019s \u201cabuse of power\u201d that his committee would like to know more about.\n\u201cLook, the president has the right to do a lot of things but he can\u2019t abuse his power in doing that,\u201d he said when asked Sunday about the Times report.\nThe New York Democrat has repeatedly expressed his view in recent months that Trump either clearly obstructed justice, or attempted doing so, by seeking to curtail special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into possible Trump campaign collusion with Russia during the 2016 presidential election.\nNadler reiterated his view on Sunday, saying it is \u201dvery clear that the president obstructed justice.\u201d\nBut Nadler \u2015 like other top Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) \u2015 continued to express reservations about opening impeachment proceedings against Trump.\n\u201dImpeachment is a long way down the road. We don\u2019t have the facts yet,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore you impeach somebody, you have to persuade the American public. ... You ought to persuade the opposition party voters, Trump voters, that you\u2019re not trying to reverse the result of the last election.\u201d", "date": "\n03/03/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-documents-jerry-nadler_n_5c7be348e4b0614614db294e", "tags": "people sunday democrats committee entities documents nadler close house trump seek \u201d last"}
