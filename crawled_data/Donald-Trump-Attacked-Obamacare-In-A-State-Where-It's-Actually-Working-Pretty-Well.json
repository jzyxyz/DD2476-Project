{"title": "Donald Trump Attacked Obamacare In A State Where It's Actually Working Pretty Well", "content": "Donald Trump has been bashing Obamacare a lot lately. This week, he did so in a state that\u2019s become a major focus of his presidential campaign \u2015 Michigan.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just been announced that Michigan residents are going to experience a massive double-digit premium hike,\u201d Trump said Monday during a speech in Warren, a working-class suburb north of Detroit. \u201cIt\u2019s been a disaster.\u201d\nThe crowd roared with approval \u2015 partly because you can\u2019t really go wrong denouncing Obamacare at a Trump rally, and partly, one assumes, because some Michiganders are genuinely angry about how the Affordable Care Act is playing out in their state.\nOverall, premiums for people buying coverage on their own, rather than through employers, are rising by 17 percent in Michigan \u2015 a double-digit increase, just as Trump said. Although the majority of consumers are eligible for tax credits that would offset the higher prices, others make too much money to qualify for financial assistance. If they can\u2019t switch plans, they\u2019ll pay more for their insurance next year.\nBut Michigan\u2019s market isn\u2019t melting down. Far from it. With open enrollment for 2017 underway, consumers shopping for coverage on healthcare.gov will find an array of plans, many of them relatively cheap even before subsidies kick in. Meanwhile, the number of Michiganders without coverage has plummeted to a historic low.\nThis says something important about the debate over health care, which has taken on a more prominent role as the presidential campaign nears its end. We tend to talk about Obamacare like it\u2019s one program, but it\u2019s really more like 51 different programs \u2015 one for each state, plus one for the District of Columbia. In some states, like Arizona, the insurance marketplaces for individual consumers look like actuarial train wrecks, and some residents are going to struggle as a result. In other states, like California, the marketplaces are functioning more or less as intended \u2015 and the law is achieving most of its primary goals.\nMichigan is a lot more like California than Arizona. In fact, it\u2019s a case study in how the law works when favorable conditions exist. And better still, it offers hints as to what those conditions are. \nIt\u2019s easy enough to assess the Affordable Care Act\u2019s impact\u00a0in Michigan. The law took full effect in early 2014, and over the next two years, the share of Michigan\u2019s population without health insurance fell from 11 percent to 6.5 percent. That\u2019s based on 2015 census data, so the percentage is probably even lower now. Whatever the case, that\u2019s a lot of people who now have access to health care and protection from sometimes crippling medical bills.\nThat development is hardly unique to Michigan. The ranks of the uninsured have fallen everywhere, particularly in states, like Michigan, that participated in Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion. But in Michigan, like every other state, there have also been trade-offs.\nThe new requirements on insurers \u2015 to ignore pre-existing conditions, and to sell policies with a full spread of \u201cessential benefits\u201d like mental health and maternity care \u2015 caused insurers to raise underlying premiums, or in some cases eliminate policies altogether. Subsidies offset the higher premiums, but not for everybody. In all likelihood, some of the Michiganders cheering on Trump this week were a few of the lucky people who had those old policies \u2015 and who remember, bitterly, President Barack Obama\u2019s promise that \u201cif you like your plan, you can keep it.\u201d\nThis \u201crate shock\u201d has been a source of anger since the law took full effect in 2014. The new wrinkle \u2015 which has given Trump an opening to focus on Obamacare these past two weeks \u2015 is this year\u2019s increases. Obamacare has basically been hit with a perfect storm. Insurers everywhere expected healthy people to sign up in greater numbers than they did. And a key program designed to protect insurers from losses in the program\u2019s early stages expires this year.\nAs a result, insurers across the country are raising prices and, in some highly publicized cases, pulling out of markets altogether. In Phoenix, premiums are rising by 145 percent. A 40-year-old non-smoker ineligible for subsidies there will pay $507 a month, one of the highest rates in the country.\nMichigan\u2019s insurers have seen some of these problems, too.\n\u201cWe expected the market to be bigger, with more people and more younger people than we enrolled,\u201d Rick Notter, director of the exchange business for Michigan Blue Cross Blue Shield, told me recently.\nThe state\u2019s insurers say they are particularly worried about \u201cpersistency\u201d \u2015 the extent to which people may be buying coverage during open enrollment or because of a qualifying life event like divorce, and then dropping it after getting a few expensive medical services.\n\u201cOne of the biggest challenges in this market is that individuals aren\u2019t staying enrolled for 12 months,\u201d said Marti Lolli, senior vice president for commercial markets at Priority Health. \u201dA lot of people are staying enrolled just for three or four months.\u201d\nBut while Michigan\u2019s insurers are raising rates this year, they aren\u2019t freaking out.\n\u201cWe\u2019re scheduled to break even in 2017, and 2016 was close to that,\u201d Lolli said. \u201cWe did not experience the kinds of losses they had elsewhere, not even close. We\u2019re on a good path and we think we can be in this for the long haul.\u201d\nThe offerings on the marketplace reflect this confidence. Nine different insurers plan to sell coverage in Michigan next year, according to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. And in most parts of the state, inexpensive policies remain easy to find. \nIn and around Detroit, for example, a 40-year-old non-smoker can buy the second-cheapest \u201csilver\u201d policy, which the law treats as its benchmark, for just $237 a month. (Silver policies cover 70 percent of a typical person\u2019s medical expenses.) That\u2019s almost exactly what it cost to get the second-cheapest silver plan in Detroit last year \u2015 and that\u2019s without the tax credits, available to people with low to medium incomes, that can make coverage much cheaper or nearly free.\nThis year\u2019s benchmark plan comes from Molina, a national insurer that has traditionally focused on low-income populations. Like most of the company\u2019s plans around the country, the benchmark Molina plan offers a \u201cnarrow network\u201d of doctors and providers. It also has a high deductible. But lower-income people get extra financial assistance to reduce the deductible, and the network includes well-regarded teaching hospitals like Harper University Hospital and Detroit Children\u2019s. Doctor supply doesn\u2019t seem to be a problem, either. The Huffington Post reached out to several physician practices on the official provider list, and each one confirmed that it was taking new Molina patients.\nAs for people who want smaller deductibles or more provider choices, they can choose policies that come with moderately higher premiums. Priority offers a silver-level HMO with a $2,500 deductible for $312 a month \u2015 and again, that\u2019s before subsidies on premiums and out-of-pocket costs. The plan\u2019s network includes every major teaching hospital in the area and, according to Lolli, the vast majority of physicians as well. Overall, Detroit-area residents can choose from 83 different plans, with roughly half the plans in the silver category that the majority of consumers use.\nAs in the rest of the country, Michigan has rural patches with fewer, largely more expensive options. People who don\u2019t get subsidies and stay with their current plans will pay more. But it\u2019s also not hard to find residents like Amy Lynn Smith, a Detroit-area freelance writer with diabetes who said the law is saving her hundreds of dollars a month in premiums.\n \u201cIt\u2019s a huge step forward,\u201d Smith told HuffPost. \u201cEven though rates are going up in 2017 I\u2019m still paying far less than I was before for the same comprehensive coverage.\u201d \nWhy is Michigan one of the states where Obamacare is having an easier time? In places like California, where Obamacare is working best, support from state officials has been a huge factor.\nThat appears to be the case in Michigan as well. Gov. Rick Snyder (R) is in some ways a throwback to a previous generation of Republicans \u2015 business-oriented pragmatists who reliably fell on the conservative side of economic policy, but who didn\u2019t hate the welfare state and who would work with Democrats to expand social programs if they saw it as a chance to help citizens at a reasonable cost.\nThat\u2019s exactly what Snyder did. When Obamacare became law, he reasoned that the state would benefit by making Medicaid available to all low-income residents, as the law envisioned, because the federal government would be picking up most of the cost. It would mean more people with insurance, yes, but it would also mean more money for the state and its businesses. Snyder wanted Michigan to run its own version of the law\u2019s marketplaces, because he figured state officials knew the local insurance markets well \u2015 and would be in a position to smooth the transition to a new health insurance system, with more widely available coverage.\nSnyder ran into resistance from conservative Republicans in the state legislature, and it took years of negotiation \u2015 and lobbying from consumer and corporate interests \u2015 \u00a0to win approval for the Medicaid expansion. He never did win the marketplace fight. But the Medicaid expansion has allowed hundreds of thousands of people to gain coverage. And Snyder and his allies probably helped stabilize the marketplaces by having Medicaid pick up some patients with expensive medical needs who would have otherwise driven up premiums if they were buying private coverage.\nAnother big factor in Michigan \u2015 again, common to the states where Obamacare is working best \u2015 seems to be the health care landscape that existed even before the law took effect. As Marianne Udow-Phillips, director of the Ann Arbor-based Center for Healthcare Research and Transformation, explained to me recently, local and predominantly nonprofit insurers like Blue Cross, HAP\u00a0and Priority dominate the state. The only national insurers that have thrived in Michigan are companies like Molina that specialize in insuring Medicaid patients and have done so for years.\nWhat the Michigan-based and Medicaid insurers have in common, Udow-Phillips said, is that both have a lot of experience constructing networks of physicians and hospitals that will keep costs down. She noted that Michigan generally hasn\u2019t had the sort of network problems seen in other states \u2015 where patients sometimes get hospital care and discover they have surprise bills because out-of-network doctors were part of their medical teams.\nA hidden factor in all of this, Udow-Phillips said, has been the influence of organized labor and its ability to demand good insurance for members.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always had health plans that had better networks than in most places,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen labor unions were really strong here, they insisted on good networks of providers. And they [insisted] upon reasonable prices too.\u201d\nIt also helps, Udow-Phillips says, that so many of Michigan\u2019s insurers are nonprofits with histories of citing the public good as part of their missions.\nYet another element of Michigan\u2019s success may be the way doctors and hospitals have responded to these demands \u2015 and the way they\u2019ve adapted in a market where the people paying for care (not just insurers, but employers and unions as well) have for years pushed for more efficient ways of delivering medical care.\n\u201cMichigan has been an innovative state for a long time,\u201d J. Mario Molina, physician and CEO of the eponymous insurance company, told HuffPost. \u201cIn some states, it\u2019s just ... let\u2019s churn through patients, see how much money we can make. This state, it\u2019s more sophisticated \u2015 for example, when it comes to working on quality. Doctors understand that part of their compensation will depend on whether they provide quality of care, not just lots of care.\u201d \nOf course, a functioning market in Michigan doesn\u2019t mean much for consumers in places like Arizona, North Carolina or Tennessee, where the problems are far more severe and may yet get worse \u2015 resulting in higher prices for some people, and fewer choices for nearly everyone. On Wednesday, yet another national insurer, Anthem, warned that it will start scaling back its presence \u2015 just as Aetna and UnitedHealth have \u2015 if it doesn\u2019t see better returns from its exchange products.\nAnd even in Michigan, insurers say, Obamacare needs work. The Department of Health and Human Services recently announced changes to the law\u2019s \u201cspecial enrollment periods,\u201d which were designed to make sure people could still get coverage after a major life event but which people may be exploiting in order to buy insurance only after they get sick.\u00a0Michigan\u2019s insurers cited these changes as an improvement, but they say the program needs further revisions \u2015 particularly when it comes to a formula under which the plans that have relatively healthy customers subsidize the plans that don\u2019t.\nIn theory, these sorts of reforms should not be difficult to enact. But some of the most important ones require legislative action, and Republicans in Congress have refused to discuss changes short of outright repeal.\nThey say that\u2019s because the program is fundamentally broken. It\u2019s the same argument Trump makes. But Michigan is one of the states that prove otherwise \u2015 that Obamacare can work, especially if public officials will support it.\nEditor\u2019s note: Donald Trump regularly\nincites\npolitical violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe,\nracist, misogynist and birther who has\nrepeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims \u2014 1.6 billion members of an entire religion \u2014 from\nentering the U.S.", "date": "\n11/02/2016", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-obamacare-michigan_n_5817f34ae4b0390e69d23f18", "tags": "like working well \u201c obamacare insurers trump attacked \u2015 donald state actually michigan pretty law"}
