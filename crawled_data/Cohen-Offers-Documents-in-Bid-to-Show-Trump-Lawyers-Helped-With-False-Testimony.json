{"title": "Cohen Offers Documents in Bid to Show Trump Lawyers Helped With False Testimony", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Michael D. Cohen on Wednesday provided new documents to the House Intelligence Committee that he said illustrated changes made at the request of President Trump\u2019s lawyers to a knowingly false written statement that he delivered to Congress in 2017, according to three people familiar with the matter.\nMr. Cohen, in what was expected to be his last visit to Capitol Hill, brought multiple drafts of his 2017 statement along with emails with Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers about its drafting, hoping to back up claims that he made last week at an open hearing before the House Oversight and Reform Committee. In that session, Mr. Cohen testified that there were \u201cchanges made, additions\u201d to the original written statement, including about the length of negotiations over a proposed Trump Tower project in Moscow during the 2016 presidential campaign.\nIt was not immediately clear how many changes were made by Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers, including Jay Sekulow, or how drastic those changes were. Two of the people familiar with the documents and Mr. Cohen\u2019s testimony, who were not authorized to speak publicly about the closed-door session, said that at least some of the changes appeared to play down the knowledge of the president\u2019s eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump, about the project.\nAt the least, the exchange between Mr. Cohen and the president\u2019s lawyers suggests that the lawyers had detailed knowledge of what he was going to tell Congress. Mr. Cohen said last week that though Mr. Trump did not explicitly direct him to lie, he \u201cmade clear to me\u201d through his actions that \u201che wanted me to lie.\u201d\nOther people familiar with the discussions that took place at the time of Mr. Cohen\u2019s original testimony said that it was Mr. Cohen himself who wrote that the Moscow project ended before the Iowa caucuses in January 2016, when Mr. Trump was a candidate.\nThat statement turned out to be false, and in November 2018, Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress. In fact, he said, discussions about the project had gone on much longer and Mr. Trump had greater involvement than he had led the congressional committees to believe.\nThe documents were delivered by Mr. Cohen as he appeared for yet another session with congressional lawmakers investigating Mr. Trump, his campaign and his businesses \u2014 his last before he reports for his prison sentence this spring. Lawmakers on the Intelligence Committee also pressed Mr. Cohen on Wednesday and in an earlier session last week for more details on a range of claims he made publicly, including whether he sought out or was offered a potential pardon.\nCNN first reported that Mr. Cohen had produced the documents on Wednesday. He had alluded to them before the Oversight and Reform Committee, specifically mentioning Mr. Sekulow, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyers, as someone who proposed alterations to his 2017 statement.\n\u201cThere were changes made, additions \u2014 Jay Sekulow, for one,\u201d Mr. Cohen said in that hearing. \u201cThere were several changes that were made including how we were going to handle that message, which was \u2014 the message of course being the length of time that the Trump Tower Moscow project stayed and remained alive.\u201d\nMr. Sekulow disputed Mr. Cohen\u2019s testimony last week. In a statement, he said that the testimony \u201cthat attorneys for the president edited or changed his statement to Congress to alter the duration of the Trump Tower Moscow negotiations is completely false.\u201d On Wednesday, he referred to his previous statement when asked about Mr. Cohen\u2019s documents.\nThe people familiar with the discussions that took place at the time of Mr. Cohen\u2019s original testimony said that Mr. Cohen\u2019s lawyers had signed off on all of the changes proposed by Mr. Trump\u2019s legal team. They also said that Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers had at the time no indication that the dates Mr. Cohen cited in the statement were inaccurate.\nMr. Cohen\u2019s team shared his proposed statement with Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers because at the time they had a formal agreement to work together to defend the president and Mr. Cohen.\nSpeaking with reporters after Wednesday\u2019s session, Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the Intelligence Committee\u2019s chairman, acknowledged only that Mr. Cohen had provided the committee \u201cadditional documents,\u201d noting that it had found him to be fully cooperative.\n\u201cThere may be additional documents that he still has to offer and his cooperation with our committee continues,\u201d Mr. Schiff said. The chairman had previously indicated that he planned to make a transcript of Mr. Cohen\u2019s testimony public at some unspecified future date.\nRepublicans on the committee did not speak with reporters after the interview concluded. And in a brief statement, Mr. Cohen said he would be willing to provide additional information to the committee if it requested it.\nThe new details punctuated \u2014 somewhat quietly \u2014 an extraordinary and explosive week of congressional testimony from Mr. Cohen, once one of Mr. Trump\u2019s closest aides. The peak came last Wednesday, when Mr. Cohen took the witness stand publicly before the Oversight and Reform Committee to accuse Mr. Trump of racism, bullying and outright fraud. In each venue, Republicans repeatedly pointed to Mr. Cohen\u2019s own confessed crimes and his record of lying to Congress and the public in an attempt to discredit his testimony against the president.\nStill, the public session and his private interviews with the House and Senate Intelligence Committees in the days surrounding it are certain to provide newly ascendant Democrats in the House with fresh investigative leads as they scrutinize Mr. Trump\u2019s circles. The House Intelligence Committee is scheduled to hold a public hearing next week with Felix Sater, another Trump associate involved in the Moscow project.", "date": "March 6, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/us/politics/trump-documents-cohen.html", "tags": "made false testimony bid show committee documents helped trump cohen statement lawyers changes offers"}
