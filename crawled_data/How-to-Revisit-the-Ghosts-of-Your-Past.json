{"title": "How to Revisit the Ghosts of Your Past", "content": "We all have moments from our past that gnaw at us \u2014 a regret, an unanswered question, an old tragedy. We obsess over these moments when we can\u2019t sleep, or when we need a good cry. But most days, we try to ignore these unwelcome memories, pushing them aside so we can buy groceries or go to work or do new things that we won\u2019t regret. Our poor choices and hurt feelings fade to the background, until another quiet moment beckons them to come pick at us again.\nIn this way, a single moment can pester us for years and years \u2014 unless we return to the past and confront it head on.\nThis is something I think about a lot because I\u2019m a producer for the podcast \u201cHeavyweight,\u201d which is about exactly that. The show, created by Gimlet Media, is hosted by Jonathan Goldstein, formerly of \u201cThis American Life\u201d and \u201cWireTap\u201d on CBC Radio. In each episode, we take a moment from someone\u2019s life that\u2019s unresolved. Then, we go on a quest with them to try and make things right. We\u2019ve revisited a disputed broken arm, a sorority drama and a suitcase of old love letters. We\u2019ve helped people apologize, confront their bullies and rebuild frayed relationships.\nIt\u2019s one thing to try to fix your past with the help of a well-intentioned but comically awkward podcast host, but perhaps you\u2019d rather sort through your regrets on your own schedule, without letting a stranger with a microphone into your living room. In that case, I have some tips for you.\nThe moments we address on the show are often decades old. A lot of times that\u2019s for the best, because the people involved have grown up and have had the space and time to clarify their feelings. For example, when Christina was in 11th grade, her foster mother made her quit playing basketball. After that, she felt like her life never got back on course. And so she always wanted to ask her foster mother why she made her quit. By the time Christina actually asks this question, she\u2019s 42. The intervening decades have allowed her to understand her feelings in a way that she couldn\u2019t at 16. She\u2019s able to hear her foster mother\u2019s response and take it in without shutting down.\nOften the solution to a problem \u2014 past or present \u2014 is simply to say what you\u2019re feeling. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve been trying to do more frequently. But saying what you\u2019re feeling is often slippery and terrifying; mostly I\u2019ve gotten into the habit of saying what I felt at one time, a while ago, and explaining what I want to clear up now, years later. For example, after I started working on \u201cHeavyweight,\u201d I called my mom to apologize for a time that I was a brat in high school. I also texted my childhood best friend to thank her for consoling me when I didn\u2019t get into the school play. I can see how such a thing would seem insane, but so far, everyone has reacted positively.\nEven if it feels odd \u2014 or maybe especially if it feels odd \u2014 remember: It\u2019s never too late to say something, once you figure out what that something is. And if you\u2019re waiting for the perfect moment to fix things, that moment might never come, so you might as well pick an imperfect moment. Like, say, right now.\nHere is a thing that happens to us often on \u201cHeavyweight\u201d: Someone sends a message saying something like, \u201cHey, I\u2019d love to talk to you about that thing that happened 20 years ago that was very emotional for me,\u201d and the recipient does not respond. Here are the top three reasons the message writers think they haven\u2019t received a response:\n1. This person hates them.\n2. This person doesn\u2019t want to talk about that thing from 20 years ago.\n3. This person is creeped out by being contacted after so long.\nSometimes those things are true! But unless the person you\u2019re writing says that outright, you have no way of knowing for sure. Here are three other reasons people don\u2019t respond:\n1. They are busy and this thing from 20 years ago is not as emotional for them, so they just haven\u2019t gotten around to answering.\n2. The message was filtered into a spam folder and they didn\u2019t see it.\n3. They need some time to think through whether this is something they want to revisit.\nIn one \u201cHeavyweight\u201d episode, Jesse wants to talk to the driver of the car that hit and nearly killed him. He wants to tell the driver, Christian, that he\u2019s O.K. We tried to get in touch with Christian again and again for three months and heard nothing back. It seemed like the conversation just wasn\u2019t going to happen. And then, Christian wrote us to say he\u2019d been thinking about it, and he wanted to talk.\nIf you reach out to someone from your past and don\u2019t hear back, don\u2019t assume the worst. I suggest you don\u2019t assume anything. Be patient and try again if this thing is still nagging at you in a few months.\nThe people on our show are often a little embarrassed by the moments that have stuck with them. They have the sense that, because it was something small or long ago, they should have gotten over it by now. But they haven\u2019t gotten over it \u2014 it\u2019s bothered them for years, and that\u2019s a valid feeling no matter the magnitude of the event. \nThe world, as it turns out, is not a competition to experience the saddest possible thing. We\u2019ve done stories about very big things, like being on a jury in a death penalty case, and we\u2019ve done stories about small things, like getting kicked out of a pizza parlor. I don\u2019t think that one delegitimizes the other.\n\nThe past is murky territory, and I am not a licensed therapist, just someone who talks to a lot of people about their lives. I recommend consulting a professional who has a broader context for who you are and what\u2019s right for you.\nSome stories don\u2019t have a clean ending, and the other person involved can\u2019t or won\u2019t give you what you need. And when that happens, you have to find a way to live without it.\nThese stories usually don\u2019t turn into episodes for our show, because when you\u2019re trying to build a 40-minute narrative arc, it\u2019s not very satisfying to end on, \u201cEvery time we tried to call, they hung up on us,\u201d or, \u201cWe decided not to even reach out to this person because they were abusive.\u201d\nBut beyond the world of \u201cHeavyweight,\u201d many stories like these can have endings. And an ending doesn\u2019t need to be tied up in a neat package with credits and a theme song for it to be a happy one.", "date": "May 13, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/13/smarter-living/how-to-revisit-the-ghosts-of-your-past.html", "tags": "like us something past things thing revisit \u201d years ghosts \u2014"}
