But in an interview from last year that\u2019s now getting recirculated, she pretty much told us everything we needed to know about the fate of her beloved character, Daenerys Targaryen.\n(Spoilers for Season 8, Episode 5 of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d below.)\nIn the penultimate episode of the series, \u201cThe Bells,\u201d which aired Sunday, Dany finally proved the Targaryen apple doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree. Midway through the episode, she went full Mad Queen on King\u2019s Landing, burning the entire city down with her dragon, Drogon \u2014 despite the Lannister army surrendering to her.\nIt was an upsetting turn for a strong and sympathetic female character whom many believed would emerge as the series\u2019 hero.\nBut in retrospect, it seems Clarke hinted months ago that her character would flip her lid, thanks to an \u201cEntertainment Tonight\u201d clip from September.\nAt last year\u2019s Emmys, an \u201cET\u201d reporter asked Clarke, Jacob Anderson (Grey Worm) and Nathalie Emmanuel (Missandei) on the red carpet if they\u2019d filmed their final scenes yet and \u2014 most importantly \u2014 \u201cAre you happy how things ended?\u201d\nIn response, Clarke nervously laughed, and with a pained expression sarcastically said, \u201cBest season ever!\u201d\nAs fans of the show flocked to Twitter Monday to express their discontent with \u201cThe Bells,\u201d the clip was certainly in heavy rotation.\nAlthough the series\u2019 showrunners, David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, did suggest in a\u00a0behind-the-scenes clip\u00a0that they\u2019ve been foreshadowing this end for the freakin\u2019 Protector of the Seven Kingdoms for quite a while, the Unburnt\u2019s actions felt like a burn to the audience.\nIn this very short final season of the epic HBO hit, Dany\u2019s character development \u2014 which involves grief and loss devolving into rage-fueled insanity \u2014 has felt rushed and unearned, making her unraveling feel... well, disappointing.\nBut even if the Breaker of Chains has broken our hearts, it\u2019s nice to know that Clarke herself is still a queen.", "date": "\n05/13/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/emilia-clarke-game-of-thrones-interview_n_5cd989e1e4b0b0e70ab39ac9", "tags": "us \u2018 game hate ending character clarke episode clip season series \u201d emilia tried warn thrones \u2014 daenerys"}
