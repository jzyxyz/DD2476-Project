{"title": "China reforms: One-child policy to be relaxed", "content": "China is to relax its policy of restricting most couples to having only a single child, state media say.\nIn future, families will be allowed two children if one parent is an only child, the Xinhua news agency said.\nThe proposal follows this week's meeting of a key decision-making body of the governing Communist Party.\nOther reforms include the abolition of \"re-education through labour\" camps and moves to boost the role of the private sector in the economy.\nThe BBC's Celia Hatton, in Beijing, says most of the changes have already been tested in parts of the country. \nOfficials announce their plans well in advance to gain the consensus they need, she adds. \nThe latest announcements are contained in a 22,000-word document released three days after the Third Plenum meeting of the Communist leadership in Beijing.\nTraditionally reforms are expected from the Third Plenum, because new leaders are seen as having had time to consolidate power. President Xi Jinping took office last year.\nThe one-child policy would be \"adjusted and improved step by step to promote 'long-term balanced development of the population in China'\", Xinhua said.\nChina introduced its one-child policy at the end of the 1970s to curb rapid population growth.\nBut correspondents say the policy has become increasingly unpopular and that leaders fear the country's ageing population will both reduce the labour pool and exacerbate elderly care issues.\nBy 2050, more than a quarter of the population will be over 65. \nThe one-child policy has on the whole been strictly enforced, though some exceptions already exist, including for ethnic minorities.\nIn some cities, both parents must be only children in order to be allowed to have a second child.\nIn the countryside, families are allowed to have two children if the first is a girl. \nCouples who flout the rules can face heavy fines, or possibly lose their property or their jobs.\nRights groups say the law has meant some women being coerced into abortions, which Beijing denies.\nThe traditional preference for boys has also created a gender imbalance as some couples opt for sex-selective abortions. \nBy the end of the decade, demographers say China will have 24 million \"leftover men\" who, because of China's gender imbalance, will not be able to find a wife.\nMost of the elderly in China are still cared for by relatives, and only children from single-child parents face what is known as the 4-2-1 phenomenon.\nWhen the child reaches working age, he or she could have to care for two parents and four grandparents in retirement. \nOn Tuesday, when the Third Plenum ended, China's leaders also promised that the free market would play a bigger role, and farmers would have greater property rights over their land.\nState firms will be required to pay larger dividends to the government, while private firms will be given a greater role in the economy.\nThere will be greater liberalisation in both interest rates and the free convertibility of the yuan. More overseas investment will be allowed.\nThere will also be an increase in the number of smaller banks and financial institutions funded by private capital.\nXinhua said the decision to do away with the \"re-education through labour\" camps was \"part of efforts to improve human rights and judicial practices\".\nChina's leaders had previously said they wanted to reform the system.\nThe network of camps created half a century ago holds tens of thousands of inmates. \nPolice panels have the power to sentence offenders to years in camps without trial. \nOther reforms announced on Friday include a reduction in the number of crimes subject to the death penalty.", "date": "15 November 2013", "href": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-24957303", "tags": "policy leaders china relaxed allowed say reforms child camps children population one-child"}
