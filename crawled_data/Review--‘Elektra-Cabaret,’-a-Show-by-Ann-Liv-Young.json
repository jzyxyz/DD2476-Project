{"title": "Review: \u2018Elektra Cabaret,\u2019 a Show by Ann Liv Young", "content": "Moments after Ann Liv Young\u2019s \u201cElektra Cabaret\u201d began at Joe\u2019s Pub at the Public Theater on Wednesday, she interrupted the show, smack in the middle of belting out Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s power ballad \u201c1+1.\u201d \u201cThis monitor,\u201d she said darkly, \u201cis way, way, way too loud.\u201d\nThe show started over.\nSuch disruptions in a program by Ms. Young, the provocative choreographer and performance artist, are commonplace, but in this hourlong work, a companion to her forthcoming \u201cElektra,\u201d the do-over was a rare occurrence. A highly structured piece intended to appear on the ragged side, \u201cElektra\u201d is based on the text by Sophocles and relies on Ms. Young\u2019s usual tools: ravaged emotions; pop music in which lyrics become the poetic through-line; and dancing, both flamboyant and aggressive.\nThis transformation of a Greek myth into a contemporary tale also features Lovey Guerrero, Ms. Young\u2019s daughter, who sings and dances, looking like a miniature doppelg\u00e4nger of her mother. Lovey, 7, did, for the record, leave the stage for most of the bawdier moments, including some nudity, simulated masturbation ... you get the picture.\nAfter a fiery rendition of Kanye West\u2019s \u201cBlack Skinhead,\u201d the characters were introduced via voice-over: Klytemnestra (Bailey Nolan), Elektra\u2019s mother, whose \u201clack of self-awareness is staggering\u201d; Elektra (Ms. Young), consumed by fantasies of revenge after her mother murders her father, King Agamemnon; Elektra\u2019s sister Chrysothemis (Vanessa Soudan), who has crippling panic attacks and whose duet with a pogo stick is a highlight; and Orestes (Charley Parden), recently returned from exile.\nLovey Guerrero, with streaks of white on her face, plays the ghost of Iphigenia \u2014 Elektra\u2019s sacrificed sister \u2014 and Marissa Mickelberg is the chorus. It\u2019s a charismatic crew in head-to-toe denim. The lyrics of Phil Collins\u2019s \u201cIn the Air Tonight\u201d \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s all been a pack of lies\u201d \u2014 resonate as the tableau comes to life. Ms. Young angrily swirls a rainbow ribbon wand as Lovey hops from side to side. As the songs progress, including Gloria Estefan\u2019s \u201cConga,\u201d which leads to a glorious hip-shaking ensemble dance that moves throughout the space, and Eminem\u2019s \u201cThe Monster,\u201d the tension increases: Klytemnestra must meet her fate.\n\u201cElektra Cabaret\u201d is entertaining, yet Ms. Young, in this raw deconstruction, manages to sneak in some grimness. Betrayal is everywhere, and the more Ms. Young reveals Elektra\u2019s inner monster, the more she shows an independent, outspoken woman. In other words, she\u2019s found herself in Greek mythology.", "date": "April 27, 2015", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/28/arts/dance/review-elektra-cabaret-a-show-by-ann-liv-young.html", "tags": "liv mother \u2018 young ann show way cabaret elektra \u201d side lovey ms. review \u2014"}
