They like to march between the shouting students and the masked anti-fascists, waving to onlookers and hoping to catch someone\u2019s eye long enough to exchange a smile.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Grannies,\u201d shouted a voice from a third-story window as the demonstration wound its way through Vienna\u2019s Fifth District last month. \u201cLook! The Grannies!\u201d\nThey are the Grannies Against the Right, dozens of women from a generation that watched their mothers suffer the fallout of World War II and helped create democracy in Austria.\nNow, freed from the burdens of raising their families and working to support them, they are galvanizing protests against Austria\u2019s shift to the right under the conservative-nationalist government of Chancellor Sebastian Kurz.\nThey are even aiming to form an international \u201cresistance\u201d against the right wing and extremists across Europe and beyond, the Grannies declared at an annual meeting last month.\n\u201cWe are angry about their policies,\u201d said Monika Salzer, 71 and a grandmother of three. She founded the group on Facebook in November 2017 amid concern over the return of a far-right party to government. Last year, she registered the Grannies as an official organization in Austria, and it now counts 300 members, with branches across Austria and Germany and thousands of followers over social media.\nThe Grannies\u2019 list of grievances is long: cuts to women\u2019s programs; discrimination against women, who receive no pension compensation for time taken off to raise children; the demonization of refugees and minorities in general; and an overall lack of empathy in the political discourse.\n\u201cThey want to destroy everything we have built up over the past 50 years,\u201d Ms. Salzer said of Mr. Kurz\u2019s coalition of conservatives and the far-right Freedom Party, which is part of the government for the second time in 20 years.\nThe last time the Freedom Party joined the government, in 2000, howls of protest went up across Europe and tens of thousands of Austrians took to the streets. The reaction after Mr. Kurz\u2019s government was sworn in during December 2017 was more muted.\nThe regular Thursday demonstrations began only in October, by which time the Grannies were organized. The Grannies haven\u2019t missed a march since, but with the political opposition weakened for the moment, the protests have had limited influence, said Martin Dolezal, a political scientist at the University of Salzburg.\n\u201cThe Grannies have received a lot of attention because of their age \u2014 they stand out in the largely younger crowd and they are well connected,\u201d Mr. Dolezal said. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t overemphasize their influence.\u201d\nStill, precisely because of their age, their presence serves as a reminder of past horrors born of intolerance and of the democratic gains that the Grannies want to preserve.\nAlthough their numbers fluctuate from demonstration to demonstration, depending largely on whether they are needed to help care for their grandchildren, the Grannies have become a recognized political force.\nFor Irene Haider, who joined with the group for a demonstration on International Women\u2019s Day last month, the Grannies\u2019 age made them not just unusual, but also important.\n\u201cIt\u2019s great that older women are making their political voice heard,\u201d said Ms. Haider, 48. Without having to be asked, she took one of a dozen white signs stashed in a shopping cart brought to each demonstration.\nThat spirit of openness defines the group, which despite its name, welcomes anyone, regardless of gender or age, who supports its opposition to discrimination and far-right ideology. Nonpartisanship is important.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want a seat in Parliament, we don\u2019t want to become chancellor,\u201d said Susanne Scholl, 69, a former correspondent with the national broadcaster ORF who is expecting her first grandchild this year. \u201cWe want the social, democratic principles of our country that we were raised in to exist for our children and grandchildren.\u201d\nAt its general meeting last month, the group established a European-wide branch, with an eye toward elections for the European Parliament in May, and changed its name into English for broader appeal.\nThe Grannies also addressed one of the problems that has shadowed them since the beginning: a misunderstanding among some members about their mission.\n\u201cWe had to make clear we are not a handicraft or knitting club,\u201d Ms. Scholl said. This, despite adopting the suggestion that the Grannies take over the cat-eared \u201cpussy hat\u201d beanies that had become the signature fashion item of the 2017 women\u2019s marches in the United States. But not just in pink.\n\u201cWe decided that we needed brighter colors,\u201d Ms. Salzer said, laughing. \u201cAt our age, we are beyond pink.\u201d\nHeinz-Christian Strache, the Freedom Party leader and Mr. Kurz\u2019s deputy, gave the group an inadvertent lift at a political rally this year in the town of Ried. Wearing lederhosen and gripping a mug of beer, he extolled the government\u2019s success in making the country less attractive to asylum-seekers and unraveling some of the benefits that flourished under center-left governments.\nHe also took a swipe at the demonstrators.\n\u201cOn Thursday again we\u2019ll see these so-called Thursday demos, along with the Grannies, the Grannies Against the Right,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cThey can march around the ring as long as they want, until they are so dizzy \u2014 dizzier then they already are \u2014 that they fall down.\u201d\nMs. Salzer and Ms. Scholl were delighted. \u201cEveryone is talking about us,\u201d Ms. Salzer said. \u201cEven the vice chancellor.\u201d\nAt a march down one of Vienna\u2019s main shopping streets on International Women\u2019s Day, about 15 of the Grannies took their place in the center of the demonstrators. They waved to two women watching from the sidewalk, then pulled a couple of \u201cGrannies Against the Right\u201d signs from the shopping cart and asked them to join.\nLaughing, Ebru Uzun, 26, and Sabine Schwaighofer, 49, accepted, and joined the group for the march.\n\u201cIt sends an important signal to the conservatives,\u201d said Ms. Uzun, 26. \u201cEveryone has a granny; they play a role in connecting a family, they are there for everyone.\u201d\nMs. Schwaighofer nodded in agreement, saying, \u201cGrannies are unifiers, and even though society wants to see them as apolitical, they are succeeding in making themselves into a political force.\u201d", "date": "April 28, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/28/world/europe/austria-grannies-against-right.html", "tags": "austria \u2018 grannies political \u201d women populists ms. voices last group rise new government"}
