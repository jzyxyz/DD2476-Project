{"title": "Parkland: A Year After the School Shooting That Was Supposed to Change Everything", "content": "PARKLAND, Fla. \u2014 The name \u201cParkland\u201d has become a shorthand for the tragedy that many hoped would mark the beginning of the end of school massacres.\nBut ask the survivors of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in more quiet moments about the awful year since last Feb. 14, and they tell you a different, more personal story. About innocence lost. Dreams undone. Grief delayed.\nThere\u2019s the boy who took five bullets to protect his classmates. A hero, the headlines proclaimed. He wanted to be a professional soccer player. \u201cNow I don\u2019t do anything,\u201d he said.\nThere\u2019s the young woman who tells people about her best friend, because if she calls him her boyfriend, it doesn\u2019t seem sufficient to convey what they were. Soul mate: That\u2019s what he\u2019d told her she was to him. Told her before he died. \nAnd there are the famous faces, the students everyone thinks they know, who on a recent morning stood at a nearby elementary school where a local charity quietly unveiled a mural, the last of 17 community service projects created to honor each of the victims. David Hogg, the one who went on CNN and dared adults to act like one, lay on a basketball court and painted in a hibiscus flower. Emma Gonz\u00e1lez, the one who \u201ccalled B.S.\u201d on politicians who weren\u2019t serious about gun control, crouched barefoot before the wall, cut out a paper stencil and sang along to the Beatles\u2019 song, \u201cHere Comes The Sun.\u201d\nTo think of them, and of this upscale suburban high school, as mere symbols of tragedy ignores the complicated tapestry of sadness, fear and defiance that is now forever part of it \u2014 and will be long after the last of these students graduate.\n[Read about the young lives lost since Parkland and where gun control and school safety stand today.]\nIn a series of interviews, nine members of the Stoneman Douglas community \u2014 students, parents, police, teachers \u2014 reflected on the past 12 months.\nThey did not want to relive that day. They did not want to argue about politics. They did not want to talk about the gunman\u2019s pending trial for capital murder.\nThis is what they wanted to do: mourn.\nIn all the activity of the past year, the March for Our Lives rally in Washington, the tour across the country registering voters, the investigations, the hearings, finishing senior year, getting into college \u2014 some said they hadn\u2019t had time to take the measure of what they had lost. As Jammal Lemy, 21, a Stoneman Douglas alumnus-turned-activist explained it, \u201cWe just had so much going on.\u201d\nThese are their stories, in their own words.\nThe five bullet wounds he took as he barricaded a classroom door to protect other students have healed, remarkably. But his recovery is far from over. And the prospect of being asked to testify in court looms in the future.\nI haven\u2019t gone back to school because I haven\u2019t seen a change. The security failed. They need to put in metal detectors. I am being home-schooled. But I would like to go to another school someday.\nPeople ask me what happened, what made me do what I did. I say I have always been strong.\nThe best moment for me was when I was able to walk by myself. The doctor told me, \u201cYou can walk a little now, without crutches.\u201d So one day I was home and thought, \u201cO.K., I can do this.\u201d I stood up and started limping. I walked into a room and my grandpa and my grandma and my mom and dad were there, and they burst out crying.\nI was proud of myself. I had thought maybe I wouldn\u2019t walk again. But I went to physical therapy every day. Now I just have to get my strength back. I can\u2019t even lift weights yet.\nMy life is not normal. It will never be like before. I used to get out of school and go play soccer. All I wanted was to play soccer professionally. I played forward. Now I don\u2019t do anything.\nToday I gave a deposition in the criminal case. The defense attorneys asked me about the death penalty. I said I\u2019m against it. I\u2019ve always thought that, because that is a capital sin. I am not God to take someone\u2019s life.\nNow a sophomore, she was inside the freshman building where the shooting took place. Her lab partner, Alyssa Alhadeff, was killed. So were two of her creative-writing classmates. During the interview, loud squawks from birds flying overhead made her jumpy.\nWhen I was in seventh grade, a teacher told us Parkland was a bubble. She said, \u201cSomeday, something bad\u2019s going to happen here, and the bubble\u2019s going to burst.\u201d I remember I kept thinking about that afterward. Like, wow, she was right. I don\u2019t feel safe anywhere anymore.\nI have PTSD. The hardest part are sudden noises. Fourth of July, I was at camp, and I wasn\u2019t expecting fireworks to go off, but they did. I had a panic attack. In school, a few freshmen have tried to pull pranks on us. They drop textbooks and film our reactions. We have monthly code-red drills. I\u2019ve skipped probably three of them. It\u2019s a constant reminder, every time, of the shooting.\nMe and my three best friends, we\u2019re the only ones that understand each other. One day they released a bunch of video footage from the shooting. We watched it together. Every time something gets put out there, people get very upset, but people need to see it.\nThe March for Our Lives in Washington was probably one of the coolest experiences of my life. We met Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi. I got to make a bunch of new friends. I wish I had never had those opportunities, though.\nWe\u2019re not all loud activists. A lot of us want to go back and finish our high school career the best we can. For college, I want to go to Ireland, where my parents are from, because I just don\u2019t want to do four more years of schooling here. I really don\u2019t like how divided this country is. In Ireland, there\u2019s no guns.\nThe Coral Springs police officers \u2014 who have been friends for more than 25 years \u2014 were among the first emergency personnel to enter the freshman building. Their counterparts at the Broward Sheriff\u2019s Office were criticized for failing to try to confront the gunman.\nLIEUTENANT MAZZEI: What we had to walk into, what we lived through, what we saw \u2014 it was overwhelming. When you\u2019re in there, you don\u2019t realize the magnitude of it. Then, obviously, sleep became an issue. I went to go fishing, and it was too much down time. I just remember a lot of sighing that day.\nThere was a day of healing at the park for emergency medical workers and families. They had questions for us that they could not answer: \u201cWho was the last person to see my loved one?\u201d\nCAPTAIN MOCK: It helped me, having conversations with kids and teachers that I couldn\u2019t have in the building. \nLIEUTENANT MAZZEI: Not a single day goes by that you don\u2019t think of some aspect of that day. I didn\u2019t drive by the school for a while after.\nCAPTAIN MOCK: I graduated from Douglas, class of \u201993. Wow, I have so many great memories there. You look at it different now.\nLIEUTENANT MAZZEI: We went to a sergeant\u2019s house to hang out. We just sat there and talked about it for hours, about what people saw, so the wives and husbands could understand everything. Many of us thought we were getting into a gunfight and weren\u2019t sure we were all coming out.\nThe funerals were tough. Two, three a day. One thing I was really impressed by was when the kids did the walkouts.\nCAPTAIN MOCK: The work never stopped. We never got that break to reflect. But there were many venues for people to get things off their chest. We\u2019ve had meetings, depositions and hearings. In the end, the entire truth is coming out.\nThe 2017 Stoneman Douglas graduate co-founded the March for Our Lives organization after the shooting, though he is not among the group\u2019s well-known leaders. He left college to help with merchandising, but became the organization\u2019s creative director after he designed a T-shirt that could be scanned with a cellphone to register someone to vote.\nI still haven\u2019t grieved. We just had so much going on. I don\u2019t want to think of the day my life changed. Thursday is going to be like a train: It\u2019s all going to hit.\nWhen you\u2019re on the road, people look at you like a leader. It\u2019s physically exhausting, and you don\u2019t want to burn out. We toured 60-plus cities in 60 days. We\u2019ve seen the high and low of America. It forces a lot of soul-searching. Almost every day I think to myself, \u201cWow, look where we\u2019ve come.\u201d It was my first time being away from my family for an extended period of time. Before, I had been on an airplane maybe three times.\nI created T-shirts with QR codes for people to register to vote. We told people we want all the kids in the country to be wearing these shirts, and we had people tell us, \u201cYou can\u2019t. You\u2019ve got to have realistic hopes and dreams.\u201d Well, we have lofty goals! I was at a concert, and I saw a random person wearing this T-shirt. Those are the small victories. We had the largest youth turnout in 25 years \u2014 but it was still only 31 percent.\nI left college because you have to choose what\u2019s more important. I want to use my talents and abilities to change the world somehow. That\u2019s what I want to be remembered for, more than a grade-point average.\nShe\u2019s a senior whose boyfriend, Joaquin Oliver, known as Guac, was killed in the shooting, months before he was expected to graduate. Only in December did she take what she considered the first step toward healing: planting a memorial garden at the school to commemorate the lives lost. She keeps the flowers Joaquin gave her last Valentine\u2019s Day\u2014his \u201clast act of love,\u201d she calls them\u2014 in a vase. \nAfter graduation, I\u2019m taking a gap year. I need a break. I am looking to volunteer abroad. I might go to Africa \u2014 I was supposed to go with Joaquin. I just want to get out of here for a while.\nHis best friend took me to prom. They totally ruined it: In the middle of the party, they played a slide show of the seniors who would have been there. You could see everyone fall to the ground and cry. That kind of scarred me. At the beginning of this school year, I didn\u2019t talk to anyone. One time, this girl was just staring at me. Nobody knows what to say. It is so uncomfortable.\nI\u2019m wearing his sweatshirt. I wear it all the time. I\u2019m going to sound really cheesy, but from the moment we met I knew I was going to spend my life with him. He was never my boyfriend. He said, \u201cI hope you know you\u2019re not my girlfriend. You\u2019re my soul mate.\u201d I know I\u2019m just a kid and kids don\u2019t know any better, but that was the purest form of love that there is. I\u2019m so thankful that I had that, even if it was for such a short time.\nLast year I was very sick at this time, and Joaquin was like, \u201cI really hope you feel better by Valentine\u2019s Day.\u201d That day was the first day I went back to school. I\u2019m really glad that I saw him that morning. That morning was probably the best day that we had together.\nLike many other parents, Joaquin Oliver\u2019s mother and father have become dedicated activists since their son\u2019s death. One of them was elected to the local school board. While the families don\u2019t all share the same political views, they stay in touch and occasionally meet, knowing they are bound by the pain of losing a child.\nMR. OLIVER: We have a lot of sad moments that we keep for ourselves. People don\u2019t know that I cry a lot. I sometimes find myself lost in life. And then I end up understanding that my son is not going to be back \u2014 as much as I cry, that\u2019s not going to happen.\nEverything that I see in the house relates to Joaquin. But I also miss my grown-up son, the one I will never have \u2014 the one that will go to college, get married, have kids. As a father, you have dreams. You see yourself as an old person, hanging out with your kids. That is not something that I can do anymore.\nWhat happened to Joaquin happens every single day. This is not about Joaquin only. This is not about Parkland only. This is not about Florida only. \nMS. OLIVER: There is no rule to follow. There is no book to read. Sometimes you have the best attitude, and other days you have to just get through it, and at the end of the day, you\u2019re just destroyed. To deal with my emptiness, I watch videos. I look at pictures. It helps me, seeing Joaquin alive \u2014 smiling, joking, talking.\nI feel Joaquin every single second. It was kind of raining a little while ago and I said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not going to rain. Because Joaquin is going to take care of it.\u201d And he answered, because look, it\u2019s sunny again.\nToday I met a girl who was in his classroom that day. I hadn\u2019t had a chance to talk to her before, and at least now I know that they didn\u2019t close the door on him. Because that was one of my concerns: that one of the screams they heard in the moment was him saying, \u201cHelp! Help!\u201d But she told me no. That brings me peace of mind.\nAn English and journalism teacher and yearbook adviser at Stoneman Douglas, she compiled stories from shooting survivors into a book. Two of her students, Jaime Guttenberg and Meadow Pollack, were killed.\nI went to the cemetery on Sunday. The first place I went to was Meadow. I just got out of the car, and I lost it. I was ugly crying. I apologized for what happened to her. I told Jaime that my daughter, Hannah, dedicates her competitive dances to her.\nOn Rosh Hashana I asked my rabbi if it would be O.K. to say Kaddish, the memorial prayer. I didn\u2019t want to be disrespectful to those whose immediate family member had died. He\u2019s like, \u201cOf course it\u2019s appropriate, Sarah. They meant so much to you.\u201d It was just so awful, to say it for people who shouldn\u2019t have gone so young and shouldn\u2019t have gone that way.\nLast night I got a call from a former student. It was almost 11 and she texted me, \u201cAre you up?\u201d She\u2019s isolated because she\u2019s far from home, and she hasn\u2019t had a second to stop and process. She calls me \u201cMom.\u201d That\u2019s the relationship I have with these kids.\nI can\u2019t see myself teaching anywhere else. I feel safe at school. But it\u2019s going to be a very heavy few days. On Thursday, I\u2019m going to get a massage and get my nails done and have lunch with my brother and try not to watch the news. I just need to be.\nAlain Delaqu\u00e9ri\u00e8re contributed research.
