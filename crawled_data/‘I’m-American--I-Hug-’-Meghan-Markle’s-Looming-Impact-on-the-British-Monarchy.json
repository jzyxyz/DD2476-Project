I Hug.\u2019 Meghan Markle\u2019s Looming Impact on the British Monarchy", "content": "LONDON \u2014 As a harbinger of things to come for Meghan Markle, consider a scene from her early encounter with royal protocol: After her first few visits to see her boyfriend in Kensington Palace, she began greeting the palace guards with hugs.\nAfter this happened several times, someone informed her that, according to the social codes of the world she was entering, hugging palace guards is Not Done. Ms. Markle, 36 \u2014 born and raised in Los Angeles, the daughter of a yoga teacher \u2014 listened politely to that advice.\nAnd ignored it.\n\u201cSomeone said to her, \u2018People don\u2019t do that,\u2019\u201d her friend Bonnie Hammer recalled in an interview to NBC. \u201cShe literally said, \u2018I\u2019m American. I hug.\u2019\u201d\nIn the last-minute focus on things that could go spectacularly wrong between now and Ms. Markle\u2019s wedding to Prince Harry on Saturday, it has been easy to lose sight of the change Ms. Markle represents for the British monarchy.\nShe is, like Harry\u2019s mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, informal and open. She is at ease in the glare of celebrity and adept at using it for her purposes. Raised as a political activist, she likes to recall the letter-writing campaign she undertook as an 11-year-old, in which she persuaded Procter & Gamble to withdraw an advertisement for dishwashing liquid that she thought was sexist.\nIn other words, she is many things the royal family is emphatically not. Already, Britain\u2019s monarchy is poised at the edge of an unpredictable modernization: Queen Elizabeth has reigned for 65 years, providing a beacon of continuity during a period of social turmoil and decline in British power.\nAnd many of the monarchy\u2019s supporters worry that the conservative traditions the queen represents \u2014 including emotional distance and political neutrality \u2014 will fall by the wayside when the younger generation takes control. The more \u201cnormal\u201d the royals seem, they say, the less people will see the point of the institution of monarchy.\nMs. Markle did not introduce this tension, which has divided palace traditionalists from modernizers for generations. But, at an anxious moment in Britain, she seems to personify it.\n\u201cThat is my biggest concern, that they will turn the monarchy into celebrity,\u201d said June Ash, the chairwoman of the Arts Society on the island of Jersey. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about medieval times, there\u2019s a history that carries through. You can\u2019t just say that it\u2019s celebrity. If we go down that route, it would be wrong. I hope it will stop at a certain point.\u201d\nThough there were similar worries before Catherine Middleton\u2019s marriage to Prince William, Ms. Ash added, with Ms. Markle, it seems more serious.\n\u201cKate, again, she is British, she knows the rules,\u201d Ms. Ash said. \u201cAmerican people are much more free in their way of thinking and their attitudes.\u201d\nThese fears have not been alleviated by the publicity in the lead-up to the wedding, in which Ms. Markle\u2019s friends \u2014 effusive, deeply tanned residents of Los Angeles \u2014 praised her as a change agent.\n\u201cShe will break convention, but in a good way, in a healthy way,\u201d Ms. Hammer, chairwoman of NBCUniversal Cable, said on \u201cInside the Royal Wedding,\u201d broadcast on NBC on Wednesday. \u201cShe will somehow take this monarchy and open it up to modern living, to modern women.\u201d\nTo an outsider, the British royal family\u2019s relationship with fame can seem peculiar. Though they lavishly promote the institution of the monarchy \u2014 recent months have seen a barrage of news releases on icing flavors (buttercream) and carriage upholstery (gold), accompanied by an orgy of personalized tea towels and coffee mugs \u2014 they are also visibly uncomfortable with all the attention.\nThere is a reason for this, a palace insider explained: In the royal family, self-promotion is considered a cardinal sin. Unlike the Scandinavian royals, who happily pose for photographs when walking into charity events, the British royals tend to stride by with their heads down, which can make them seem aloof and awkward.\nMs. Markle is not like that. She connects. In January, when a 10-year-old girl on a rope line asked her for an autograph, she grabbed the paper, wrote \u201cHi, Kaitlin,\u201d and drew a smiley face. This circumvented an unwritten rule of the royal family, for a reason that dates back centuries: If a royal signature is made public, it can be forged. Her most sharp-eyed monarchist critics, mostly women who caucus anonymously on social media, noted it down. A few weeks later, she did it again, hugging a 10-year-old girl. (Tradition dictates a handshake or \u201csmall curtsy.\u201d)\nIn this, Ms. Markle is similar to Prince Harry\u2019s mother. Diana was congenitally unable to maintain a formal distance, something that endeared her to ordinary people \u2014 \u201ccommoners,\u201d as they are sometimes called here \u2014 but that drove her palace handlers crazy. She was insistently human, and this stripped the royal family of some of its sheen. Particularly damaging was a  television interview she gave in 1995, describing her private struggles with bulimia, depression and her husband\u2019s infidelity.\nDiana\u2019s sons have made it clear that they plan to follow her model. Harry, in particular, has stepped forward as an advocate of modernization, telling Newsweek last year, \u201cEven if I was king, I would do my own shopping.\u201d This plan worries conservative royalists, as did the emotional interviews the princes gave on the 20th anniversary of their mother\u2019s death.\n\u201cEach time you do one, you\u2019re slightly peeling back the layers of the monarchy,\u201d said the television presenter Piers Morgan, who has logged time on a series of Fleet Street tabloids. This, he is convinced, will be the way of the future: As the younger generation rises in prominence, \u201cyou\u2019re going to see a more Diana-esque royal family,\u201d he said, more \u201ctouchy-feely and emotional and heart-on-sleeve.\u201d\nMr. Morgan also sees echoes of Diana in Ms. Markle, who he predicted would chafe at the \u201cnever complain, never explain\u201d ethos imposed by senior courtiers.\n\u201cWhen women feel suffocated and trapped by that world, they tend to go rogue,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a girl who, when she was 11 years old, wrote to Hillary Clinton demanding to get a commercial taken off TV. Is she really going to sit in that palace all day not saying anything?\u201d\nDickie Arbiter, a former press secretary to Queen Elizabeth II, expects Ms. Markle to struggle with the ban on expressing opinions on political matters, something the British tabloids will watch closely. An example came early this year, when her future sister-in-law, the Duchess of Cambridge, disappointed activists by refusing to wear black to a film and television awards ceremony as a sign of solidarity with the #MeToo movement. Ms. Markle, who has gone out of her way to express support for the #MeToo movement, would be expected to keep her views to herself.\n\u201cShe\u2019s marrying into an institution,\u201d Mr. Arbiter said. \u201cIt\u2019s apolitical. It has to sustain that, because that\u2019s what the constitutional monarchy is all about. That\u2019s why Charles I had his head chopped off.\u201d\nMr. Morgan was no less foreboding, though his worries about Ms. Markle are more general. He went so far as to invoke Wallis Simpson, the American divorc\u00e9e whose love affair with King Edward VIII prompted him to abdicate the British throne. Ms. Simpson died in 1986, but she remains one of the most hated people in Britain.\n\u201cIf Meghan has got a couple of kids and decides to take them back to California,\u201d he said, \u201cshe will make Wallis Simpson look like a tea party.\u201d\nBut the wedding is almost upon us. The day will be given over to bodices and bustles and edible flowers, a medieval spectacle shot through with an electric current of sex. Prince Harry and Ms. Markle are still in the first flush of genuine attraction, as anyone with access to a television can attest. (Compare those images to the 1981 interview of his parents, in which Prince Charles, asked if he was in love with Diana, responded, \u201cWhatever \u2018in love\u2019 means.\u201d)\nThe monarchy needs this charisma badly. By the late 1990s, ordinary Britons felt increasingly alienated from a \u201cprivileged, inward-looking, inbred royal family that was obviously dysfunctional,\u201d said Mark Leonard, co-author of a 1998 report that recommended swift and comprehensive modernization.\nThe royal family instituted new policies in an effort to keep up with the times, decommissioning the royal yacht and declaring that the queen would begin paying taxes. But it is the rise of Diana\u2019s sons \u2014 telegenic and more tethered to the world of ordinary Britons \u2014 that has been its salvation.\nWhen she arrives at St. George\u2019s Chapel at Windsor Castle on Saturday on the arm of her mother, Meghan Markle will represent the latest of these changes. She has shuttered her blog and social media accounts, with their traces of deeply held opinion.\nColleagues say she is fiercely disciplined on the set, intent on saying every line as it is written on the page. But she is also the girl whose childhood bedroom, her biographer wrote, featured a poster of Rosie the Riveter, sleeve rolled up and bicep flexed, under the motto \u201cWe Can Do It!\u201d This is the role she has been preparing for all her life.", "date": "May 18, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/18/world/europe/meghan-markle-monarchy-uk.html", "tags": "american meghan \u2018 markle monarchy royal hug. looming \u201d british palace ms. impact \u2014 family"}
