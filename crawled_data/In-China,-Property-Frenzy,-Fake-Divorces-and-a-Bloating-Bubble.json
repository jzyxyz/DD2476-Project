{"title": "In China, Property Frenzy, Fake Divorces and a Bloating Bubble", "content": "SHANGHAI \u2014 Zheng Ruizhen counted herself among the last holdouts on Lufeng Road.\nEven as high-rises sprang up in recent years to surround her dilapidated home, Ms. Zheng, a 50-year-old schoolteacher, and her husband, Sun Guojian, held firm. He grew up there. Her school was a 20-minute bicycle ride away. They raised their son there, though he eventually grew so tall that his head grazed the ceiling of his cramped room. When city officials pushed them to sell, they said no.\nThen came China\u2019s latest property bubble \u2014 a frothy surge in prices that could have global repercussions if it pops.\nIn August, an unremarkable piece of land around the corner from Ms. Zheng sold for nearly $2,000 a square foot, a national record and nearly three times the average land price in Manhattan. Local officials grew more insistent and threatened to tear down their bathroom.\nFinally, they relented, and Ms. Zheng\u2019s husband signed away the home for a price to be determined later. Then, on Oct. 9, Mr. Sun died of a heart attack, something Ms. Zheng said was perhaps influenced by stress over the pending demolition of their home.\nNow, as she grieves, she is waiting to hear how much the Shanghai government will offer in compensation \u2014 but however much that is, she knows it will not be enough for her to be able to afford to live anywhere close to Lufeng Road.\nSaid Ms. Zheng: \u201cI never expected housing prices in Shanghai would get this high.\u201d\nChina is in the midst of a dizzying housing bubble. Shanghai\u2019s average housing price is up nearly one-third from a year ago, with prices in major cities like Beijing and Guangzhou not far behind. Chinese consumers are rushing to buy homes before the government steps in with restrictions.\nWhen rumors swept through Shanghai that the government would require homeowners to pay more in taxes and down payments to buy additional properties, many couples filed for divorce so that one partner could still be treated as an independent buyer.\nChina has experienced housing booms and busts before. And fervor for real estate among the wealthiest Chinese has already spread far beyond the country\u2019s borders, from Long Island mansions to disused ranches in Texas \u2014 many to get their money out of the country.\nBut economists warn that the current boom on the Chinese mainland could be extra difficult to resolve: It comes with a growing amount of American-style debt.\nLong-term household loans \u2014 mostly mortgages \u2014 have doubled as a share of total official bank lending this year. They accounted for about 40 percent of all new loans in August, contrasted with just 20 percent at the start of the year. The value of new home loans as a percentage of all housing sales has surged to a record high.\nThe loans \u2014 largely a byproduct of a flood of Chinese lending to keep the economy growing \u2014 are helping the affluent, the middle class and low earners who have dreamed of owning a home, while investors and speculators are piling in, too. Underground lenders \u2014 those who operate outside the formal banking system using a variety of new platforms \u2014 are also helping to feed the boom.\nLast month, economists at the Bank of China warned in a report that worsening asset price bubbles were adding to a frothy market that could result in trouble. The day before, Wang Jianlin, a politically connected property and entertainment magnate who is one of the country\u2019s richest people, told CNN that China property was \u201cthe biggest bubble in history.\u201d\nThat could be bad news for the global economy. Many economists estimate that housing and related areas \u2014 like construction, cement manufacturing or furniture making \u2014 account for roughly one-fifth of China\u2019s economic activity. But if the bubble pops, that support could disappear quickly.\nChinese officials, apparently mindful of the 2008 American housing bust, appear to be aware of the risks of a debt-fueled property bubble. But some economists worry they will be too slow to rein it in.\n\u201cThe risk is that the government is late in cooling the market, the rally spreads to more areas, pushing up household leverage and construction activity, pushing the bubble bigger, which is then followed by a bigger downward correction,\u201d said Tao Wang, the head of China economics at UBS in Hong Kong.\nLocal regulators are already trying to cool things down. In the last few weeks, local authorities have accelerated efforts to tighten housing markets in up to 20 Chinese cities, according to economists at China International Capital Corporation, an investment bank.\nBut in many cases these steps have only added to the rush, as home buyers move in while they can.\nBy her account, Zhang Xia and her husband have enjoyed a happy marriage. Then the rumor swept the city that Shanghai authorities would make it harder for couples with one home to buy more.\nOn a recent Monday, Ms. Zhang, a 40-year-old resident of Shanghai\u2019s Huangpu area, and her husband sat waiting at a local marriage registry office to file for divorce. Shanghai officials continue to deny that they will limit house buying by couples, but Ms. Zhang is among many who do not believe them.\n\u201cWe know the government said this is a rumor, but they also said that a few times before, when the rumor actually came true,\u201d Ms. Zhang said. \u201cSome people even said the fact that the government said it\u2019s a rumor means it\u2019s going to be true.\u201d\nShanghai, China\u2019s financial capital, is at the heart of the property boom. Demand there is so intense that developers now commonly require sizable deposits of cash just to join a lottery to buy a new apartment. Only holders of winning numbers will be offered the chance to buy a unit. One flashy new development in central Shanghai charges a refundable 200,000 renminbi, or $30,000, to enter its lottery.\n\u201cIn Shanghai now,\u201d said Wang Jie, a sales manager there, \u201cit\u2019s not like you can buy an apartment just because you have money.\u201d\nBack on Lufeng Road, the recently widowed Ms. Zheng and her neighbors try to go about their lives despite the boom going on around them. Men and women play mah-jongg near a half-demolished house, one of a number of dwellings along the road in various states of disassembly, like a row of rotting teeth. Stray dogs sunbathe and alley cats hunt around piles of red bricks and wooden beams scattered on the street.\nIn recent months, local officials hung red propaganda banners on people\u2019s housing extolling the benefits of selling out. \u201cNo more hesitation means no more disappointment,\u201d reads one. Says another: \u201cRequisition and compensation are lawful. Smart alecks will regret it later.\u201d\n\u201cLook at those banners,\u201d Ms. Zheng said, shaking her head. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like the Cultural Revolution once again.\u201d\nEarlier, local officials told Ms. Zheng that the land where her home stands would be used to build supporting facilities for the next-door complex of high-rises built by China Vanke, the country\u2019s largest property developer.\n\u201cThey said that when people who live in the high-rises in Vanke look down, the view from their windows is our ugly roofs,\u201d she said. \u201cSo they have to get rid of us.\u201d", "date": "Oct. 16, 2016", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/17/business/international/china-home-price-bubble.html", "tags": "property fake bubble \u201c china bloating divorces home frenzy shanghai housing ms. zheng \u2014"}
