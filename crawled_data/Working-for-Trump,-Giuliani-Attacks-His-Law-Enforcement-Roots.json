{"title": "Working for Trump, Giuliani Attacks His Law-Enforcement Roots", "content": "Over the years, there have been few more vocal or aggressive advocates for law enforcement than Rudolph W. Giuliani. A former top official at the Justice Department, a onetime prosecutor with a tough, crusading style, and a police-embracing mayor who ran New York on a law-and-order platform, Mr. Giuliani \u2014 both in office and as a private citizen \u2014 has spent the better part of his career stridently defending the country\u2019s crime-fighting class and fiercely lashing out at those who attack it.\nBut in his latest role as a lawyer for President Trump, Mr. Giuliani (who, like his client, is volatile by nature) appears to have made an abrupt change of course. In the past few days, he has launched a series of rants in the media, assailing his former colleagues in law enforcement \u2014 and the work that they have done \u2014 as Nazis, frauds and garbage. And in a phone interview Friday, he defended the strong criticism he had made.\nWhile the path from prosecutor to defense lawyer is a common one that often requires a sharp shift in perspective, several former law-enforcement officials said they found it curious that Mr. Giuliani had so quickly and belligerently turned his back on a world he had worked in for nearly 30 years. Even some who expressed support for him said that his assaults on everyone and everything from the Russia investigation to James B. Comey, the former director of the F.B.I., to the bureau\u2019s New York office, seemed to be out of character.\n\u201cIt\u2019s astonishing, especially from someone who has been so supportive of law enforcement for as long as he has,\u201d said Asha Rangappa, a former F.B.I. agent who now works as a TV analyst and a senior lecturer at Yale University. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that anyone believes that he really believes what he\u2019s been saying. But it\u2019s a standard defense counsel playbook. When you don\u2019t have the facts on your side, you attack the investigators.\u201d\nMr. Giuliani\u2019s verbal strikes began on Wednesday night when he appeared with Sean Hannity on Fox News and declared that the F.B.I.\u2019s office in New York \u2014 with which he worked closely during his time as United States attorney in Manhattan \u2014 had behaved like \u201cstorm-troopers\u201d in conducting raids on the president\u2019s former lawyer, Michael D. Cohen. In the same interview, he called Mr. Comey \u201ca disgraceful liar\u201d and said he should be prosecuted. He also had strong words for the investigation by the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, which he dismissed as \u201ctainted\u201d and \u201ctotally garbage.\u201d\nOn Thursday morning, after Mr. Comey shot back on his Twitter account, saying that the New York F.B.I. was \u201cdevoted to the rule of law and the truth,\u201d Mr. Giuliani assailed Mr. Comey, his onetime colleague in the United States attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan, as a \u201csensitive little baby.\u201d By Thursday afternoon, he had tossed another bomb, calling for Attorney General Jeff Sessions to \u201cstep in\u201d on the Cohen case and put the people behind it \u201cunder investigation.\u201d\nIn all of this, Mr. Giuliani was following the lead of Mr. Trump, who in both the Cohen and Russia matters has adopted a strategy of attacking agents, prosecutors and the larger institutions of the Justice Department and the F.B.I. While some former law-enforcement officials said that those attacks had eroded trust in the criminal-justice establishment, others said that the figures singled out by the president and his lawyer were deserving of their ire.\n\u201cRudy is not anti-law enforcement, but he is upset, like me, at a small cadre of people who have lost their way,\u201d said James K. Kallstrom, who once ran the New York office of the F.B.I. and has emerged more recently as a vigorous supporter of Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani. \u201cWe\u2019ve had long talks about it and what we can do to rebuild the bureau.\u201d\nThough Mr. Kallstrom acknowledged that Mr. Giuliani, in his television appearances, could have opted \u201cfor a better choice of words,\u201d he also said there was ample reason to be wary of some recent decisions by law-enforcement officers. He criticized, for instance, the way that F.B.I. agents, acting on a search warrant last year, broke into the home of Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign manager. Mr. Kallstrom also blasted the more recent raids on Mr. Cohen\u2019s office, apartment and hotel room, saying that they may have violated the attorney-client privilege.\nIn an interview on Friday evening, Mr. Giuliani echoed those concerns, adding that while he maintained respect for Mr. Mueller, some of the prosecutors on the special counsel\u2019s team had \u201cethical problems.\u201d He also said that his recent criticisms were not at odds with his law-enforcement past.\n\u201dIt\u2019s all consistent with law and order, because some of these people aren\u2019t acting appropriately,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said. \u201cI\u2019ve never been in favor of out-of-control law and order. I\u2019m not going after the whole F.B.I. I\u2019m going after the people on this case.\u201d\nStill, it is not the normal course for a former top criminal-justice official to savage the institutions that gave birth to him. But the inquiries into Mr. Trump and his associates are so riven by questions of legal ethics and partisan politics that they seemed to have polarized and stirred up passions in law-enforcement circles.\nTrying to take the middle course, Nancy Savage, the executive director of the Society of Former Special Agents of the F.B.I., said that Mr. Giuliani \u201chas a long history of supporting the F.B.I. and of supporting law enforcement.\u201d But Ms. Savage also noted, \u201cThere are numerous, serious investigations that are ongoing and they need to be respected moving forward.\u201d\nTom O\u2019Connor, the president of a similar group, the F.B.I. Agents Association, said of Mr. Giuliani, \u201cIt is disappointing when former officials who have historically supported F.B.I. special agents and the investigative process now demean agents for performing our jobs.\u201d\nA former United States attorney in Manhattan, John S. Martin Jr., had an even blunter view of Mr. Giuliani, saying that he had more or less betrayed his erstwhile colleagues.\n\u201cHe\u2019s dancing to Trump\u2019s tune,\u201d said Mr. Martin, who has been critical of Mr. Giuliani in the past. \u201cHe\u2019s playing the political game. He\u2019s saying what Trump wants him to say. He turned his back on law enforcement to make Trump happy.\u201d", "date": "May 4, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/nyregion/giuliani-trump-fbi-law-enforcement.html", "tags": "working giuliani f.b.i former \u201d trump law-enforcement roots \u2014 law attacks"}
