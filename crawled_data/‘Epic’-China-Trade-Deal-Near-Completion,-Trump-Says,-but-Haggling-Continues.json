{"title": "\u2018Epic\u2019 China Trade Deal Near Completion, Trump Says, but Haggling Continues", "content": "President Trump stopped short of announcing a final trade deal with China on Thursday, saying in an Oval Office meeting with the Chinese delegation that it may take another four weeks or more to secure an \u201cepic\u201d trade agreement.\nNegotiators had originally aimed to secure a deal this week during a visit from Liu He, the Chinese vice premier and special trade envoy, and announce a presidential summit meeting between Mr. Trump and Xi Jinping of China. But after more than a year of tit-for-tat tariffs, on-and-off negotiations and threats of additional punishment, the United States and China continue to haggle over some remaining issues, including how many of the American tariffs on Chinese goods will be removed, and when.\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking intellectual property protection and theft. We\u2019re talking about certain tariffs,\u201d Mr. Trump said, referring to issues that remain unresolved.\nPeople familiar with the negotiations had said that the president was poised to announce a summit meeting with China. But those plans spurred a backlash among some of the president\u2019s trade advisers, who argued that announcing a meeting before the deal was struck would weaken the United States\u2019 hand and give it less leverage to force changes it is seeking.\nIn remarks at the White House, Mr. Trump said that the deal was \u201cvery complete\u201d and that the two sides had \u201cagreed to far more than we have left to agree to.\u201d\n\u201cI think I can say some of the toughest things have been agreed to,\u201d he continued.\nBut he said there would be no summit meeting until a final deal was made. \u201cIf we have a deal then we\u2019ll have a summit,\u201d the president said.\nThe date and location of a summit meeting have also proved controversial. The United States had initially proposed holding one at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump\u2019s Florida resort, but China has been pushing for an official state visit in Washington or a neutral location in a third country, people familiar with the matter said.\nLawmakers had publicly fretted about announcing a summit meeting before the deal was inked, suggesting that Mr. Trump was surrendering his leverage in his eagerness to sign an agreement.\nBoth Republicans and Democrats have urged Mr. Trump to hold out for a tough deal to combat Chinese practices that American businesses have long seen as problematic, including the coerced transfer of foreign technology as a condition of doing business in the country and the ample government subsidies for Chinese firms.\n\u201cLast week @POTUS told us he would not sign a \u2018good\u2019 trade deal with #China he would only sign a \u2018great\u2019 one,\u201d Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said in a Twitter post on Thursday morning. \u201cI believe him. But to be a \u2018great\u2019 deal it must allow us to do in China what they can do in US & it must have real enforcement mechanisms.\u201d\nThe United States has pressed China to make commitments on purchasing American goods, opening markets to foreign business and increasing protections for foreign intellectual property in a bid to rebalance an economic relationship that Mr. Trump says is unfair for American workers. It remains to be seen how sweeping and significant any agreement will be, and whether it will achieve the lofty promises Mr. Trump has made about resetting the economic relationship with Beijing.\nBut the White House is also facing pressure to resolve the trade war, which has begun to hurt American farming, manufacturing and other sectors, and caused wild swings on Wall Street. Industries including automaking, technology manufacturing and farming have anxiously awaited reduced tariffs and details of a new agreement, which will have huge implications for their businesses.\nThe president\u2019s tariffs have been successful at bringing the Chinese to the negotiating table, and his advisers have insisted they will not squander an opportunity to press China for substantial economic reforms that past administrations were unable to secure. Still, the Chinese have balked at making any reforms that could be viewed as infringing on their sovereignty or undercutting the Communist Party\u2019s control of the economy.\n\u201cIf you and I are making a deal, and you have to drag me kicking and screaming the whole way, what are the odds the deal is going to hold?\u201d asked Derek Scissors, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. \u201cI don\u2019t find that the slightest bit convincing.\u201d\nAmerican negotiators have pushed for an enforcement mechanism that would allow tariffs on Chinese goods to snap back if China violated the terms of the deal, and that would forbid China to retaliate. But Chinese negotiators have resisted such an idea, describing it as a potential infringement on their sovereignty.\nMyron Brilliant, the executive vice president and head of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said foreign stakeholders would be scrutinizing the deal to see whether it contained a strong enforcement mechanism that would hold the Chinese accountable to their obligations.\n\u201cThat is what would separate this agreement from previous agreements,\u201d he said.\nThe two sides spent the past two months drawing up more than 120 pages of an agreement covering issues including forced technology transfer and cybertheft, intellectual property rights, currency and nontariff barriers to trade. The Trump administration has also pressed China to commit to hundreds of billions in purchases of American products, including agricultural products, energy and airplanes.\nThe administration has been eager to front-load China\u2019s purchases of American products to help bolster farm country and other important constituencies and try to bring down the bilateral trade deficit before the 2020 election. Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers would prefer to keep the tariffs in place as long as possible, an arrangement the Chinese oppose.\nIn recent weeks, Beijing has introduced a steady drumbeat of other reforms intended to please American constituencies and win Mr. Trump\u2019s favor. China has resumed purchases of American soybeans and announced it would reclassify fentanyl, which has fueled the American opioid epidemic, as a controlled substance. Beijing also approved a sweeping rewrite of a foreign investment law that may help foreign companies avoid unequal treatment. And it approved a request by JPMorgan Chase to establish a majority owned and controlled securities brokerage firm in the country and floated the idea of expanding access for foreign cloud computing companies.\nChina experts have cautioned that the long-running economic stresses between the countries are unlikely to be entirely put to rest with this round of negotiations.\n\u201cThe negotiations, no matter what anybody says, will not end at the end of this phase,\u201d said David Lampton, a fellow at Stanford University\u2019s Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies. \u201cWe\u2019ve got decades of painful negotiating with China ahead.\u201d", "date": "April 4, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/business/economy/trump-xi-china-trade-meeting.html", "tags": "american near completion \u2018 haggling continues mr. china epic \u201d trump says trade chinese deal"}
