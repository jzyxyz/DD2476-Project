{"title": "Laura Ingraham Has Been Peddling White Nationalism For Years- A Reminder", "content": "From her perch on a prime-time national television show, conservative commentator Laura Ingraham went off on a shameless rant Wednesday night about \u201cmassive demographic changes\u201d in the United States that \u201cmost of us don\u2019t like,\u201d attacking even immigrants who migrate legally.\n\u201cIn some parts of the country, it does seem like the America that we know and love doesn\u2019t exist anymore,\u201d Ingraham said\u00a0on her Fox News program, \u201cThe Ingraham Angle,\u201d in a not-at-all-veiled dig at people of color later endorsed by ex-KKK leader David Duke.\u00a0While Ingraham added that \u201cit\u2019s not about race or ethnicity,\u201d the thrust of her comments was unmistakable.\nIn a word, it was bonkersville. But not surprising. Ingraham has been preaching for years to white Americans who feel anxious about the country\u2019s evolving demographics, demonizing immigrants and championing a nostalgic version of the past that doesn\u2019t live up to its rosy ideal.\nHere are some of her more outrageous statements:\n\u201cThis is just their shorthand way of trying to demean anyone who is not part of the press cabal, the press club,\u201d Ingraham said\u00a0on her radio show of the term \u201calt-right,\u201d now embraced by some white nationalists and white supremacists, shortly after the 2016 election. \u201cBut if you\u2019re not in on their club, and you happen to come at it from a more traditional perspective, then you\u2019re alt-right,\u201d she added.\nAs defined by the Southern Poverty Law Center, alt-right sympathizers believe white identity is under attack from historically maligned and marginalized groups. The so-called alt-right rejects traditional conservatism, and its members can be violent; some of them staged last summer\u2019s deadly rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.\u00a0\nIngraham spouted\u00a0more nonsense on her Fox program in June, claiming that \u201cnot only do today\u2019s liberals \u2015 many of them \u2015 hate our American traditions and a lot of our heritage, but they are also the agents of a historical and cultural purge the likes of which I don\u2019t think we have ever seen in our nation.\u201d Yikes.\n\u201cThis is what third world immigration does to Europe,\u201d read a now-deleted tweet by British National Party figure Mark Collett alongside video of what appears to be an overflowing dumpster. Ingraham shared the post earlier this year with her nearly 2 million followers, asking if anyone could confirm that the video depicts a street in Paris. In doing so, she amplified the voice of a man who says he admires Adolf Hitler and considers AIDS a \u201cfriendly\u201d disease because of its prevalence among black people and gay people.\u00a0\nDuring a discussion last summer over terror attacks in the U.K., Ingraham blamed London Mayor Sadiq Kahn, who cheers his city\u2019s diversity.\n\u201cNow the price they have to pay for multiculturalism is the risk that you\u2019re walking on the sidewalk and a man will \u2015 or a woman, will purposefully mow you down. And then while you\u2019re maybe finishing your cappuccino in a cafe, or having a drink, someone will put a knife to your throat and slit it with the attempt, perhaps, to behead you,\u201d she said on Fox News.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we all have to live with for the free and open society that Sadiq Khan and all these other multiculturalists want Britain to become.\u201d\nIn a 2015 rant, Ingraham complained about immigration policy by suggesting that the U.S. allows too many people from \u201cfar-flung lands\u201d in the Middle East.\u00a0\n\u201cSo we\u2019re supposed to lower our standard of living here in the United States, for what, exactly?\u201d she asked, referencing potential extremist views immigrants may bring and scoffing at the idea of humanitarianism. She continued: \u201cWell, if that\u2019s the case, we should have brought in the Christians before they were being slaughtered in the Middle East.\u201d\n\u201cThe Christians who we can verifiably say are Christians, who are in the threat of being slaughtered, I\u2019m happy to bring in some of them. I think most people would. But all these other people, they\u2019ve got to stay in the Middle East.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a false claim Trump has made every so often since 2015. Ingraham addressed it with a caller during a March 2016 episode of her radio show, cutting off the guest who brought up \u201cthe thing about the Mexicans and murderers and rapists\u201d to interject, \u201cWell, they have come here.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, they have come here to murder and rape our people. We know that,\u201d she said before adding a caveat. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean everybody has, doesn\u2019t mean everyone who comes across the border is a nasty, horrible person, but they have violated our laws.\u201d\nAs she\u00a0spoke\u00a0about the proportion of people in federal prisons who are undocumented, a frustrated Ingraham offered her own solution.\u00a0\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we ship them out of this country, why are we paying for these horrific individuals? They do their time, get out of the country, never coming back. Never coming back. You come back, you\u2019ll be shot,\u201d she said in 2015.\nBack in 2013, Ingraham boasted of a tweet, no longer visible, in which she asked whether immigration advocates would prefer the term \u201canchor fetus\u201d to \u201canchor baby,\u201d used to describe children of undocumented immigrants who are citizens by birth.\u00a0\nDiscussing Trump\u2019s zero tolerance immigration policy on Fox in June, Ingraham considerably downplayed conditions at detention facilities for children that doctors say could lead to \u201cirreparable harm.\u201d\n\u201cMore kids are being separated from their parents and temporarily housed in what are essentially summer camps, or as The San Diego Union Tribune described them today, as basically looking like boarding schools,\u201d she said. \u201cThe American people are footing a really big bill for what is tantamount to a slow-rolling invasion of the United States.\u201d", "date": "\n08/09/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/laura-ingraham-white-nationalism_n_5b6c5728e4b0bdd0620727b1", "tags": "country fox alt-right years- immigrants laura white \u201d nationalism reminder peddling ingraham said"}
