Won\u2019t Be Extorted, Rosenstein Warns Republicans", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 After months of conceding to demands from a small group of House Republicans for more visibility into continuing investigations, the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, pushed back on Tuesday, declaring that the Justice Department \u201cis not going to be extorted.\u201d\nHis comment came the day after revelations that several of those Republicans, led by Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina and other loyalists of President Trump, had drafted articles of impeachment to use against Mr. Rosenstein in case the long-simmering dispute with the deputy attorney general boiled over.\nThough their conflict is ostensibly over the Justice Department\u2019s production of sensitive documents to Congress, Democrats believe that the bureaucratic disagreement belies a more fundamental concern for the lawmakers: protecting Mr. Trump from the special counsel investigation, which Mr. Rosenstein oversees.\nMr. Rosenstein said he had been threatened, though he did not name the Republicans.\n\u201cThere have been people who have been making threats, privately and publicly, against me for quite some time,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think they should understand by now, the Department of Justice is not going to be extorted.\u201d\nHe accused the Republicans of leaking their own draft articles of impeachment to reporters and said he would not comment on a document \u201cno one has the courage to put their name on,\u201d drawing a distinction from how the Justice Department prosecutes cases.\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to accuse somebody of wrongdoing, we have to have admissible evidence and credible witnesses,\u201d Mr. Rosenstein said. \u201cWe need to prepare to prove our case in court. And we have to affix our signature to the charging document.\u201d\nMr. Meadows fired back, accusing Mr. Rosenstein of stonewalling and calling on him to resign.\n\u201cIf he believes being asked to do his job is \u2018extortion,\u2019 then Rod Rosenstein should step aside and allow us to find a new deputy attorney general \u2014 preferably one who is interested in transparency,\u201d Mr. Meadows, the chairman of the conservative Freedom Caucus, said in a statement.\nThe draft impeachment articles are unlikely to advance through the House, where the Judiciary Committee and possibly the full chamber would have a say. But they represent the most explicit threat yet to Mr. Rosenstein by lawmakers with close ties to Mr. Trump.\nThe lawmakers have been threatening to impose sanctions on or even impeach Mr. Rosenstein, 53, on and off for months as they have tangled over access to sensitive documents related to some of the F.B.I.\u2019s most politically charged cases. Democrats have feared that Republicans would use any failure to comply as a pretext to fire the deputy attorney general.\nThe rebuke from Mr. Rosenstein was at odds with his earlier actions. He has worked to meet the demands of lawmakers, recently letting them review an almost completely unredacted F.B.I. memo on the opening of a still-active investigation of the Trump campaign, a highly unusual step.\nMr. Rosenstein also personally signed off on an F.B.I. raid of the home, office and hotel room of Michael D. Cohen, the president\u2019s personal lawyer. In the days that followed, the president and his allies in Congress escalated their criticisms of Mr. Rosenstein, whose oversight of the Russia investigation gives him power to narrow the scope of the inquiry. Democrats fear that a new deputy attorney general could hobble the investigation without ending it, a move that could create havoc ahead of the midterm elections.\nWhile he was critical of Republican lawmakers, Mr. Rosenstein was more flattering of Mr. Trump during Tuesday\u2019s event at the Newseum in Washington honoring the Constitution and the rule of law.\nHe said that there is no threat \u201cto the rule of law in America today\u201d because it is protected by the Constitution.\nHe also fought back against accusations that Mr. Trump\u2019s continued assailing of law enforcement officials has undermined the Justice Department\u2019s traditional independence from political interference. Noting that the department is \u201cnot independent of the executive branch,\u201d he said its mission was to enforce the law as well as carry out the priorities of the administration, and that the two were not in conflict.\nMr. Rosenstein sometimes spoke with the emphasis of a prosecutor giving closing arguments before a jury. At times he drew a copy of the Constitution from his breast pocket and brandished it to make a point.\nBut he also held forth on less weighty matters, including pronunciation of his own last name, an occasional topic of lighthearted debate in Washington.\n\u201cSo, there\u2019s no right answer to that,\u201d he said. \u201cMy father pronounces it \u2018stine.\u2019 That\u2019s how I pronounce it. But I actually have relatives who pronounce it \u2018steen,\u2019 so I\u2019ll answer to either one.\u201d", "date": "May 1, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/01/us/politics/rosenstein-justice-department-republicans.html", "tags": "warns rosenstein department justice \u201d dept extorted attorney republicans deputy"}
