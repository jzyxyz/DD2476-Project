{"title": "N.R.A. Sues Contractor Behind NRATV", "content": "It\u2019s the N.R.A. versus NRATV.\nThe National Rifle Association sued one of its largest and most enduring contractors late last week and raised concerns about the contractor\u2019s relationship to the association\u2019s own president, Oliver North, in a stunning breach within the normally buttoned-up organization.\nThe suit was filed late Friday by the N.R.A. in Virginia, where it is based, against Ackerman McQueen, the Oklahoma ad firm that operates NRATV, the group\u2019s incendiary online media arm. The suit asserts that Ackerman has concealed details from the N.R.A. about how the company is spending the roughly $40 million that it and its affiliates receive annually from the association.\nThe suit creates uncertainty about Mr. North\u2019s future at the organization. And it leaves the future of NRATV in doubt, given the new acrimony in the Ackerman relationship.\nSince Ackerman created NRATV in 2016, it has often been \u201cperceived by the public as the voice of the N.R.A.,\u201d according to the rifle association\u2019s complaint. It has also taken on an apocalyptic tone, warning of race wars, calling for a march on the Federal Bureau of Investigation and portraying the talking trains in the children\u2019s show \u201cThomas & Friends\u201d in Ku Klux Klan hoods.\nThe New York Times reported  this year that two prominent N.R.A. board members were among those voicing alarm inside the association that NRATV was often straying beyond gun rights. The Times article also revealed that Ackerman had a previously undisclosed financial relationship with Mr. North.\nThe association is untangling broader problems as well, including a legal fight in New York with the administration of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo over an insurance program the N.R.A. offers to gun owners. The new state attorney general, Letitia James, has also repeatedly threatened to investigate the tax-exempt status of the organization, which was incorporated in New York.\nFacing this regulatory backdrop, the association began a review of its financial relationships with hundreds of vendors in August to ensure that it was in compliance with best practices.\nThe N.R.A. complaint alleges that Ackerman refused to turn over a number of financial records, including those detailing out-of-pocket expenses \u201cthat lacked meaningful documentation of N.R.A. approvals, receipts or other support.\u201d The association also wants documents that it says could allay its concern that it was being invoiced for the full salaries of Ackerman employees who also did work for other Ackerman clients. In addition, the complaint alleges that Ackerman has refused to provide data about NRATV\u2019s unique visitors and various other performance measures.\n\u201cThe N.R.A.\u2019s patience has run out,\u201d the suit says.\nAckerman, in a statement, sharply disputed the contentions in the lawsuit, whose filing was earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal.\n\u201cDuring a three-week review, an N.R.A. forensic auditing firm received every single piece of information they [the N.R.A.] requested,\u201d the statement said. \u201cFurther, the N.R.A. has had consistent access to any and all documents regarding NRATV analytics. Despite the representation set forth in their lawsuit, the N.R.A. had the personnel contract they claim AM withheld last week before they filed their lawsuit.\u201d\nThe complaint details a peculiar standoff with Ackerman over Mr. North, who took over as president last year. The N.R.A. claims it was aware that Mr. North had a contract to act as the host of a web series for Ackerman, but that Ackerman has refused to provide a copy of the contract for nearly six months. Additionally, Mr. North\u2019s counsel told the N.R.A. that \u201che could only disclose a copy of the contract\u201d if Ackerman said he could, the suit says.\nSubsequently, Ackerman allowed the N.R.A.\u2019s general counsel to view the contract but not keep a copy; the viewing added to N.R.A. concerns that it had not previously received an accurate summary of the document. The association was also concerned that Mr. North\u2019s relationship to Ackerman could \u201csupersede his duties to the N.R.A.\u201d\nA standoff persists over additional details about the relationship, according to the complaint.\nThe lawsuit is further complicated by family ties. The N.R.A.\u2019s outside lawyer, William A. Brewer III, is the son-in-law of Angus McQueen, a co-chief executive of Ackerman, and the brother-in-law of Revan McQueen, its chief executive. Ackerman called the relationships an \u201cirreconcilable conflict of interest\u201d and said some kind of family dispute \u201cpervades the Brewer firm\u2019s dealings with Ackerman McQueen.\u201d\nTravis Carter, a spokesman for Mr. Brewer\u2019s law firm, said \u201cthe familial relationship\u201d had \u201cno bearing whatsoever on the N.R.A.\u2019s litigation strategy.\u201d He added, \u201cAny suggestion to the contrary is contrived and a red herring.\u201d\nThe suit culminates the fracturing of a more than three-decade relationship between Ackerman and the N.R.A., going back to the shaping of such memorable lines as Charlton Heston\u2019s proclaiming that his gun would have to be pried \u201cfrom my cold, dead hands.\u201d Wayne LaPierre, the longtime chief executive of the N.R.A., had previously been a steadfast champion of the Ackerman relationship.\n\u201cI think it says something about Wayne\u2019s character, even though he\u2019s had a long-term working business relationship with a vendor, he\u2019s willing to do what is right and necessary for the N.R.A. and its members,\u201d said Todd Rathner, a board member of the rifle association.\nJoel Friedman, another board member, said he was dismayed that the documents had not been turned over.\n\u201cIt leaves you questioning, and you can come up with all these potential different scenarios as to why, but none of them are good,\u201d he said.\n\u201cMy mind goes to: Are they overcharging us? That\u2019s one,\u201d he added. \u201cTwo, are there things charged to us that were not part of the contract? Then, No. 3, has there been a misallocation of personnel?\u201d", "date": "April 15, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/business/nra-nratv-lawsuit.html", "tags": "contractor ackerman nratv sues n.r.a \u201d n.r.a. association relationship behind north"}
