{"title": "Donald Trump Serves Up Piping Hot Nonsense On Obamacare", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2015 You would think that Obamacare had enough real problems that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump would be able to stick to discussing them when taking a swing at the health care law. But you\u2019d be wrong.\nDuring a campaign event promotion for his hotels at the Trump National Doral Miami resort Tuesday, the GOP nominee seized on the news that health insurance premiums on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s exchange marketplaces are going up by a lot for some people next year.\nBut naturally, instead of just using this information to criticize the law and propose something better (or \u201csomething terrific,\u201d\u00a0as he\u2019s fond of saying), Trump opted to go a little nuts.\nPolitico reporter Eli Stokols was on the scene in Florida. (Read his dispatch here.) Let\u2019s start with this:\nLike with seemingly everything else, Trump appears incapable of just accepting the facts.\nHere they are: The Department of Health and Human Services announced Monday that the premiums for \u201cbenchmark\u201d plans on the exchanges \u2015 those used to set the size of subsidies that most exchange customers receive \u2015 would rise an average of 25 percent next year in the 39 states that use the federal exchange system on HealthCare.gov.\nThat\u2019s a lot! And while that average obscures even higher average increases in some states \u2015 including those on the order of what Trump claims here \u2015 that doesn\u2019t make 25 percent \u201cphony.\u201d It\u2019s how averages work.\u00a0\nAnd let\u2019s recall that Trump has claimed more than once that President Barack Obama would somehow hide these numbers and postpone the three-month insurance enrollment period that begins Nov. 1 to help Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton win.\n\u00a0And then there\u2019s this, which comes close to making no sense:\nTrump, in fact, claimed \u201call\u201d the people who work for him are having these \u201ctremendous problems,\u201d per Reid J. Epstein of the Wall Street Journal.\nBut wait! Let\u2019s break this down. The Trump Organization, like virtually all large employers in the U.S., provides health benefits to its full-time employees, so there\u2019s no way \u201call\u201d the people who work there are having \u201cproblems\u201d with Obamacare.\nJob-based health insurance isn\u2019t \u201cObamacare.\u201d While that term is used interchangeably with the Affordable Care Act, the rate increases in question only affect people who use the exchanges, not people who have health coverage from a job or a government program like Medicare or Medicaid. In fact, premiums for employer health insurance are rising much more slowly.\nAnd apparently, the Trump Organization offers quality health insurance!\u00a0Good for the Trump Organization! This is how one leading expert in workplace benefits described it to Salon earlier this year:\nTrump knows what he said was false, too. Or maybe he just\u00a0doesn\u2019t actually understand what Obamacare is?\nThe guy who runs the Miami resort where Trump appeared Tuesday knows this is false, too.\n(Stokols subsequently tweeted that the man\u2019s last name is spelled \u201cFeder.\u201d)\nLater, on Fox News, Trump said \u2015 well, he said something. Via Sopan Deb at CBS News:\u00a0\nThis is gobbledygook.\nLarge businesses like the Trump Organization don\u2019t \u201cuse\u201d Obamacare. Businesses buy health insurance for large numbers of people from commercial insurance carriers (or businesses contract with those providers to administer benefits but pay workers\u2019 medical bills with company money).\nEven though it\u2019s true, as Trump said, that some people who can\u2019t get insurance from a job \u2015 like the part-time workers at his company\u00a0\u2015 can\u2019t afford policies from an exchange or directly from an insurer, this statement still contradicts his assertion that \u201call\u201d his employees are having \u201ctremendous problems\u201d with Obamacare.\u00a0\nBut what about those employees who aren\u2019t on the company plan, which likely includes only people who work part-time and aren\u2019t offered those benefits? Those who have health coverage at all might be using the exchanges (or they might have Medicaid or be covered by a family member\u2019s insurance or something else).\u00a0\nAre those employees having \u201ctremendous problems\u201d? Possibly. People who earn too much for subsidies on the exchanges have no protection from the rate hikes next year.\nBut those subsidies are available to people who earn up to four times the federal poverty level, which comes to about $47,000 a year for a single person. The average annual earnings for a maid working full time are less than half of that, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nBut let\u2019s just assume, for the sake of argument, that there are Trump Organization employees who are being hit hard by the Obamacare rate increases.\u00a0Believing Donald J. Trump has any idea about that would require believing that he knows or cares about the personal problems his low-wage workers are experiencing, which, come on.\nEditor\u2019s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims \u2014 1.6 billion members of an entire religion \u2014 from entering the U.S.", "date": "\n10/25/2016", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-nonsense-on-obamacare_n_580f6a39e4b0a03911eec257", "tags": "piping \u201c problems obamacare trump \u2015 donald serves nonsense insurance hot health"}
