{"title": "Muffet McGraw Says She Won\u2019t Hire a Man on Her Coaching Staff. Let Her Tell You Why.", "content": "TAMPA, Fla. \u2014 Notre Dame Coach Muffet McGraw has been on the Final Four stage nine times in her career. She has answered hundreds of questions about her team, about her rivalry with Connecticut\u2019s Geno Auriemma, about the state of women\u2019s basketball. But her news conference on Thursday was different. It was passionate, and it was personal.\nMuffet McGraw has had enough.\nEnough of the declining percentage of women coaching women\u2019s basketball teams. Enough of the limited female representation in Congress. Enough of confining gender roles. Enough of the gender pay gap.\n\u201cMen run the world. Men have the power. Men make the decisions. It\u2019s always the man that is the stronger one,\u201d McGraw said, her voice rising in response to a question about saying in a recent ThinkProgress article that she would not hire another man for her coaching staff.\n\u201cWhen these girls are coming out, who are they looking up to to tell them that\u2019s not the way it has to be?\u201d McGraw continued. \u201cWhere better to do that than in sports? All these millions of girls that play sports across the country, we\u2019re teaching them great things about life skills, but wouldn\u2019t it be great if we could teach them to watch how women lead?\u201d\nIn 1972, when the gender equity law known as Title IX was enacted, women were head coaches of more than 90 percent of the women\u2019s college teams across two dozen sports. The percentage has decreased to about 40 now. The numbers are slightly better for women\u2019s basketball, the most visible collegiate sport for women; about 59 percent of women\u2019s college basketball teams were coached by women last year compared with 79 percent in 1977.\nThough the issue is not new, it has been especially prominent on the sport\u2019s biggest stage this week. Tennessee has not been to a Final Four since 2008, but the program\u2019s coaching vacancy has been widely discussed.\nPat Summitt coached Tennessee for decades, building the program into a perennial powerhouse and making herself a leading figure in the sport. Holly Warlick, Summitt\u2019s longtime assistant, took over when Summit left in 2012 because of early onset dementia. Warlick was fired last week, and Tennessee is conducting its first search for a women\u2019s basketball coach in 45 years.\nWhen Louisville Coach Jeff Walz was mentioned as a candidate, a loud debate about the ramifications of that decision ensued. Would Tennessee hire a man to run the House that Pat Built? And should it matter if the coach is a man or a woman, as long as they\u2019re qualified?\nMcGraw said \u2014 loudly, pointedly \u2014 that it definitely matters.\n\u201cWhen you look at men\u2019s basketball, 99 percent of the jobs go to men, why shouldn\u2019t 100 or 99 percent of the jobs in women\u2019s basketball go to women?\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because we only have 10 percent women athletic directors in Division I. People hire people who look like them. That\u2019s the problem.\u201d\nMcGraw\u2019s comments also addressed topics like the failed Equal Rights Amendment and female representation in politics.\n\u201cI\u2019m getting tired of the novelty of the first female governor of this state, the first female African-American mayor of this city. When is it going to become the norm instead of the exception?\u201d she said, adding: \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough female role models. We don\u2019t have enough visible women leaders. We don\u2019t have enough women in power.\u201d\nNotre Dame, the defending national champion, will meet UConn in a national semifinal on Friday night, the latest chapter in an intense rivalry that has played out on the court and in the news media for more than a decade. The assistants for both teams are all women.\nAware of McGraw\u2019s vow not to hire another man, Auriemma pulled no punches when he responded this week.\n\u201cI hope she sends a thank you to all those guys that used to be on her staff that got her all those good players that won a championship,\u201d he said.\nAuriemma\u2019s leading recruiter for 34 seasons has been the associate head coach, Chris Dailey. While building teams that won 11 N.C.A.A. titles at Connecticut, Dailey has been offered countless head coaching jobs, but she stayed to sustain the Huskies\u2019 success.\n\u201cWomen can be empowered by a lot of people, men included,\u201d Dailey said after McGraw spoke on Thursday. \u201cOpportunity for women is important, and it\u2019s being brought to the forefront, which is amazing. But I do think you want good people in the game without excluding anyone.\u201d\nAuriemma has long been an advocate for women in the sport, but he disagreed with the idea of limiting opportunities for men.\n\u201cI just come at it from a different standpoint,\u201d he said Thursday. \u201cI just like to think that there\u2019s probably a way to do one without the expense of another.\u201d\nHe pointed to Oregon Coach Kelly Graves, the other man coaching in the Final Four this weekend. \u201cSo they weren\u2019t trying to advance women\u2019s basketball or women by hiring Kelly? That was a bad move? They should have just found the best available woman?\u201d", "date": "April 4, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/sports/womens-final-four-muffet-mcgraw.html", "tags": "basketball coach tell let men hire man coaching staff \u201d says women enough mcgraw muffet"}
