{"title": "'Game Of Thrones' Star Says Every Episode Of Season 8 Is 'Monumental'", "content": "It sounds like \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d Season 8 won\u2019t be the Sam old thing.\nNews recently broke that the final season\u2019s episodes could come in at around $15 million each, and that the show will bring back directors\u00a0Miguel Sapochnik\u00a0and David Nutter.\n\u201cWe assembled a team of directors this year who have been in charge of some of our big episodes in the past,\u201d\u00a0John Bradley, who plays Sam Tarly on the show, told HuffPost.\u00a0\u201cMiguel and David have done some of the standout episodes of previous seasons. Clearly every single episode of the six you\u2019ve got left in Season 8 is gonna be monumental and needs somebody at the helm who\u2019s done that kind of high-stakes, high-octane direction before for us.\u201d\n\u201cI think what we used to call Episode 9 in \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019\u00a0folklore\u00a0\u2014 the episode when everything comes to a head and you get a lot of spectacular sequences\u00a0\u2014 I think you\u2019re gonna get six \u2018Episode 9s\u2019 this year,\u201d Bradley added.\u00a0\u201cYou can tell that because we\u2019ve got directors who have been in charge of some of the most huge setpieces in the past doing episodes all throughout the season.\u201d\nShowrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss are set to direct the finale, which Bradley calls \u201cpoetic.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s in the right hands there,\u201d the actor said.\u00a0\u201cThey know everything about the show.\u00a0They\u2019ve been in charge of everything \u2015 every key decision in all seven seasons so far has been made by David and Dan. I think they\u2019ve done an incredible job with this series. They deserve everything they get, and they deserve the right to finish this show off in the way they see fit. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anybody better qualified, so I can\u2019t wait.\u201d\nThe actor continued talking to HuffPost about \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d\u00a0explaining the reason Sam seemed to take credit for Gilly\u2019s (Hannah Murray) big discovery on the show, and opened up about his upcoming project, \u201cAmerican Satan,\u201d\u00a0a supernatural thriller about a rock band that may find itself in an actual deal with the devil.\nHow do you fit in other projects while doing \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d?\nIt\u2019s a little different this year because the way the schedule works out, but usually you have the last six months of the year taken by\u00a0\u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d\u00a0and the first six months of the year you\u2019re pretty much free to do whatever you want.\u00a0So that\u2019s been nice over the last few years \u2015 the fact that we have all this time to play around with things and do different projects and venture into slightly uncharted territory as far as our careers are concerned, but knowing that we have this security, that we have this brilliant thing to go back to in the last six months of the year. That\u2019s kind of a really nice comfort blanket.\nWe filmed\u00a0[\u201cAmerican Satan\u201d] a long time ago now. We filmed it spring 2016 \u2014 March, April 2016. Yeah, it was a long time ago. This is the way they go with movies, the fact that you filmed them so long ago.\u00a0You\u2019ve kind of forgotten about them and you kind of have to refresh your memory before you can talk about them again. \u201cAmerican Satan,\u201d we\u2019re talking a good 18 months ago now.\nSo how did you refresh your memory?\nBy just reading the original script again, watching the movie for the first time, and kind of being reminded of that shooting experience, which was a strange shooting experience.\u00a0On \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d we\u2019re so used to having lots of time to shoot and a lot at our disposal, and \u201cAmerican Satan\u201d was a little bit different, much more kind of a self-sufficient, resourceful thing going on. We had to shoot when we could on this project in this slightly less formulaic way. It\u2019s a much less orthodox way of filming than I\u2019m used to.\nThat\u2019s one of the things that first attracted me to it. I\u2019ve done indie movies before, and I often like the kind of danger of them, that little bit of uncertainty, and that little bit of energy that comes from a group of people who have to make choices artistically and solve problems artistically when you don\u2019t necessarily have a lot of money to throw at a problem.\nWhat can you tell us about your character, Ricky Rollins?\nAll the characters that I play tend to be in quite dark places, psychologically, and\u00a0[don\u2019t have]\u00a0that much faith in themselves. They\u2019re crippled by self-doubt or low self-esteem or envy of other people or a dissatisfaction with life. They\u2019re such great characters to play because you can deal with internal conflict, and you can deal with all those dark psychological areas a character like Samwell, especially, basically inhabits.\nThe thing that I found refreshing about this film is that I play a character for the first time really [who\u2019s] beaming with self-confidence. He\u2019s absolutely overflowing with self-confidence. He has absolute belief in himself and it may be deluded. It may be completely misguided belief in his own ability, but he has them. He can go into any room in any situation and take it by the scruff of the neck because he believes he is Superman. He believes he is bulletproof. This guy has not got any of that crippling Samwell Tarly self-doubt. He\u2019s got absolute\u00a0\u2014 perhaps wrongfully, but\u00a0\u2014 absolute belief in himself.\nMalcolm McDowell is in this movie. Did you talk about \u201cA Clockwork Orange,\u201d or is that taboo to bring up?\nTwelve months before \u201cAmerican Satan\u201d started shooting, I really became a kind of [Stanley] Kubrick obsessive ... then when I found out Malcolm McDowell was in this movie I was so desperate to get him to talk about it, and so I thought, \u201cI\u2019m gonna ask him everything. This is going to be direct about what it\u2019s like to work with Stanley Kubrick.\u201d And then I thought, \u201cWell, maybe he wants to get away from all that. Maybe he talked enough about \u2018A Clockwork Orange.\u2019 Maybe he just sees that as one movie in his career, and he\u2019s done lots of other great things he might want to talk about. Maybe he\u2019s sick of talking about Kubrick.\u201d\nI kind of danced around the issue for a long time, and I wanted to bring it up so often\u00a0\u2014 just kind of pin him down and get him on my own where I could finally ask him the question, \u201cWhat was it like?\u201d and hopefully he has some stories about him. I knew I had to walk on eggshells around\u00a0[McDowell] a little bit because he may not be quite fond of me. I found out he\u2019s very, very happy to talk about Stanley Kubrick.\nI think he\u2019s still incredibly proud to have worked with him and have that association with him.\u00a0He told a famous story about Kubrick trying to con Malcolm out of money [...] I heard that story before when I was getting beamed into my Kubrick fascination,\u00a0but to hear it from Malcolm and to hear him talk about those days in vivid detail, I really got an impression of what it was like to work with Kubrick.\nIn \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d Season 7, there\u2019s a scene where Gilly seems to uncover that Prince Rhaegar had an annulment, but Sam cuts her off. Then he brings up that info later to Bran. A lot of people on Twitter were upset, but what do you think about what happened?\nSam hasn\u2019t consciously plagiarized Gilly\u2019s idea there. He\u2019s not giving her the elbow. He\u2019s not really necessary taking credit for someone else\u2019s work because \u2026\u00a0Sam heard that because he\u2019s so good at processing information now. He can take information in, almost subconsciously, and almost without thinking about it. His eyes and his ears are constantly attuned to absorbing information, so he\u2019s able to absorb that without even necessarily thinking about it.\u00a0Sam is like a radio, and if there\u2019s information in the air, he will pick it up, and he will store it whenever he needs it.\nIt\u2019s not about him\u00a0... taking credit for her idea. He probably wasn\u2019t even aware of where he heard that information.\u00a0He just knows he heard it somewhere in the air, and he was able to pick it up and process it.\u00a0\nWhat I will say that in fairness, Gilly did tell Sam that, and Sam didn\u2019t necessarily say that Gilly was the one who started that, but Jorah Mormont didn\u2019t go back to Daenerys saying Samwell Tarly cured him of greyscale.\u00a0He\u2019s not gone back there name-checking Sam for saving his life. He\u2019s not mentioned the name Samwell Tarly to Jon Snow or Daenerys, so Sam\u2019s not getting his credit there for something he actually did.\nAlthough Sam is taking a little bit of credit for something that he didn\u2019t do, he\u2019s also not getting credit for something that he actually did, so I think in terms of the equilibrium, he\u2019s getting just the right amount of credit from a slightly different source than he probably deserved.\n\u201cAmerican Satan\u201d is in theaters Oct. 13.\nThis interview has been edited and condensed.", "date": "\n10/03/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/game-of-thrones-star-says-every-episode-of-season-8-is-monumental_n_59cd078ce4b05063fe0f8ec1", "tags": "like credit game think episode sam season every \u201d says thrones time star kind"}
