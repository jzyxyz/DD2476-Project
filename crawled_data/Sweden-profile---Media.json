{"title": "Sweden profile - Media", "content": "Sweden is a major force in Scandinavian media and is home to regional media giants Bonnier and Modern Times Group (MTG).\nTV remains the most popular medium, with radio and online media at its heels.\nPublic Sveriges Television's (SVT) main competitor is privately-owned TV4. Most households have multichannel TV. \nPublic Sveriges Radio runs national and regional networks. Some privately-owned radio networks have near-national coverage.\nThe government subsidises newspapers regardless of their political stance. Papers tend not to have formal links to a political party. Instead, they are described in terms such as \"independent liberal\" or \"independent conservative\".\nSwedes have traditionally been avid newspaper readers, but the press is under pressure from digital rivals.\nSweden rates highly for media freedom. It occupied number two position in the Reporters Without Borders 2018 World Press Freedom Index, behind Norway.  \nBy December 2017, around 9.6 million Swedes were online - nearly 97% of the population (InternetWorldStats). \nFacebook is by far the most popular social media platform.", "date": "3 October 2018", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17961251", "tags": "tv public media privately-owned profile popular online sveriges radio regional sweden"}
