{"title": "The Number Of Anti-Muslim Hate Groups In The U-S- Tripled In 2016", "content": "The number of anti-Muslim hate groups in the U.S. nearly tripled in 2016 partly because of\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s rise to political power, suggests a new report.\nThere were 34 such groups in the U.S. in 2015 and 101 last year, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s Annual Census of Hate Groups\u00a0published Wednesday. That\u2019s a 197 percent rise and \u201cby the far the most dramatic change\u201d among extremist groups in the U.S.\n\u201cAnti-Muslim hate has been expanding rapidly for more than two years now, driven by radical Islamist attacks including the June mass murder of 49 people at an Orlando, Fla., gay nightclub, the unrelenting propaganda of a growing circle of well-paid ideologues, and the incendiary rhetoric of Trump \u2014 his threats to ban Muslim immigration, mandate a registry of Muslims in America, and more,\u201d Mark Potok, a senior fellow at SPLC, wrote in the report\nThe anti-Muslim groups listed in the report consider Islam an inherently evil political ideology \u2015 not a religion \u2015\u00a0that uniformly sanctions violence, pedophilia and a host of other crimes.\u00a0\nMoreover, the groups earnestly believe in conspiracy theories\u00a0saying Muslims are somehow subversively trying to replace governments in America and Europe with Islamic theocracies bent on implementing a brutal interpretation of Shariah, or Islamic law.\u00a0\nWhile many of these groups were once relegated to the fringes of American politics, they now hold real influence in the Trump administration.\u00a0\nAlmost 50 of the new additions to the SPLC\u2019s list of anti-Muslim hate groups were local chapters of Act for America, an organization whose national founder\u00a0bragged in a December email of having a \u201cdirect line\u201d to the White House.\u00a0\nMichael Flynn, who resigned as Trump\u2019s national security adviser on Tuesday, was a board member for Act for America. Mike Pompeo, who Trump picked to head up the CIA, also has deep ties to the group: He once\u00a0sponsored\u00a0a legislative briefing on Capitol Hill for the group, and accepted Act for America\u2019s National Security Eagle Award for 2016.\u00a0\nJeff Sessions, the new attorney general, is closely affiliated with a hate group called the David Horowitz Freedom Center \u2015 he once accepted an award from the organization, and regularly speaks at its events.\u00a0\nSteve Bannon, Trump\u2019s chief strategist who now sits on the National Security Council, has praised anti-Muslim hate group leaders as experts on Islam \u2015 most notably the paranoid conspiracy theorist Frank Gaffney, who heads the Center for Security Policy. \u00a0\nAnd Kellyanne Conway, a White House counselor and frequent Trump spokeswoman, conducted a deeply flawed poll for Gaffney\u2019s organization. It claimed that 20 percent of Muslims in the U.S. think \u201cthe use of violence in the United States is justified in order to make Shariah the law of the land in this country.\u201d These results came from an opt-in survey, which the American Association for Public Opinion Research says means the \u201cthe pollster has no idea who is responding to the question.\u201d The CSP poll was also packed with loaded and misleading questions.\nThe influence of anti-Muslim hate groups was readily apparent during Trump\u2019s campaign. He cited Conway\u2019s poll, for example, while calling for a complete shutdown of Muslims entering the country.\nTrump also proposed creating a\u00a0national database of Muslims, and voiced support for\u00a0surveilling mosques\u00a0and profiling Muslims.\u00a0He frequently told an apocryphal story about shooting Muslims with bullets dipped in pig blood, and once suggested that the Muslim mother of a fallen American soldier wasn\u2019t allowed to talk. He also once declared,\u00a0\u201cIslam hates us.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a financial explanation for this kind of anti-Muslim hate in national politics,\u00a0Potok said.\u00a0\n\u201cThe anti-Muslim groups are the best-funded of radical right-wing groups in this country,\u201d he told reporters in a conference call Wednesday. The groups have received\u00a0millions of dollars\u00a0in funding in recent years to peddle fear and misinformation about Islam and Muslims.\u00a0\nPotok said David Horowitz, of the David Horowitz Freedom Center, earned $567,000 in 2014. Gaffney, of the Center for Security Policy,\u00a0earned $200,000 in 2011, according to a report from Georgetown University.\u00a0\n\u201cHating Muslims pays well,\u201d Potok said.\u00a0\nThe SPLC-listed groups generally dispute the label of \u201chate group.\u201d Gaffney told The Huffington Post\u00a0last year that the SPLC is \u201cessentially acting as an agent of the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamic supremacists\u201d in labeling groups like his as hateful.\u00a0\nOutside the world of professional, suit-and-tie Islamophobia, according to the SPLC report, American militia \u201cPatriot\u201d groups, such as III% Security Force,\u00a0became increasingly anti-Muslim in nature in 2016.\nMost notably, three Trump-supporting militia members were arrested in Kansas in October for plotting to bomb an apartment complex in order to kill some 120 Muslim immigrants from Somalia who lived there.\u00a0\nAnd as the number of anti-Muslim hate groups has grown, so has the number of anti-Muslim hate crimes. There was a 67 percent rise in hate crimes\u00a0targeting Muslims in 2015, according to the FBI, which hasn\u2019t released its hate crime numbers for 2016.\u00a0\nHuffPost\u00a0tracked nearly 400 incidents of anti-Muslim violence, vandalism, policy and political speech in 2016; we also identified at least 13 times Trump supporters attacked, threatened or plotted to kill American Muslims.\u00a0\nAccording to Potok, the way our nation\u2019s political leaders talk about Muslims greatly influences anti-Muslim hate.\u00a0\nAlthough there was a steep rise in anti-Muslim hate crimes in the three months after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, the number of hate crimes dropped dramatically in 2002. This, Potok said, happened largely due to then-President George W. Bush repeatedly saying that \u201cArabs and Muslims aren\u2019t our enemy ... our enemy is a very specific group called al Qaeda.\u201d\u00a0\nCompare that to the 1,094 hate incidents targeting all minority groups that the SPLC says it documented in the 34 days after Trump\u2019s election victory. Over 300 of those incidents targeted Muslims and immigrants, and more than one-third of the perpetrators directly\u00a0\u201creferenced either Trump, his \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 slogan, or his infamous remarks about grabbing women by the genitals.\u201d\u00a0\nThe SPLC report found the overall number of hate groups operating in 2016 rose to 917 \u2015 up from 892 in 2015. That\u2019s a high number by historic standards, the SPLC said, although not as high as the 1,018 hate groups it identified in 2011.\u00a0\nIn addition to anti-Muslim groups, the SPLC also identified groups that were white nationalist, affiliated with the KKK, anti-immigrant, anti-LGBT, black separatist and anti-Semitic.\nTrump\u2019s election, Potok said, \u201chas been absolutely electrifying to the radical right.\u201d\nPotok added, however, that the SPLC report likely understates \u201cthe real state of the radical right in the U.S.\u201d\u00a0\nBecause although many people are members of\u00a0\u201cbrick-and-mortar hate groups on the ground,\u201d there are many more who aren\u2019t affiliated with formal groups, instead \u201clurking on the internet until the day they decide that action is needed.\u201d\u00a0\nSuch was the case with Dylann Roof, a white supremacist who killed nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. Potok said Roof \u201cdecided based solely on what he was reading on the internet\u201d that \u201cblack people needed to die.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWe think there are a lot of Dylann Roofs out there,\u201d Potok said.\u00a0", "date": "\n02/15/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/anti-muslim-hate-groups-triple-southern-poverty-law-center_n_58a46e2ee4b03df370dc2d9a?dr0txjuyvznx0qkt9", "tags": "groups anti-muslim hate u-s- tripled muslims \u201d potok splc number"}
