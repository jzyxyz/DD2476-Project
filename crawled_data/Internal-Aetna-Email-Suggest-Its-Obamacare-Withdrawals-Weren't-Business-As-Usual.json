{"title": "Internal Aetna Email Suggest Its Obamacare Withdrawals Weren't Business As Usual", "content": "Insurance giant Aetna\u2019s decision last summer to shut down its Affordable Care Act\u00a0plans in 11 states created a ton of bad publicity for the law.\nOver and over again, Obamacare\u2019s political opponents, including then-presidential candidate Donald Trump, cited the company\u2019s withdrawals as proof that insurance carriers were losing money and the new state insurance exchanges were falling apart.\nAetna executives backed up those arguments by citing poor financial performance as a reason for its withdrawals.\nBut internal company communications suggest that, in three states, Aetna had other motives: It was trying to win approval of its controversial bid to merge with Humana.\nSome of the plans that Aetna shut down were actually making money, the documents indicate. And Aetna remained optimistic that Obamacare plans would be profitable in the long run.\nTaken together, these new pieces of evidence would seem like a reminder not to take every report of Obamacare trouble at face value.\u00a0\nThe information came to light on Monday, when Senior U.S.\u00a0District Judge John Bates upheld a decision by the Justice Department to block the Aetna-Humana merger \u2015 a decision that Aetna has said it may appeal. (The company did not respond to requests for comment.)\nIn his ruling, Judge Bates didn\u2019t simply concur with the Justice Department\u2019s finding that an Aetna-Humana merger would reduce competition and harm consumers. He also said that \u201cAetna tried to leverage its participation in the exchanges for favorable treatment from [the Justice Department] regarding the proposed merger.\u201d After Justice rejected the merger, Bates said, Aetna pulled insurance offerings from Florida, Georgia and Missouri in part \u201cto follow through on the threat that it made earlier.\u201d\nTo prove his point, Bates cited a series of emails, financial documents and testimony about verbal conversations involving Aetna officials over the past several months.\nHere, for example, is what Aetna Chairman and CEO Mark Bertolini said to Sylvia Burwell, then the secretary of health and human services, during a July phone conversation: \u201cIf, by chance, you get a reach-out from the [Justice Department] about us as a candidate for this merger, I would appreciate a good word for all that we\u2019ve done with you.\u201d\u00a0\nAnd here is how Bertolini groused about Justice Department scrutiny to a former Aetna official: \u201cThe administration has a very short memory, absolutely no loyalty and a very thin skin,\u201d he said in an email.\nAetna\u2019s motives for withdrawing from Obamacare exchanges first came into question in August, after The Huffington Post obtained a letter\u00a0that Bertolini had sent to the Department of Health and Human Services earlier in the summer.\nIn that letter, Bertolini warned that rejection of the merger by Justice Department regulators would lead Aetna \u201cto reduce our 2017 exchange footprint.\u201d\nAt the time, and later during testimony for the federal lawsuit, Aetna officials said that the company was simply explaining its business position \u2015 that, without the economic benefits of the merger, it could not afford to sustain losses in the Obamacare exchanges.\nBates acknowledged in his decision that Aetna was among the insurers losing money on Obamacare policies and that those losses could have been a factor in considering whether to eliminate insurance plans.\u00a0\nBut, the judge said, internal company documents suggested the company remained optimistic about the long-term prospects for the exchanges and was seriously considering expansion, even after learning about its 2016 losses.\u00a0\nIn addition, Bates noted, some of Aetna\u2019s plans were already profitable, including the Florida policies that it canceled. In fact, when an company official in charge of Aetna\u2019s Florida plans learned of the decision to shut them down, he responded incredulously. \u201cI just can\u2019t make sense out of the Florida decision,\u201d he wrote in an email, adding later, \u201cWe are making money from the on-exchange business. Was Florida\u2019s performance ever debated?\u201d\nAnother reason Aetna decided to shutter those Florida, Georgia and Missouri plans, the judge said, was to reduce overlap with Humana\u2019s offerings and thereby strengthen its case challenging the Justice Department\u2019s disapproval of the merger.\u00a0Bates even cited evidence that Aetna tried to shield its internal communications on this matter under attorney-client privilege. At one point, an Aetna official talking about plans wrote, \u201cI was told to be careful about putting any of that in writing. I will have the attorney client privilege ccd by tomorrow.\u201d\nWhen deposed, the official acknowledged that he was trying to avoid disclosure of these communications in the antitrust litigation and that Aetna officials had decided to carry on further conversations by phone in order to avoid a paper trail that could come out in legal proceedings.\nIt would appear the effort was not so successful.\nCORRECTION: The highlighted quotes came from Aetna emails sent in the summer of 2016, not 2017.\nSign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.
