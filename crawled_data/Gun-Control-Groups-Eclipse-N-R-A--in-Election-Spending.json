{"title": "Gun Control Groups Eclipse N.R.A. in Election Spending", "content": "Amid a numbing succession of mass shootings, gun control groups outspent the National Rifle Association in the midterm election cycle, federal filings and additional reporting indicate, upending the usual order in the partisan battle over gun use.\nTwo groups that are focused on gun control, Giffords and Everytown for Gun Safety, spent at least $37 million at the state and federal level in the midterms, compared with at least $20 million by the N.R.A. The figures are incomplete, because some of the spending done by such groups is not required to be disclosed, but all sides agreed that the N.R.A. was outspent, stemming a trend of financial dominance for the N.R.A. going back years.\nDespite being outspent in one election cycle, the N.R.A. remains a potent force in American politics. Much of the organization\u2019s impact comes in its ability to mobilize millions of members, and it continues to wield a prodigious fund-raising and lobbying machine, and a hold on the Republican Party that will make any advancements of gun control a challenge.\nBut the N.R.A. has also arguably gained its most formidable counterweight since its emergence as a modern political force in the late 1970s.\nThe development also comes as the N.R.A. has been buffeted by challenges, among them the proliferation of mass shootings, including recent massacres at a Pittsburgh synagogue and a California bar. The group is also in the midst of a legal battle with New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and state regulators over a controversial insurance plan it offers to gun owners. A report by the Center for Responsive Politics found that N.R.A. membership dues plummeted last year, though the group has said subscribers increased at its magazines this year.\nThis month, the N.R.A. started a Twitter feud by telling doctors to \u201cstay in their lane\u201d and attacking the research of groups like the American College of Physicians, which has called gun violence a \u201cpublic health crisis.\u201d A flood of responses followed, like one  forensic pathologist who wrote, \u201cThis is my lane.\u201d\nOne of the biggest factors in the financial turnabout in the gun debate has been the involvement of Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York who recently became a Democrat and is mulling a 2020 presidential bid. In addition to providing about a third of Everytown\u2019s budget, he is the sole funder of Independence USA, a political action committee that spent about $60 million in the cycle.\nMr. Bloomberg created Everytown four years ago as an umbrella organization for gun control causes, and his spending initially focused on ballot initiatives and state elections, according to tax documents. Now both Everytown and Giffords are challenging the N.R.A. at the federal level as the N.R.A.\u2019s spending has declined compared with the last midterms, filings show.\nAnd while Independence USA does not solely focus on gun control, it was a central issue in an advertisement featuring Mr. Bloomberg himself, as well as ads in support of  Chrissy Houlahan, who won a congressional seat in a district outside Philadelphia, and for Jason Crow, who won a seat in the Denver area.\nBoth sides claimed victory after the election.\n\u201cDespite record spending by anti-gun billionaires like Michael Bloomberg, the gun control lobby once again failed to win elections,\u201d said Jennifer Baker, an N.R.A. spokeswoman.\nJohn Feinblatt, Everytown\u2019s president, countered with a different interpretation: \u201cThere\u2019s no question in our mind 2018 will be remembered as the year of gun safety and will be a reset moment.\u201d\nBoth the N.R.A. and Everytown said about 80 percent of the candidates they endorsed won. Elections, of course, are won at the margins \u2014 outside of the 80 percent. And it was swing districts that helped tilt the House back to the Democrats, often aided by gun-control groups.\nGiffords, a group co-founded by the former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who was wounded in a 2011 assassination attempt, concentrated its resources in a few races. The group focused on four incumbent House members who have received A ratings from the N.R.A. \u2014 John Culberson, in the Houston area; Mike Coffman in Colorado; Barbara Comstock in Northern Virginia and Jason Lewis in Minnesota.\nGiffords poured nearly $5 million combined into those contests, helping to make guns a front burner issue in the races. All four incumbents lost.\n\u201cWe\u2019re on the rise, and they\u2019re on the decline,\u201d said Peter Ambler, the executive director of the Giffords PAC.\nEverytown, among other efforts, spent $5 million on an advertising campaign called \u201cNot One More\u201d in 16 districts that didn\u2019t have Democratic incumbents. Their preferred candidates prevailed in 15 of those races. (In the 16th, Representative Ann Wagner, a Missouri Republican, held her seat.)\nThe N.R.A., however, was buoyed by Representative Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, a staunch gun rights advocate who held an open Senate seat for the Republican Party. Their favored candidate also prevailed in Missouri, where Josh Hawley, the state attorney general, defeated the longtime Democratic incumbent, Senator Claire McCaskill. Oliver North, the N.R.A.\u2019s president, campaigned with Mr. Hawley in the race\u2019s closing days.\n\u201cN.R.A. efforts in pivotal U.S. Senate races were key to growing the pro-Second Amendment majority in the Senate, which will ensure the confirmation of federal judicial appointees who respect the Second Amendment,\u201d Ms. Baker, the N.R.A. spokeswoman, said.\nHow much of an impact either side ultimately has on any particular race is hard to say. Guns ranked third in importance among voters in an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll over the summer and sixth in a Pew survey. Mr. Crow won a seat in Colorado\u2019s Sixth Congressional District, which includes the Aurora movie theater that was the site of a 2012 massacre, by making gun control a central issue. In other races, like Ms. Houlahan\u2019s win in Pennsylvania\u2019s Sixth District, it was one of many factors.\nBut gun-control groups are becoming more aggressive. After the N.R.A. removed archival records of its high-profile, oft-cited candidate grades from its website this year, Everytown posted the data on its own website.\n\u201cThose grades used to be seen as a kingmaker at election time,\u201d said Mr. Feinblatt, the Everytown president, who said they were now \u201ca scarlet letter\u201d for many swing voters.\nN.R.A. officials have scoffed at that, and said they merely reformatted the group\u2019s website.\n\u201cAfter the election they are no longer relevant,\u201d Ms. Baker said.\nIn any case, both sides will have their champions in the new Congress.\nHours after a mass shooting took place at a bar in Thousand Oaks, Calif., Ms. Blackburn, who has an A rating from the N.R.A., said on Fox that it was important to \u201cprotect the Second Amendment\u201d as well as citizens.\nThat was in contrast to Lucy McBath, a former Delta flight attendant who won a Georgia congressional seat. Ms. McBath became an activist for Everytown after her 17-year-old son was shot and killed in 2012.\n\u201cIt is unfortunately not surprising that on the same day I officially became a Congresswoman-Elect, other families in this country are receiving the same exact call that I did six years ago,\u201d she tweeted after Thousand Oaks. \u201cI pledge to do everything I can to make our communities safer.\u201d", "date": "Nov. 16, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/16/us/politics/nra-gun-control-fund-raising.html", "tags": "groups election control everytown n.r.a eclipse gun \u201d giffords seat spending"}
