{"title": "The Global Economy Was Improving. Then, the World\u2019s Two Largest Economies Resumed Warring.", "content": "LONDON \u2014 In ordinary times, worries about the health of the global economy tend to prompt leaders of the largest countries to join forces in pursuit of safety.\nThese are not ordinary times.\nThe biggest threat to global fortunes has become the intensifying conflict between the two largest economies on earth, the United States and China. As their leaders openly contemplate how to inflict pain on each other, the rest of the world now frets about becoming collateral damage in an escalating trade war.\nOnly a week ago, China and the United States appeared to be moving toward cooling their hostilities, while global economic prospects were improving. Worries about a worldwide slowdown were giving way to burnished hopes for expansion.\nFears about the weakening of China\u2019s economy were easing as President Trump advertised a soon-to-be-signed trade deal. That lifted the outlook for Asian economies dependent on global commerce like Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. Europe, a perpetual source of concern, was flashing signs of renewal. Defying skeptics, the American economy remained on a tear.\nBut late last week, as Mr. Trump sharply increased tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, the world found itself grappling with the likelihood that the trade war will cost treasure. The concern mounted on Monday as Beijing retaliated and the Trump administration detailed plans to slap 25 percent tariffs on virtually all goods that China sends to the United States.\nFor businesses and consumers alike, it all raised the prospect that they would soon be paying higher prices for goods, a reality that discourages commerce.\n\u201cAn escalation scenario would be terrible all around,\u201d said Gabriel Sterne, head of global macro research at Oxford Economics in London. \u201cA negative impact on trade flow is going to be bad for global growth for several years. It\u2019s bad news for almost everybody.\u201d\nIf both sides follow through on their threatened tariffs, China\u2019s annual economic output will be reduced by 0.8 percent while the United States will see its annual growth reduced by 0.3 percent, according to Oxford Economics.\nThose numbers are small in the grand scheme of things, but the pain could be felt acutely within industries that are especially exposed to the trade war, such as American agriculture and Chinese electronics manufacturers.\nThe harm could be especially severe for countries that are most dependent on trade, including Singapore, Malaysia, Mexico and Japan.\nAt the center of trouble sits China, the world\u2019s most populous country. Its breakneck development over recent decades has added hundreds of millions of consumers to the global marketplace while supplying a vast assemblage of low-cost goods.\nGiven that China is the source of roughly one-third of the world\u2019s economic growth, any disruption to its trade amounts to a global event.\nMr. Trump has designed his tariffs to wound China as he seeks to pressure its leaders to agree to cease subsidizing state-owned companies, stop demanding intellectual property from American businesses and open its markets to foreign competitors. Until last week, the president was insisting that a trade deal with China was imminent. Then, he abruptly accused China of reneging on its commitments and opted to increase tariffs.\nThe sharp escalation comes at an especially fraught time for the world economy, jeopardizing what had seemed to be a stabilizing, if gradually slowing Chinese economy.\nVolumes of freight imported by China surged in April, according to an analysis of data by UBS, the global investment bank. Worldwide, airfreight was up in March compared with a year earlier, according to the International Air Transport Association.\nBut these trends are fragile. Airfreight has declined nearly 4 percent since its peak in 2017. Outside China, manufacturing in Asia has been slowing for much of the last two years. A trade war between the United States and China \u2014 two countries that collectively account for roughly 40 percent of world economic output \u2014 would almost certainly aggravate the situation.\nExports to China from Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam have plunged by about 14 percent over the past year, or about $6.3 billion, according to analysis from Oxford Economics.\nThose same countries have lifted their exports to the United States by a similar percentage. But the United States is a less important trading partner, and the increase amounts to less than $2 billion.\nIn Europe, the trade war presents another unwanted source of concern at a time of tenuous progress.\nConcerns that Britain\u2019s unruly departure from the European Union would damage trade across the continent had abated \u2014 at least in the immediate term \u2014 as London and Brussels agreed to extend their fractious divorce proceedings until the end of October.\nGermany, the Continent\u2019s largest economy, had been moderating fears of weakness, with data showing an increase in factory orders and exports. Germany\u2019s exports to China were up by more than 5 percent in March compared with a year earlier.\nBut much of what Germany sends China amounts to the piece parts of China\u2019s industrial apparatus \u2014 car parts, engines, electrical machinery and other gear folded into factory operations. If Chinese factory operations slow in the face of American tariffs, China\u2019s appetite for German goods will most likely wane.\nIn Italy and France, industrial activity has been weakening in recent months.\n\u201cFor Europe, it\u2019s happening at a very delicate point in time,\u201d said Kjersti Haugland, chief economist at DNB Markets, an investment bank in Norway. \u201cYou have growth being very feeble again.\u201d\nThe trade war has already spooked global stock markets, prompting plunges in share prices that slightly reversed on Tuesday.\nIf investor fear deepens, money will almost certainly flow into the ultimate safe haven, the American dollar. That would most likely be accompanied by money leaving so-called emerging markets, exacerbating crises in Argentina and Turkey, while bringing down the value of currencies more broadly, from Brazil to South Africa to India.\nFalling currencies make imported goods more expensive in those countries, forcing poor people to pay more for food, fuel and transportation.\nAfter rising early this year, currencies and stock prices across emerging markets have dipped precipitously in recent weeks.\nThe key question now is how long trade hostilities will endure.\nIt is a question with no clear answer.\nMr. Trump appears to be taking resolve from a strong American economy as he declares a willingness to absorb the strains of a drawn-out battle with China. The unemployment rate sits at 3.6 percent, its lowest level in half a century. The economy expanded at a 3.2 percent annual clip during the first three months of the year.\nMr. Trump has declared that the United States can win a trade war if it stays the course. Yet he has also used Twitter to complain that the Federal Reserve is not cutting interest rates while China\u2019s leaders stimulate their economy with injections of credit.\nPerhaps that represents his lobbying for lower rates. It can also be read as an admission that Mr. Trump lacks \u2014 and covets \u2014 tools possessed by his adversaries in Beijing, who enjoy domination of the levers of policy.\nMr. Trump\u2019s strategy appears to be stoking nationalist anger in China, where the Communist Party government leans heavily on such sentiments for propaganda purposes. That could harden China\u2019s willingness to hold its position, as its leaders fear the consequences of gratifying an attack from the American leader.\nIt is not a recipe for expanded global trade, which grew by about 4 percent in 2017, then slowed to 2 percent last year and may contract this year.\n\u201cOnce growth in trade volumes turns negative, it makes us all have to take a closer look at some sort of recession scenario,\u201d said Marie Owens Thomsen, global chief economist at Indosuez Wealth Management in Geneva. \u201cThings are looking more disconcerting for sure. The downside risks are increasing.\u201d", "date": "May 15, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/business/us-china-trade-war-economy.html", "tags": "largest warring world percent china united states global economy improving resumed war two trade economies \u2014"}
