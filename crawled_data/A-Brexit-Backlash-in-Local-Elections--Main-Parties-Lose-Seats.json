{"title": "A Brexit Backlash in Local Elections: Main Parties Lose Seats", "content": "LONDON \u2014 For months, there has been little doubt that the British electorate is disgusted, disillusioned and furious with the political dysfunction and the chaos of Brexit. But there hadn\u2019t been an outlet for the public to vent that anger \u2014 until now.\nAcross much of England, election results for around 8,400 local seats, tabulated on Friday, delivered a vicious backlash against the country\u2019s two main political parties, the governing Conservatives and the Labour opposition. The Conservatives lost more than 1,300 seats, while Labour lost around 80.\n\u201cWhat the voters have been saying is, \u2018A plague on both your houses,\u2019\u201d Britain\u2019s leading polling expert, John Curtice, a professor of politics at the University of Strathclyde, told the BBC.\nIt was a furious electoral tidal wave with unlikely winners: The centrist Liberal Democrats, Greens and Independents picked up hundreds of seats, even as they are marginalized in Parliament. Still, the local results seem unlikely to immediately alter the paralyzed state of Brexit, although that will be tested next week when talks resume between the Conservatives and Labour to try to find a compromise.\nFor now, Britain seems stuck in a feedback loop, even as the country is facing the likelihood of holding European parliamentary elections in less than three weeks, despite trying to leave the bloc.\nThe calculus in Parliament, where lawmakers have been unable to pass much of anything, remains unchanged.\n\u201cWe have the same situation as before \u2014 only more so,\u201d said Anand Menon, professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King\u2019s College London. \u201cThe incentives to agree to something are now greater, but the constraints on anyone\u2019s ability to deliver that are probably greater, too.\u201d\nWhile the results increase pressure on political leaders to strike a deal across party lines on Brexit, their internal critics who strongly support or oppose Brexit are likely to be more implacably opposed to any possible solution, leaving a stalemate, Mr. Menon said.\nThe infighting among Conservatives seems certain to continue: The local results summoned calls yet again for Prime Minister Theresa May to resign.\nHer rival, the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, is under pressure from the pro-Brexit and anti-Brexit wings of his own party. The local results show that Mr. Corbyn\u2019s balancing act over Brexit, designed to appease both supporters and opponents of withdrawal, is pleasing neither side, presenting him with an excruciating dilemma.\nSome lawmakers representing pro-Brexit areas, mainly in the north and middle of England, want Mr. Corbyn to agree next week on a plan to help Mrs. May push withdrawal through a deadlocked Parliament in the hope that this will defuse the crisis.\nOn Friday, Mr. Corbyn acknowledged that pressure when he told ITV News: \u201cAn arrangement has to be made, a deal has to be done, Parliament has to resolve this issue. I think that is very, very clear.\u201d\nBut an equally vocal faction, representing most of the party\u2019s members, wants Labour to commit to putting any Brexit agreement back to the voters in a referendum with an option to remain in the bloc \u2014 an idea that Mr. Corbyn has so far resisted.\nAs for Mrs. May, her position is under more pressure than ever, though she has already promised to stand aside once her Brexit withdrawal agreement has been approved. In a new low for her premiership, she was heckled on Friday at a meeting of her own party members in Wales by a former county councilor, Stuart Davies, who called for her to resign.\nMrs. May, who is nothing if not stubborn, acknowledged in her speech to Conservative Party members in Wales that the results of Thursday\u2019s elections had been \u201cvery difficult.\u201d Mr. Corbyn, for his part, speaking in the north of England, said he was disappointed by the results and \u201cwanted to do better.\u201d\nThough big losses had been predicted for the Conservative Party, with many questioning Mrs. May\u2019s leadership over Brexit, Labour\u2019s disappointing performance was more of a surprise, analysts said, particularly given the recent chaos surrounding Mrs. May\u2019s government.\nAccording to a BBC projection, the Conservatives and Labour would tie at just 28 percent of the vote if a similar pattern were repeated nationally. In a 2017 general election the two parties together scooped up more than four-fifths of the vote.\nWorse is likely to come for Britain\u2019s two big political parties. They must now gear up for elections to the European Parliament on May 23, when two new parties that did not run on Thursday will take part: the Brexit Party, which backs leaving the European Union quickly and without an agreement if necessary; and Change UK, which wants to remain in the bloc.\nThe Brexit Party, led by Nigel Farage, the former leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party, is being particularly closely watched \u2014 recent opinion polls suggest it is tied with Labour for the lead in those elections, or even ahead, and taking much of its support from former Conservative voters.\nBut as usual in Britain, politicians are drawing different conclusions from the latest Brexit-induced crisis. On Friday, Mrs. May argued that \u201cthere was a simple message from yesterday\u2019s elections to both us and the Labour Party: Just get on and deliver Brexit.\u201d\nBut some Conservative lawmakers saw the results as a verdict on Mrs. May and called on her to resign, or at least name a date for her departure.\nOn the Labour side, the shadow chancellor John McDonnell underscored confusion over his party\u2019s stance by writing on Twitter that the message from local elections had been, \u201cBrexit \u2014 sort it,\u201d adding, \u201cMessage received.\u201d\nBut when that was seen as a suggestion that an agreement on Brexit with Mrs. May was becoming more likely, Mr. McDonnell protested that he had been misinterpreted. \u201cI was simply making the point we need to get on with sorting this out whichever way,\u201d he wrote.", "date": "May 3, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/03/world/europe/uk-local-elections.html", "tags": "brexit may backlash parties seats main party local elections \u201d results labour \u2014 mrs. lose"}
