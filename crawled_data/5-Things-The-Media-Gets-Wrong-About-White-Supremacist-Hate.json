{"title": "5 Things The Media Gets Wrong About White Supremacist Hate", "content": "White supremacist terror is at the top of people\u2019s minds after a white supremacist stabbed and killed two men\u00a0who were defending two young black women, one in a hijab, from his bigoted rant in Portland, Oregon, last month.\nThe incident attracted widespread media coverage,\u00a0which in turn drew criticism from many people on Twitter who\u00a0denounced news outlets\u00a0for not labeling the attack as terrorism.\nThere\u2019s a familiar\u00a0double standard\u00a0in how the media treats\u00a0violence\u00a0by white supremacists versus violence\u00a0by Islamist extremists. It\u2019s time to get\u00a0it right.\nHuffPost spoke to two experts \u2015 Farai Chideya, a journalist who has been reporting on white nationalism for more than 25 years, and Heidi Beirich, the head of the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s Intelligence Project, who has been studying white extremist groups since 1999 \u2015 to discuss the problem of white supremacist hate today, and how the media can do a better job covering it.\nThis is what the media should know:\n\u201cThe one thing that bothers me the most about media coverage of these incidents is that they\u2019re not frequently enough put in the context of the fact we\u2019ve had ton of domestic terrorism recently,\u201d Beirich told HuffPost. \u00a0\nBeirich noted a recent spate of white supremacist attacks in the U.S. In addition to the May 26 Portland attack, there\u2019s the March 20 murder of 66-year-old Timothy Caughman, who was black, by a man who traveled to New York City expressly to kill African-American men, and\u00a0the May 22 killing of Richard Collins III, a black college student in Maryland, by a man who belonged to a white supremacist Facebook group.\n\u201cWhen it comes to Muslim terrorism, nobody questions it\u2019s a problem that\u2019s an ongoing threat \u2015 a security problem, radicalization problem, et cetera \u2015 which it is,\u201d Beirich said. \u201cBut when it comes to Portland or Dylann Roof\u00a0[the 2015 Charleston church shooter], they always seem to appear as one-offs.\u201d\u00a0\nOutlets covering last week\u2019s truck and knife attack in London, for instance \u2015 carried out by three men identified as Islamist extremists \u2015 often made a point of mentioning the bombing\u00a0in Manchester, England, two weeks before. \nBut many news outlets covering the stabbing attack in Portland\u00a0failed to mention other recent U.S. attacks by white supremacists, such as the one in Maryland just a few days earlier.\nMeanwhile, more domestic terrorism incidents in the U.S. have been carried out by people associated with white supremacist ideologies than by people with radical Islamist ideologies, Beirich noted. \nIn\u00a0tracking deadly terror attacks in the U.S., the New America Foundation has counted 11 attacks by Islamic extremists since 9/11, compared to 21 by far-right extremists. Between the 9/11 attacks and the 2016 Orlando, Florida, nightclub shooting, more people were killed in the U.S. by right-wing extremists than by Islamic extremists, the foundation said.\nAmericans \u201cshouldn\u2019t be surprised\u201d by the frequency of white supremacist attacks, since they are rooted in a long history of racial discrimination, Beirich said. As she puts it, until the Voting Rights Act of 1965, \u201cwhite supremacy was the law of the land.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m disturbed by this cycle [of attacks],\u201d Chideya told HuffPost. \u201cBut we began as a country that said \u2018all men are created equal\u2019 \u2015 but there was slavery, and women were not allowed to vote.\u201d \n\u201cThis is a continuation,\u201d she added. \u201cWe\u2019re not done, just because people are uneasy with how long the history is and how prevalent the issue is. We have to give up thinking this is rare.\u201d\nWhite supremacist hate doesn\u2019t just manifest as violent extremism, Chideya noted.\n\u201cPeople frame it as weird guys with fringe beliefs \u2015 no,\u201d Chideya said. \u201cWhite supremacists don\u2019t just wear hoods and give Nazi salutes. White nationalists are in the U.S. government.\u201d\nShe pointed to\u00a0\u201cinstitutionalized white nationalism, like voting laws,\u201d mentioning\u00a0North Carolina\u2019s voting practices an example of \u201cde facto white nationalism.\u201d The courts recently found that the state\u2019s legislative districts were drawn to intentionally disadvantage black voters.\u00a0\nChideya also mentioned \u201cpolitical white nationalism, like in the White House,\u201d\u00a0calling out the links between the white supremacist movement and upper echelons of the federal government. \nShe listed President Donald Trump\u2019s chief strategist Steve Bannon, who led Breitbart News, a publisher of white nationalist content, and Trump aide Sebastian Gorka, who reportedly has ties to a Nazi-aligned group. When Beirich spoke to HuffPost in April, she also pointed to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who has received awards from and has\u00a0spoken at events\u00a0for an organization that the Southern Poverty Law Center lists as\u00a0an anti-Muslim hate group.\nIn terms of how news media could do better, Chideya pointed to coverage of Greg Gianforte, who was elected to Congress in Montana last month and was found to have made donations to candidates with ties to white nationalist groups\u00a0\u2015\u00a0which Rewire reported just days before his election. Gianforte made national news when he physically attacked a reporter on the eve of the election.\nChideya\u00a0said members of the news media were slow to surface Gianforte\u2019s links to hate groups, which she thought should have \u201ccome out sooner.\u201d\n\u201cIn general, reporters need to become more adept at tracking not just extremist white nationalism, but also when it enters the mainstream, like in Montana,\u201d Chideya said. \u201cThe same way you run a background check on politicians\u2019\u00a0finances, run a check on if they are connected to extremist ideologies.\u201d\nNews outlets have\u00a0been repeatedly criticized for their\u00a0slowness to label attacks\u00a0by white perpetrators\u00a0as \u201cterrorism,\u201d while they\u2019re quick to use the label\u00a0when attackers are perceived as nonwhite or\u00a0\u201cother\u201d\u00a0\u2015 and\u00a0specifically, Muslim.\n\u201cWhat is terrorism? Acts designed to inspire terror. But somehow, we don\u2019t call this terrorism,\u201d\u00a0Chideya told HuffPost of the Portland attack. \u201cWhen a Muslim terrorist kills one, two, five people, it\u2019s immediately labeled terrorism. But when a white nationalist kills one, two, five people, it\u2019s not labeled terrorism. But they\u2019re the same.\u201d \u00a0\n\u201cWe have to be aware as journalists of the labels we use,\u201d she added.\nThe issue of how to label any given attack is complex. As CNN reports, for an attack to be labeled a hate crime, a perpetrator has to attack someone based on their identity \u2015 for example, their race, religion, sexual orientation or ethnicity. For an act to be labeled terrorism, the perpetrator has to be motivated by political or ideological beliefs. \nBut the line is blurry. Many people condemned the government for not labeling Dylann Roof a terrorist\u00a0after he killed\u00a0nine black people in a Charleston church in 2015 and specifically said he was there \u201cto shoot black people,\u201d according to witnesses.\nOfficials themselves can be slow to use the \u201cterrorist\u201d label when white attackers are involved, adding to the challenge for journalists.\n\u201cIt\u2019s too early to say whether last night\u2019s violence was an act of domestic terrorism or a federal hate crime,\u201d an FBI special agent told reporters the day after the Portland attack, per CNN.\nBeyond the inconsistent labeling, there are other discrepancies in how the media treats violent attacks by white supremacists versus by Islamist extremists.\nWhite attackers are often portrayed as lone wolves with mental health issues, while Islamist attackers are simply terrorists. The Muslim community is made to answer or apologize for Islamist extremism, while white Christians don\u2019t get similar requests. There\u2019s deep digging into\u00a0how Islamic extremists were radicalized \u2015 but that\u2019s not the case for white extremists.\n\u201cPlenty of terrorists have had mental health issues,\u201d Chideya told HuffPost. \u201cThere is\u00a0a more general presumption that white people are good and innocent in American culture at large\u00a0\u2015 and journalists come from that culture.\u201d\u00a0\nAnd when someone perceived as Muslim commits an attack, the\u00a0news typically receives far more coverage\u00a0than an attack by a white supremacist would.\u00a0\nThis double standard is perpetuated from\u00a0the nation\u2019s highest office, as Trump continues to\u00a0respond selectively\u00a0to terror attacks during\u00a0his presidency.\u00a0\nAfter Islamist extremists attacked London, for instance,\u00a0he\u00a0condemned the violence on Twitter\u00a0the same day. After the Portland attack,\u00a0Trump waited more than two days before tweeting about it.\n\u201cThere\u2019s crickets from Donald Trump when there\u2019s white nationalist violence,\u201d Chideya said. \u201cBut there\u2019s a deluge with Muslim violence.\u201d\nNews organizations are sometimes concerned about giving extremists too much attention, which could feed into their desire for publicity\u00a0and\u00a0spur copycats. \nBeirich recognizes the issue, but she maintains that reporters need to pay more attention \u2015 not less \u2015 to the issue of white supremacist hate.\n\u201cI know there are concerns about journalists who don\u2019t want to report on a neo-Nazi rally where four people show up, because those groups are just seeking attention \u2015 and that\u2019s a valid point,\u201d Beirich said. \u201cBut when we\u2019re talking about domestic terrorism and hate crimes related to white supremacy \u2015 that\u2019s a real thing.\u201d\n\u201cI understand not wanting to draw attention to small instances,\u201d she added, noting specifically the series of news stories about white supremacist flyers on college campuses.\u00a0\u201cBut when people are getting killed because of this, we\u2019ve got to pay attention.\u201d\nDeciding how much of a platform to provide extremists is an \u201cinevitable transaction of journalism,\u201d Chideya noted. \nShe\u00a0recalled a time years ago when she was conducting a phone interview with a woman in the white supremacist movement. At the end of the interview, Chideya asked: \u201cI\u2019m black \u2015 would you have granted me the interview if you\u2019d known that?\u201d\nThe woman responded: \u201cProbably not \u2015 but on the other hand, every time I talk to a reporter, people will read your article and come find me.\u201d \n\u201cYou can write a piece saying [white supremacists] are cowards, and there still will be people who come over to their side,\u201d Chideya told HuffPost. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t do journalism \u2015 you just do it as well as you can.\u201d\nGood reporting on white supremacist movements will recognize that there is a range of people within any movement.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a question of journalism: Not every story is about Derek Black,\u201d she said, referring to a man The Washington Post profiled after he left the so-called alt-right movement. \u201cNor about the worst violent person in the movement.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNot only do we have domestic terrorism inspired by racism, but also we have a hate crime problem \u2015 and the dimensions are not understood,\u201d Beirich said. \u00a0\nWhile we know there has been a recent rise in the number of hate groups and a spike in hate crimes after Trump\u2019s election, the U.S. still\u00a0doesn\u2019t do a good job of tracking hate crimes. \nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation, for instance, puts out a report of around 5,000 to 6,000 hate crimes each year. But when the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics did a large-scale study from 2007 to 2011, Beirich noted, it found the number of hate crimes closer to 260,000\u00a0per year.\n\u201cIf people were looking at these data points more, we would be talking about ways to combat this problem,\u201d Beirich said. \u201cThis leads to less public policy interest in domestic terrorism committed by white supremacists \u2015 and allows Trump to minimize these threats. We should not leave him off the hook.\u201d\nAfter Saturday\u2019s attack by Islamist extremists in London, British Prime Minister Theresa May called for a new strategy on terror.\u00a0Trump\u00a0called on the courts\u00a0to reinstate his travel ban on certain Muslim-majority countries \u2015 a move that was roundly criticized. \nBy contrast, after the Portland attack, Trump\u00a0made no calls to change policy to prevent future attacks.\n\u201cThe facts and the context have to be put out there by media,\u201d Beirich said. \u201cWe need policies to address this.\u201d\nAmerica does not do a good job of tracking incidents of hate and bias. We need your help to create a database of such incidents across the country, so we all know what\u2019s going on.
