{"title": "Could Monitoring Students on Social Media Stop the Next School Shooting?", "content": "Hours after the deadly school shooting in Parkland, Fla., companies that market their services to schools began to speak up. \u201cGovernor, take pride that a Vermont-based company is helping schools identify the violence before it happens,\u201d one company wrote on Twitter to Gov. Phil Scott of Vermont.\nThe chief executive of another company appeared on the news to boast of a \u201chome run\u201d: Its algorithms, he said, had helped prevent two student suicides.\nTo an anguished question that often follows school shootings \u2014 Why didn\u2019t anyone spot the warning signs? \u2014 these companies have answered with a business model: 24/7 monitoring of student activity on social media.\nOften without advance warning to students and parents, the companies flag posts like those of Auseel Yousefi, who was expelled in 2013 from his high school in Huntsville, Ala., for Twitter posts made on the last day of his junior year. \u201cA kid has a right to be who they want outside of school,\u201d he said later.\nMore than 100 public school districts and universities, faced with the prospect that the next attacker may be among their own students, have hired social media monitoring companies over the past five years, according to a review of school spending records. And each successive tragedy brings more customers: In the weeks after the Parkland attack, dozens of schools entered into such contracts, even though there is little evidence that the programs work as promised.\nThe customers have included districts reeling in the aftermath of shootings, like the Newtown Public Schools in Connecticut; some of the nation\u2019s largest urban school systems, like Los Angeles and Chicago; and prominent universities like Michigan State and Florida State. The monitoring is one of a host of products and services, including active shooter insurance and facial recognition technology, that are being marketed to schools amid questions about their value.\n\u201cIf it helps save one life, it\u2019s worth every dollar spent on it,\u201d said Chris Frydrych, the chief executive of Geo Listening, a California company whose website says, \u201cDon\u2019t miss out on the opportunity to listen.\u201d\nIn many cases the monitoring contracts have not worked out as planned. There is little evidence the companies have helped ferret out brewing threats of violence, bullying or self-harm, according to a review of contracts, marketing materials and emails obtained through public records requests.\nBut in hiring them, schools expand the traditional boundaries of their responsibility, and perhaps, experts say, their liability. And, the documents show, they vacuum up hundreds of harmless posts, raising questions about student privacy.\nOne of the posts by Mr. Yousefi, now 22, said he was going to \u201cchop\u201d a teacher \u201cin the throat,\u201d which he said was an inside joke among the class, the teacher included. He believes his posts were brought to the school\u2019s attention by a social media monitoring company seeking clients.\n\u201cIt takes authority and extends it to an inappropriate extent in a way that\u2019s truly terrifying,\u201d he said. Shortly afterward, the district hired a firm to monitor posts, and more than a dozen students were expelled.\nThe monitoring programs have often been initiated without notifying students, parents or local school boards. Because of their relatively low cost \u2014 contracts typically range from a few thousand dollars to $40,000 per year \u2014 the deals can get buried in school board agendas.\nIn their advertising, the companies promise much, but when contacted, they declined to give details on specific incidents, citing nondisclosure agreements and student privacy laws. Many schools also declined to give details of instances in which they used the companies\u2019 information.\nInterviews and marketing materials help paint a picture of the companies\u2019 basic approach. Some apply and pay for access to social media companies\u2019 public data, such as Twitter\u2019s so-called data fire hose, which gives users the ability to access and analyze public tweets in bulk.\nRather than asking schools for a list of students and social media handles, the companies typically employ a method called \u201cgeofencing\u201d to sweep up posts within a given geographic area and use keywords to narrow the pool. Because only a small fraction of social media users share their locations, the companies use additional clues, like a user\u2019s hometown, to determine whose content is worth flagging.\nSchool officials are alerted to flagged posts in real time or in batches at the end of each day. Burlington High School in Massachusetts typically receives two to six alerts per day from Social Sentinel, the company based in Vermont, according to a list of alerts from 2017. Many consisted of normal teenage banter.\n\u201cOk so all day I\u2019ve wanted my bio grade up online and now that it\u2019s up I\u2019ve decided I want to die,\u201d one Twitter post said.\n\u201cHangnails make me want to die,\u201d said another.\nBy its count, Social Sentinel has contracts in more than 30 states.\n\u201cWe\u2019re a carbon monoxide detector,\u201d said Gary Margolis, the company\u2019s chief executive and a former campus police chief. \u201cIf a student is posting about not liking their teacher, that\u2019s not what we pay attention to. If a student is posting about shooting their teacher, we would hope we\u2019d be able to find something like that.\u201d\nMark Pompano, the security director for the school district that includes Sandy Hook Elementary in Connecticut, has vetted hundreds of school safety products since the mass shooting there. In 2015, impressed by Social Sentinel\u2019s pitch, he gave the company a try for a few months, but it never caught anything serious, he said.\nSocial Sentinel struggled to weed out posts from the Twitter account of a nearby liquor store, records show.\n\u201cI cannot recall a single incident that we used Social Sentinel to pursue some type of security threat or anything like that,\u201d Mr. Pompano said. \u201cIf something doesn\u2019t work, we\u2019re not going to stick with it.\u201d\nToday, Mr. Pompano said, the district relies mostly on tips from students, a system that works well if there is an atmosphere of trust. \u201cIt goes back to human intelligence, where kids have at least one trusted adult,\u201d he said, \u201cknowing what they\u2019re telling them is confidential.\u201d\nIn a few cases, school administrators said, monitoring services have helped them identify students who appeared to be at risk of harming themselves. More rare were instances in which an imminent threat to others was thwarted. In 2015, as the first anniversary of a shooting at Florida State approached, a post expressing sympathy for the gunman and an intent to visit the campus was intercepted by Social Sentinel, the campus police chief said. The man was stopped on campus and warned to stay away. When he returned, he was arrested.\nPatrick Larkin, an assistant superintendent in Burlington, Mass., said he receives alerts on his phone in real time from Social Sentinel. \u201cNineteen out of 20\u201d come from people who are not even his students, he said earlier this year.\nReal threats, administrators said, are more often flagged by vigilant users, as was the case with the Parkland gunman, whose troubling comments on YouTube were reported to the F.B.I.\nMr. Larkin said Social Sentinel helps him sleep easier at night. And because it can track only public posts \u2014 nothing that requires a \u201cfriend\u201d request \u2014 he doesn\u2019t see it as an intrusion.\n\u201cMy concern was, what if it\u2019s some odd hour and some kid tweets something I don\u2019t see?\u201d he said.\nMr. Margolis said it is hard to demonstrate that harm has been averted. \u201cHow do you measure the absence of something?\u201d he said, adding that Social Sentinel\u2019s algorithms have improved in recent months.\nOne client, Michael Sander, the superintendent of Franklin City Schools in Ohio, said he had planned to contact the police about a Twitter message that read, \u201cThere\u2019s three seasons: summer, construction season and school shooting season.\u201d But the poster appeared to attend school in Franklin, Wis. \u2014 not Ohio.\nSome companies have backed off from early promises, including creating watch lists that tracked specific people. LifeRaft, based in Nova Scotia, told the Salem-Keizer Public Schools in Oregon that it could help the district find \u201cbehavioral information\u201d on \u201cindividuals of concern.\u201d The company also vowed to monitor the conversations of \u201cgroups and networks\u201d connected with those individuals.\nMary Jane Leslie, the vice president of LifeRaft, acknowledged that the language was \u201ccreepy,\u201d saying, \u201cTo be frank, I don\u2019t think the software ever really did that.\u201d\nShe added that the company no longer markets its services to schools.\nTo use social media data, monitoring companies must agree to specific rules, which were tightened after multiple companies were condemned by the American Civil Liberties Union in 2016 for helping police clients surveil activists in the Black Lives Matter movement. Twitter, Facebook and Instagram cut off the firms\u2019 data access. Some, like Social Sentinel, dropped their police contracts to concentrate on serving schools.\nThe A.C.L.U. called out Media Sonar, an Ontario firm that recommended that its police clients monitor hashtags like #BlackLivesMatter, #DontShoot and #ImUnarmed. In late 2015, around the one-year anniversary of the death of Michael Brown in an encounter with the police in Ferguson, Mo., Media Sonar briefly contracted with the Ferguson-Florissant School District, which asked for alerts on the terms \u201cprotest\u201d and \u201cwalkout.\u201d\nKevin Hampton, a spokesman for the district, said the service was used strictly for safety purposes. Media Sonar did not respond to interview requests.\nBut privacy advocates questioned whether safety was the companies\u2019 only motive. \u201cThe companies seem to dance back and forth\u201d between marketing themselves for public health and student discipline, said Kade Crockford, director of the A.C.L.U. of Massachusetts\u2019 Technology for Liberty program. \u201cThose two goals seem fairly at odds and somewhat contradictory.\u201d\nIn 2013, the Huntsville City Schools in Alabama enlisted a consulting firm for a surveillance program that led to the expulsion of 14 students, 12 of them African-American.\nCasey Wardynski, the district\u2019s former superintendent, told local news organizations that the program had helped break up a local gang, and some students were expelled for wielding guns on Facebook.\nOne student had been accused of \u201cholding too much money\u201d in photographs, an investigation by the Southern Poverty Law Center found, and one was suspended for an Instagram post in which she wore a sweatshirt with an airbrushed image of her father, a murder victim. School officials said the sweatshirt\u2019s colors and the student\u2019s hand symbol were evidence of gang ties, according to the investigation.\nMonitoring students\u2019 lives off campus is untested terrain. School lawyers are advising administrators to be \u201cvery cautious,\u201d said Sonja Trainor, the managing director of legal advocacy for the National School Boards Association. Districts \u201ctend to find that they\u2019re inundated with information, and it becomes very difficult to establish parameters for issuing warnings to the community,\u201d she said.\nIn 2013, the Glendale Unified School District in California hired the company Geo Listening in response to student suicides in which online bullying had been cited as a factor.\nLilly Leif, a 2017 graduate of Glendale\u2019s Crescenta Valley High School, said she was summoned to the assistant principal\u2019s office after using an expletive in a post about her biology class. The assistant principal showed her a printed copy and asked her to change her account settings to private, she said.\n\u201cShe said it reflected poorly on my high school and my teacher,\u201d said Ms. Leif, 19, now a college sophomore.\nIn another instance, Ms. Leif said, an administrator asked students to delete a message promoting a school fund-raiser at \u201cBlaze Pizza\u201d and \u201cBaked Bear\u201d \u2014 actual pizza and ice cream establishments \u2014 because of the apparent allusions to marijuana.\nRene Valdes, the district\u2019s former director of student support services, said the program included teaching students online etiquette. \u201cThe conversation with the kid would be, \u2018Realize that companies are now monitoring social media before they hire people,\u2019\u201d Mr. Valdes said.\nAfter an outcry in Glendale, the State Legislature passed a 2014 law requiring California schools to notify students and parents if they are even considering a monitoring program. The law also lets students see any information collected about them and tells schools to destroy all data on students once they turn 18 or leave the district.\nThat\u2019s no longer a concern for Glendale, which dropped its contract with Geo Listening last year.\n\u201cWe discovered more and more kids were using Instagram and Snapchat, and those were not being monitored by Geo Listening,\u201d Mr. Valdes said. \u201cIt seems like the kids are always two steps ahead of the adults.\u201d", "date": "Sept. 6, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/06/us/social-media-monitoring-school-shootings.html", "tags": "next shooting company media companies social monitoring school \u201d schools stop student could students"}
