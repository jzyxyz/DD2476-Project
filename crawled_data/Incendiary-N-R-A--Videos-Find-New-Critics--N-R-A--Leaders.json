{"title": "Incendiary N.R.A. Videos Find New Critics: N.R.A. Leaders", "content": "The flash point was Thomas the Tank Engine.\nLast September, the National Rifle Association\u2019s famously combative spokeswoman, Dana Loesch, provoked widespread outrage when she took to the gun group\u2019s streaming service to mock ethnic diversity on the popular children\u2019s program \u201cThomas & Friends,\u201d portraying the show\u2019s talking trains in Ku Klux Klan hoods. Now, growing unease over the site\u2019s inflammatory rhetoric, and whether it has strayed too far from the N.R.A.\u2019s core gun-rights mission, has put its future in doubt.\nThe site, NRATV, is a central part of the organization\u2019s messaging apparatus. Since its creation in 2016, it has adopted an increasingly apocalyptic, hard-right tone, warning of race wars, describing Barack Obama as a \u201cfresh-faced flower-child president,\u201d calling for a march on the Federal Bureau of Investigation and comparing journalists to rodents.\nIn recent weeks, in a rare airing of internal debate at the N.R.A., two prominent board members expressed concerns about NRATV to The New York Times. Their statements were released through the N.R.A. itself, amid what was described as an internal review of NRATV and its future.\n\u201cSince the founding of NRATV, some, including myself and other board members, have questioned the value of it,\u201d Marion Hammer, the group\u2019s most formidable lobbyist and a key adviser to its chief executive, Wayne LaPierre, said in a statement. \u201cWayne has told me and others that NRATV is being constantly evaluated \u2014 to make sure it works in the best interest of the organization and provides an appropriate return on investment.\u201d\nThe reassessment underscores a debate within the N.R.A. over how broad its activism should be. And it comes as the organization faces a storm of challenges, including a series of mass shootings that has created a new generation of gun-control activists.\nCongressional investigations into the N.R.A.\u2019s possible Russia ties were energized after Maria Butina, a suspected Russian agent, pleaded guilty in December to using the N.R.A. in a political influence operation. And the organization, incorporated in New York, may have a potent foe in Letitia James, the state\u2019s recently elected attorney general, who has vowed to investigate the N.R.A.\u2019s tax-exempt status.\nAs falling membership dues put the N.R.A. under further strain, board members have also expressed concern about the size of payments to the ad firm that produces NRATV, Ackerman McQueen. The firm and its affiliates pocketed $40 million from the N.R.A. in 2017; billings directly to Ackerman have increased nearly 50 percent since 2015. One prominent host, Dan Bongino, left amid cutbacks at NRATV, but he said the site had tried to retain him.\nAckerman, a partner to the gun group  since the \u201cI\u2019m the N.R.A.\u201d campaign of the 1980s, runs the NRATV Twitter account, has done polling work for the organization and revamped its gun safety program for children. It has also been credited with a slick makeover of Mr. LaPierre \u2014 who, in the words of one former N.R.A. lobbyist, previously resembled an \u201cintroverted chess champion.\u201d\nMr. LaPierre\u2019s wife, Susan, has worked for an Ackerman subsidiary, and there has come to be a revolving door between the two companies, with many employees having worked by turns for both NRATV and Ackerman.\nOliver L. North, the N.R.A. president, has a contract with Ackerman, though the N.R.A. would not disclose its size. As part of the relationship, Mr. North, a former Fox News pundit, hosts media programming and special events, like the show \u201cAmerican Heroes,\u201d which recently began airing on NRATV.\nThe N.R.A., a nonprofit, has also directed $18 million since 2010 to a private company jointly owned by executives of Ackerman and the N.R.A., according to records and interviews.\n\u201cIt is clear to me that NRATV is an experiment and Wayne is evaluating the future of the enterprise,\u201d Willes K. Lee, a board member who leads the N.R.A. Outreach Committee, said in a statement to The Times.\nAfter the Thomas the Tank Engine video, he said, Mr. LaPierre appeared \u201clivid and embarrassed\u201d in a meeting with the outreach group. \u201cHe apologized to the entire committee and spent hours listening to our concerns.\u201d\nMs. Loesch has emerged as NRATV\u2019s most visible host, deriding gun-control advocates as \u201ctragedy-dry-humping whores\u201d and vowing to combat the left with what she called the \u201cclenched fist of truth\u201d \u2014 a body part that the comedian John Oliver said was located \u201ca little past the bent elbow of nonsense.\u201d In one video, she warned The Times, \u201cWe\u2019re coming for you\u201d; in another, she threatened to burn a copy of the newspaper.\nChuck Holton, an NRATV correspondent, attributed terrorist activity in Europe to \u201cthe broader problem of multiculturalism and socialism\u201d and to \u201cgender-bending.\u201d He also claimed that left-wing groups, the billionaire George Soros and the Venezuelan government were trying \u201cto influence the 2018 midterms by sending Honduran migrants north in the thousands.\u201d\nGrant Stinchfield, a host, claimed that \u201call radicalized terrorists are Muslims,\u201d overlooking mass shooters like Dylann Roof, who killed nine black churchgoers in Charleston, S.C., in 2015.\nSuch far-ranging commentary has raised questions among some N.R.A. members about the scope of the organization\u2019s messaging.\n\u201cThe N.R.A. shouldn\u2019t be putting this out,\u201d said Jeff Knox, an N.R.A. member who runs the Firearms Coalition, a smaller advocacy organization. \u201cIt\u2019s not gun rights; it\u2019s red meat for the hard right.\u201d\nMr. Knox\u2019s father, Neal, was an N.R.A. board member who played a leading role in an effort to fire Ackerman in the 1990s amid discontent over its growing influence. A faction loyal to Mr. LaPierre ultimately prevailed, leading to a purge of the board and allowing the two organizations to become more deeply intertwined.\n\u201cWhy are we getting so involved in left-right politics instead of sticking close to our issue, the Second Amendment?\u201d the younger Mr. Knox asked.\nAckerman declined to comment, but in a recent interview in The Oklahoman, Revan McQueen, the firm\u2019s chief executive, said his company\u2019s approach was evolving from pure advertising to a \u201cphilosophy of branded news.\u201d As Ackerman\u2019s website puts it, \u201cEvery brand must be its own media company.\u201d\nTo that end, the firm has created video networks for the Chickasaw Nation and the Integris health care system of Oklahoma, though their content is relatively benign. A recent episode of ChickasawTV, for example, featured a visit to an art gallery. Over on NRATV, a host was calling liberalism \u201ca mental disorder.\u201d\nBeyond NRATV, the N.R.A. backed Ackerman\u2019s performance.\n\u201cWhen Ackerman McQueen began working with the N.R.A., the association was little more than a fledgling grass-roots operation,\u201d Andrew Arulanandam, an N.R.A. spokesman, said in a statement.\n\u201cThe N.R.A. is now the most effective advocacy organization of its kind,\u201d he said, adding that the firm had created \u201ca national platform for the N.R.A.\u201d and that it was \u201can important partner.\u201d\nDuring the N.R.A. power struggle in the 1990s, a board member filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission, claiming that an N.R.A. contract with an Ackerman subsidiary \u201cwas done without any \u2018request for proposals\u2019; any bidding process; and no competitive bidding.\u201d\nThe commission decided in a 6-0 vote not to take action, but criticisms have persisted.\n\u201cThe N.R.A. is willing to play fast and loose with tax regulations,\u201d said Marcus S. Owens, a partner at Loeb & Loeb who served for a decade as director of the Exempt Organizations Division of the Internal Revenue Service.\nMs. James, the New York attorney general, presents a new threat. Last year, she told Ebony magazine that the N.R.A. held itself \u201cout as a charitable organization\u201d but was actually \u201ca terrorist organization.\u201d\nWilliam A. Brewer III, the N.R.A.\u2019s outside counsel, said Ms. James had given no indication when she was a candidate that \u201cthe N.R.A. had done anything improper,\u201d adding that she had instead promised \u201ca taxpayer-funded fishing expedition.\u201d\nA number of  transactions could draw scrutiny. Since 2010, the N.R.A. has paid $18 million to a company that produces \u201cUnder Wild Skies,\u201d a hunting show on NRATV. Tyler Schropp, the N.R.A.\u2019s advancement director, came to the organization in 2010 from Ackerman, and had a stake in the production company until at least 2017, but \u201cno longer holds any interest,\u201d Mr. Brewer said.\nFederal rules restrict transactions that confer economic benefits on key executives of tax-exempt organizations.\nMr. Brewer described Mr. Schropp\u2019s stake as \u201ca minuscule interest\u201d that the N.R.A. found not to be objectionable. Payments related to \u201cUnder Wild Skies\u201d emerged only recently in N.R.A. tax filings.\nOther issues unrelated to Ackerman could also surface. The N.R.A. has transferred more than $100 million since 2012 from an affiliated charity that also lent the N.R.A. $5 million in 2017. Donations to the charity, the N.R.A. Foundation, are tax-deductible, while those to the N.R.A. are not.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re doing a program that\u2019s charitable, you run it through the charity,\u201d said David G. Samuels, a partner at Duval & Stachenfeld who served in the charities bureau of the New York Attorney General\u2019s Office, which oversees tax-exempt organizations. Such practices raise \u201cred flags,\u201d he said.\nLike some nonprofits, the N.R.A. has been lucrative for its top executives. Mr. LaPierre\u2019s compensation rose from less than $200,000 in the mid-1990s to nearly $1.5 million in 2017. It spiked to more than $5 million in 2015, largely because of a retirement plan payout.\nA review of public records found that the N.R.A., which has about 550 employees, has disclosed that 41 employees, contractors, vendors or consultants have relevant family relationships to others connected to the organization, including a \u201cniece-in-law\u201d of Mr. LaPierre who was hired as a consultant.\n\u201cThe N.R.A. strives to comply with all applicable regulations,\u201d Mr. Brewer said, adding that the organization has a \u201cconflict-of interest-policy\u201d and that \u201cvendor agreements are reviewed and approved\u201d by the board\u2019s audit committee when appropriate.\nWith New York regulators circling, it\u2019s no surprise that the state\u2019s politicians have become fodder for NRATV \u2014 particularly the governor, Andrew M. Cuomo, whose administration is already engaged in a legal fight with the gun group. Recently, the site even targeted Albany, describing it as \u201cGraft City.\u201d\nWhatever happens to NRATV, few expect the N.R.A. to become much less combative. Mr. LaPierre, in a speech this month, described the organization\u2019s approach as \u201cfull-contact advocacy,\u201d adding, \u201cWe are going to fight back against anyone who attempts to silence us.\u201d", "date": "March 11, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/11/us/nra-video-streaming-nratv.html", "tags": "incendiary leaders find videos ackerman nratv n.r.a \u201d organization n.r.a. board critics new"}
