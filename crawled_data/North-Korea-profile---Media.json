{"title": "North Korea profile - Media", "content": "Radio and TV sets in North Korea are pre-tuned to government stations that pump out a steady stream of propaganda. \nThe press and broadcasters - all of them under direct state control - serve up a menu of flattering reports about North Korea's leader. Economic hardship and famines are not reported. North Korea is one of the hardest countries for foreign media to cover. \nOrdinary North Koreans caught listening to foreign broadcasts risk harsh punishments, such as forced labour. The authorities attempt to jam foreign-based and dissident radio stations.\nA glimmer of hope, says watchdog Reporters Without Borders, is the \"communications black market\" on the North Korean-Chinese border where recordings of South Korean TV soaps and films are said to circulate. \nNorth Korea has a minimal internet presence. News agency KCNA and the party newspaper Rodong Sinmun are among a handful of official sites. Their output is aimed largely at audiences outside North Korea.\nUriminzikkiri, a site hosted in China, carries news from official North Korean sources. It operates accounts on Twitter, YouTube and Flickr.\nOnline access within North Korea is exceedingly rare and limited to sites that comprise the domestic intranet, says OpenNet Initiative. Content is chosen, and user activity monitored, by the authorities.    \nNorth Korea is one of RSF's \"Enemies of the Internet\". North Korean journalists are active on blog sites hosted in Japan and South Korea, the organisation says. \nA South Korean newspaper has said the North is believed to employ up to 1,000 hackers targeting other nations. \nThere is a 3G mobile phone service - a joint venture with an Egyptian firm. Take-up has proved popular among wealthier citizens in Pyongyang. \nIn 2013, officials loosened some curbs by allowing visitors to bring their mobile phones into North Korea. But mobile phone calls between foreigners and locals are prohibited.   \nRodong Sinmun (Labour Daily) - organ of Korean Workers' Party; web pages in English \nJoson Inmingun (Korean People's Army Daily) \nMinju Choson (Democratic Korea) - government organ \nRodongja Sinmum (Workers' Newspaper) - organ of trade union federation \nKorean Central Broadcasting Station - radio station of Korean Workers' Party \nKorean Central TV - TV station of Korean Workers' Party \nMansudae TV - cultural station \nVoice of Korea - state-run external service, via shortwave radio; web pages in several languages \nKorean Central News Agency (KCNA) - state-run; web pages in several languages\nUriminzokkiri (On Our Own) - website carrying official news; pages in several languages", "date": "24 August 2017", "href": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-15259016", "tags": "tv korean media news profile party workers radio north pages station korea"}
