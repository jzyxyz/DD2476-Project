{"title": "Rep- Liz Cheney Goes On \u2018Hooey\u2019 Rant About The Green New Deal", "content": "Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the third-ranking House Republican, falsely claimed Tuesday that the Green New Deal seeks to \u201coutlaw\u201d airplanes, cars, gasoline and \u201cprobably the entire U.S. military.\u201d\nCheney\u2019s comments, which came during a congressional hearing on climate change, parroted a tweet that\u00a0President Donald Trump\u00a0posted last week. She said constituents in Wyoming are particularly concerned that the Green New Deal, a sweeping resolution aimed as decarbonizing the U.S. economy to prevent catastrophic climate change, would mean no more air travel. \n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be crucially important for us to recognize and understand when we outlaw plane travel, we outlaw gasoline, we outlaw cars \u2015 I think, actually, probably the entire U.S. military \u2015 because of the Green New Deal, that we are able to explain to our constituents and to people all across this country what that really means,\u201d Cheney said. \nCheney referred to a \u201cfrequently asked questions\u201d document that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s (D-N.Y.) office circulated but, as The Washington Post reported,\u00a0that version didn\u2019t accurately portray what was in the resolution. That FAQ, one of at least two versions that went out, called for building \u201chigh-speed rail at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary.\u201d \n\u201cThat means that the government is going to be telling people where they can fly to and where they can\u2019t,\u201d Cheney said. \u201cAnd I would assume \u2015 I guess that means our colleagues from California are going to be riding their bicycles back home to their constituents.\u201d \nTo be clear, the Green New Deal says nothing about eliminating airplanes, cars or the military. Instead, the non-binding resolution \u2015 introduced last week by Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) \u2015 outlines lofty goals of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, building climate-resilient infrastructure and reversing income inequality by creating high-wage green jobs.\nRep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), one of nearly 80 co-sponsors of the resolution, said Cheney\u2019s line of questioning was \u201cbased on absolute hooey\u201d and that no supporter wants to ban air travel.\n\u201cThat\u2019s absolutely crazy,\u201d Huffman said. \u201cNone of us want to do that.\u201d\n\u201cThere comes a point where this type of questioning is so disingenuous and so completely disconnected from anything factual that there ought to be a mechanism to strike it from the record,\u201d Huffman added. (Cheney walked out of the hearing during Huffman\u2019s response.)\nHuffman noted that the unofficial FAQ was later removed. In a post to Twitter over the weekend, Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s chief of staff Saikat Chakrabarti wrote that \u201can early draft of a FAQ that was clearly unfinished and that doesn\u2019t represent the GND resolution got published to the website by mistake.\u201d\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped conservatives from using the document as fodder. \nHouse Republicans launched an assault on the Green New Deal during a pair of congressional hearings on climate last week, dismissing it as a \u201ctop-down\u201d and \u201cimpossible\u201d proposal. Like Cheney, Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) took to misrepresenting the plan, stoking fears that it would mean shuttering military bases around the globe and cutting military spending by 50 percent \u2015 proposals floated\u00a0by former Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein back in 2016, but not by any co-sponsor of the resolution.\nThe attacks have only continued. On the Senate floor Tuesday, Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) dubbed the Green New Deal a \u201csocialist fairy tale.\u201d At Tuesday\u2019s hearing of the subcommittee of the House Natural Resources Committee, Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) also called it \u201csocialist fairy tale\u201d and said Democrats are trying to \u201creplace six-figure energy jobs with bioenergetic hemp farms and wind-powered coffee shops.\u201d\nCheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, also took an opportunity Tuesday to go to bat for the fossil fuel industry \u2015 a top donor of her congressional campaigns. Residents of Wyoming \u2015 the largest coal-producing state in the country \u2015 are concerned about the impact a Green New Deal would have on local economy and the energy sector as a whole, she said.\n\u201cThe reliability is something that simply cannot be replaced,\u201d Cheney said of coal. \u201cIt\u2019s a national security issue, in addition to an economic issue.\u201d\nBut so is the climate crisis. In a dire report late last year, the United Nations\u2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned that warming beyond 2.3 degrees Fahrenheit above pre-industrial levels would result in $54 trillion in damages. And the Pentagon released an alarming report last month detailing how dozens of U.S. military bases are already threatened by rising seas, drought and wildfire.", "date": "\n02/12/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/liz-cheney-green-new-deal_n_5c63469ee4b03de942968b77", "tags": "goes resolution \u2018 hooey new \u201d \u2015 rant liz rep- cheney deal green rep."}
