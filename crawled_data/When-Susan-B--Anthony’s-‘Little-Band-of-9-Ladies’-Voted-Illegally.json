{"title": "When Susan B. Anthony\u2019s \u2018Little Band of 9 Ladies\u2019 Voted Illegally", "content": "On Nov. 5, 1872, nearly 50 years before the 19th Amendment granted women in the United States the right to vote, Susan B. Anthony and a small group of women cast their ballots for president in Rochester, N.Y., days after she had persuaded election inspectors to register them.\nThe move, which resulted in arrests and a trial \u2014 in which Anthony was found guilty \u2014 was an act of defiance and audacity that helped propel the long, slow march to women\u2019s suffrage.\nThe New York Times covered the moment, sort of. One paragraph ran inside the paper the next morning, Nov. 6. The news was deemed insignificant in no uncertain terms \u2014 it was published under the heading \u201cMinor Topics.\u201d\nThe item recognized that the event could lead to a momentous shift, acknowledging that Anthony was \u201cleading to the polls the advance guard of the coming squadrons of female voters.\u201d At the same time, it captured the dismissive misogyny of the era, referring to the women as \u201ca little band of nine ladies.\u201d\nThe tone might seem shocking today, but it shouldn\u2019t, said Louise Bernikow, an expert on American women\u2019s history and a speaker on women\u2019s political movements.\nNewspapers at the time paid little attention to the push for women\u2019s suffrage. \u201cIt was not a massively popular movement in 1872,\u201d she said.\nThis brief item in The Times was only one example of how the paper reported on the efforts. An article published a decade later, on Oct. 16, 1882, was written in terms that would be deemed unquestionably sexist today.\n\u201cLiteral people may ask, Why, then, does not woman have the right of suffrage?\u201d it stated. \u201cThe answer is easy. She does not want it. Of course, it must be admitted that women, or some women, think they want the ballot. But they do not really want it.\u201d\nIt continued: \u201cPhilosophers have observed that the female desire is invariably kindled by that which is, or seems to be, unattainable.\u201d\nThe article \u2014 which examined a debate between Anthony and Edward Rosewater, a Republican politician and newspaper editor from Omaha \u2014 shot down Anthony\u2019s assertion that disenfranchisement was akin to degradation. To be \u201cdisfranchised,\u201d it stated, one would have to be robbed of a right \u201che (or she) already holds.\u201d\nIt then reinforced a central argument made by those who opposed women\u2019s suffrage: that it would lead to the destruction of the traditional home. \u201cTo give woman the ballot, provided woman wanted it, would be to bring desolation and distraction into multitudes of happy homes.\u201d\nMs. Bernikow, whose current work focuses on the effort to achieve women\u2019s suffrage in New York City, said The Times and its editors were \u201cspeaking to the status quo.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re entrenched white men,\u201d she said. \u201cThe main boogeyman that they\u2019ve come up with is home life.\u201d\nIt took another generation for the movement to gain a wider audience, Ms. Bernikow said. Harriot Stanton Blatch, a daughter of the women\u2019s rights pioneer Elizabeth Cady Stanton, broadened the movement from its initial focus on morality \u2014 that it was immoral to believe that women were not citizens.\nBlatch\u2019s method: Appeal to the court of public opinion by holding open-air meetings, speaking from soapboxes on street corners, and holding parades and marches with banners and pins.\nThis next iteration of the movement also benefited from a vast network of suffrage-focused media. \u201cThey had magazines, ways of distributing information that didn\u2019t depend of the mainstream press, tons of it,\u201d Ms. Bernikow said. \u201cThat made a huge difference.\u201d\nThe earlier revolutionaries were meeting in churches and petitioning the state and federal governments, but not enough citizens were paying attention. Anthony\u2019s 1872 vote and the subsequent trial had a very small audience.\n\u201cUntil the turn of the 20th century, that\u2019s the kind of movement it was,\u201d Ms. Bernikow said. \u201cYou were basically speaking to the converted.\u201d\nWomen\u2019s activists in the early 1900s also gained support by appealing to working women who were persuaded that having the vote would improve conditions. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge number, particularly in New York City \u2014 the garment workers,\u201d Ms. Bernikow said.\nAnd marchers took to the streets, \u201cextremely organized in military ranks,\u201d Ms. Bernikow said, disproving stereotypes that were common about women at the time \u2014 that they couldn\u2019t be organized and had no discipline.\n\u201cBy the turn of the century, you had, in New York City, 30,000 marchers and half a million onlookers,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible.\u201d", "date": "Nov. 5, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/us/womens-rights-suffrage-susan-b-anthony.html", "tags": "band movement \u2018 little bernikow ladies b. \u201d suffrage susan illegally women ms. \u2014 anthony voted"}
