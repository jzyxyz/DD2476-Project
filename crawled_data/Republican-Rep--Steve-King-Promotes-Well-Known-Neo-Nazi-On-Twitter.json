{"title": "Republican Rep- Steve King Promotes Well-Known Neo-Nazi On Twitter", "content": "Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa)\u00a0retweeted a British neo-Nazi on Tuesday,\u00a0the latest in a series of incidents in which the congressman has parroted or promoted the views of unabashed white supremacists and other bigots.\u00a0\n\u201cEurope is waking up... Will America... in time?\u201d King tweeted, linking to an anti-immigrant tweet from political activist Mark Collett.\u00a0\nCollett is one of Britain\u2019s most high-profile white supremacists.\u00a0He has expressed admiration for Adolf Hitler and has called himself a \u201cNazi sympathizer.\u201d\u00a0\nKing\u2019s office did not respond to multiple requests for comment Tuesday as to whether he condones the views of neo-Nazis, whether he\u2019s concerned his views align with those of neo-Nazis or whether a U.S. congressman should be amplifying a neo-Nazi on Twitter.\u00a0\nKing\u2019s office also did not respond when asked if the congressman considers himself a white nationalist.\nThe tweet, posted early Tuesday morning, hasn\u2019t been deleted.\u00a0\n\u201cNo mainstream politician in their right mind should be retweeting Mark Collett,\u201d said Nick Ryan, director of communications at the British-based anti-racism advocacy group Hope Not Hate.\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s a neo-Nazi who used to be the youth leader of the thuggish far-right British National Party here in the U.K., which has had ties to Holocaust denial, rampant anti-Semitism, helped spawn one of Europe\u2019s most infamous neo-Nazi gangs, Combat 18, and which once included among its number David Copeland, a bomber who targeted London\u2019s minority communities with a series of nail bombs in 1999, killing three, including a pregnant woman, and wounding scores of others,\u201d\u00a0Ryan said.\u00a0\nCollett was the subject of a 2002 Channel 4 documentary in the United Kingdom called \u201cYoung, Nazi and Proud,\u201d in which he states that AIDS is a \u201cfriendly disease because blacks, drug users and gays have it.\u201d\n\u201cThe Jews have been thrown out of every country, including England,\u201d he says in the documentary. \u201cLet\u2019s face it, when it happens that many times it\u2019s not just persecution: there\u2019s no smoke without fire.\u201d\nMore recently, as documented on the blog Angry White Men, Collett has been a frequent guest on white nationalist or \u201calt-right\u201d podcasts.\u00a0Just last month, he co-hosted an episode of \u201cThis Week on the Alt-Right.\u201d The episode\u2019s \u201cspecial guest\u201d was American white supremacist and former KKK leader David Duke, whom Collett praised.\u00a0\n\u201cIf he has any sense, Steve King should rapidly hit the undo button [on Twitter],\u201d Ryan, the Hope Not Hate spokesperson, said of King\u2019s tweet Tuesday.\u00a0\nBut King has a long history of making racist statements and signaling his support for white nationalism.\u00a0\nHuffPost first asked King whether he considers himself a white nationalist back in December, after he tweeted \u201cDiversity is not our strength,\u201d a phrase used for years by prominent racists and anti-Semites like David Duke. He didn\u2019t respond then either.\u00a0\nKing has said America should not apologize for slavery,\u00a0has suggested that the country\u2019s first black president was born in Kenya and has argued that most undocumented immigrants are \u201cdrug mules.\u201d\n\u201cFor every [undocumented immigrant] who\u2019s a valedictorian, there\u2019s another 100 out there who weigh 130 pounds \u2014 and they\u2019ve got calves the size of cantaloupes because they\u2019re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert,\u201d he said.\u00a0", "date": "\n06/12/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/steve-king-white-nationalist-neo-nazi-retweet_n_5b200eaee4b0adfb826e8e40", "tags": "congressman steve well-known promotes twitter neo-nazi \u201d white whether republican king rep- tuesday collett"}
