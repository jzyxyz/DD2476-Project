{"title": "Donald Trump Freaks Out Again Over George Conway, 'Husband From Hell'", "content": "President Donald Trump appears determined to have the last word in his ongoing Twitter beef with George Conway, the husband of White House counselor Kellyanne Conway.\nBut Conway, a lawyer who contends the president is mentally unstable and incompetent, doesn\u2019t seem prepared to let the feud die anytime soon.\nTrump on Wednesday morning launched a blistering attack on Conway for a second straight day. He called him \u201ca stone cold LOSER\u201d and a \u201chusband from hell\u201d who was \u201cVERY jealous\u201d of his wife\u2019s success:\nTrump also said he \u201cbarely\u201d knew Conway, a claim that has been contradicted\u00a0by CNN analyst Ryan Lizza, who pointed out that Conway actually introduced Trump to Kellyanne Conway.\nConway fired back just 19 minutes later.\nTrump seemed \u201cdetermined to prove\u201d Conway\u2019s claim that he has a narcissistic personality disorder, he wrote.\nConway followed up with these additional posts:\nConway has frequently criticized Trump in recent months, despite his wife\u2019s lofty White House position.\nHe\u2019s given Trump a mocking degree \u201chonor,\u201d\u00a0trollingly rewritten the presidential oath and repeatedly questioned Trump\u2019s mental health.\nTrump responded Tuesday, using his favorite social media platform to call Conway a \u201ctotal loser.\u201d He also shared his 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale\u2019s earlier attack on Conway.\nConway, meanwhile, told\u00a0The Washington Post\u00a0that his anti-Trump tweets were his way of getting the frustrations about the White House \u201coff my chest\u201d so he can\u00a0\u201cmove on with my life that day.\u201d\nIt\u2019s also \u201cso I don\u2019t end up screaming at\u201d his wife about it,\u201d he added.\nPolitical commentators have made much of the dynamic between George and Kellyanne Conway, given their decidedly anti- and pro-Trump stances. Joe Scarborough, host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d on Tuesday speculated that George Conway was channeling his wife\u2019s true feelings with his tweets.\nKellyanne Conway, asked Monday about her husband\u2019s claim of Trump\u2019s mental instability, said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t share those concerns.\u201d\u00a0", "date": "\n03/20/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-george-conway-husband-from-hell_n_5c922affe4b0f7ed945e29c6", "tags": "husband conway \u201c george hell trump kellyanne white donald house freaks wife"}
