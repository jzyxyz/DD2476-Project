{"title": "President Trump Talked Tough. But His Strike on Syria Was Restrained.", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 In sending missiles and bombs at Syria, President Trump hit more targets and used more firepower than he did in a similar military strike last year. But in the end, he opted for what was still a restrained operation that was evidently calculated to avoid provoking Syria\u2019s patrons in Russia and Iran into retaliating.\nThe United States and its European allies chose three targets instead of the single air base hit last year and used twice as many weapons. Still, American officials said the attack was intended as a proportional strike aimed specifically at Syria\u2019s chemical weapons facilities rather than a broader set of targets and was a one-time, one-night assault to punish Damascus for a suspected gas attack last weekend.\nIn the days before the strike, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis cautioned against a quick assault without a more thought-through strategy. He expressed concern about the potential for escalating the conflict by drawing Russia and Iran into a deeper confrontation with the United States in a country where all three have forces on the ground. With Russian and Iranian forces supporting the government of President Bashar al-Assad, the potential for miscues weighed on military planners.\nFor all of Mr. Trump\u2019s tough language this week, the variant he chose made no apparent effort to damage Mr. Assad\u2019s broader war machine or his government\u2019s command and control of its forces beyond its chemical weapons. The one-night burst of ordnance appears unlikely to change the overall balance of forces in Syria seven years into its bloody civil war. But the president hoped it would be enough to deter Mr. Assad from using chemical weapons again without being so damaging as to compel Russia and Iran to intervene.\nMr. Mattis told reporters at the Pentagon on Friday night that the strike was devised to minimize the chances of accidentally killing Russian soldiers and limit the damage to facilities directly associated with Syria\u2019s chemical weapons arsenal. While he called it a \u201cheavy strike,\u201d he said, \u201cRight now this is a one-time shot and I believe it has sent a very strong message to dissuade him, to deter him from doing it again.\u201d\nAnalysts said the limited nature of the strike probably would not compel Russia or Iran into taking significant action.\n\u201cThe Russian and Iranian responses will likely be shrill rhetorically, but direct responses are unlikely,\u201d said Dennis Ross, a longtime Middle East expert who has worked for several presidents and is now at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \u201cThe targets struck were tied to C.W. infrastructure,\u201d he added, meaning chemical weapons, \u201cand not the bases where the Russians and Iranians are.\u201d\nMr. Ross said it was possible that Iran could respond indirectly by using Shia militias against American forces in Iraq or possibly Syria but even that he said was \u201cless likely because of the limited nature of this attack.\u201d\nIn the hours and days leading up to the strike, the potential consequences consumed officials meeting at the Pentagon, in the White House Situation Room and at Fort Meade, Md., where United States Cyber Command is situated.\nAmerican officials doubted that Russia or Iran would counterattack directly against United States forces in the region. But they focused on the prospect of an asymmetric retaliation that would rely on Moscow and Tehran\u2019s formidable cyberabilities \u2014 one that would be harder for Washington to prepare for, or defend against.\nThere was no immediate intelligence that such an attack was being planned. It was also uncertain how much either Russia or Iran would take the risk of widening the crisis in Syria with a cybercounterattack on the West.\nBut American officials said they were girding to respond to a range of possible acts of retaliation \u2014 including an online strike that could block communications to United States troops in combat zones.\nThe heated language in the days before the strike focused as much, if not more, on Russia than on Syria, underscoring the dangers of a spiral into a more dangerous confrontation between the two former Cold War adversaries.\nHours before the strikes began, Nikki R. Haley, the American ambassador to the United Nations, engaged in a scathing exchange with her Russian counterpart at a Friday meeting of the Security Council.\nThe Russian ambassador, Vasily A. Nebenzya, accused the United States and its allies of reckless warmongering. Mr. Nebenzya said that there was no confirmed evidence that chemical weapons had been used in Douma and that the United States and its allies had \u201cdemonstrated they have no interest in an investigation.\u201d\nMr. Trump\u2019s threats of a strike on Mr. Assad\u2019s forces, Mr. Nebenzya said, were \u201cunworthy of a permanent member of the Security Council.\u201d\nMs. Haley said she was incredulous at Mr. Nebenzya\u2019s defense of the Syrian government and his overall portrayal of events. \u201cI\u2019m in awe of how you say what you say with a straight face,\u201d she told him.\nFor all that, Russia loomed large in the discussions back in Washington about how to proceed. During an American military video conference call, several officials expressed concern about the possible Russian reaction to a strike on Syrian facilities, particularly in light of Moscow\u2019s threats to shoot down incoming missiles.\nDuring the call, military officials said that it was imperative to take steps to protect American Navy destroyers from Russian counterattacks. But a potential online strike loomed as a possibility \u2014 and a way for Russia and Iran to sidestep a direct confrontation with the United States military.\nJust weeks ago, the Department of Homeland Security identified Russia as the source of malware \u201cimplants\u201d in the American electric grid and released samples of code to utilities to help them clean out their systems. The warning accused Russia of mounting a series of intrusions against American and European nuclear power plants and water and electric systems, in what analysts interpreted as a move to test Moscow\u2019s capacity.\nIran hit American banks with a major denial of service attack nearly six years ago, and tried \u2014 unsuccessfully \u2014 to manipulate a dam in Westchester County, N.Y. Iran is among the most sophisticated midsize powers in using cyberweapons, skills that the country has invested in heavily since the United States and Israel conducted a crippling online attack on its nuclear enrichment sites.\nAs he prepared the military for retaliation, Mr. Mattis also warned of a potential propaganda counterattack by Syria, Russia and Iran after a Western strike. Defense Department officials underscored the need to show the world convincing evidence that Mr. Assad\u2019s government indeed initiated a chemical attack in Douma.\nRussian troops and mercenaries are deployed to Syria, and Iranian forces and militias are also in the country, and could retaliate against the thousands of American troops in Syria and Iraq. United States personnel in Erbil, a Kurdish city in northern Iraq, were readying for a potential Iranian attack on their forces there, according to an American official.\nWith days of warning that Mr. Trump planned to take action, Syria moved some of its aircraft to a Russian base in hopes of deterring Americans from attacking there \u2014 and, in turn, igniting aggressions between the two Cold War powers. Mr. Trump made sure not to target that base on Friday, averting the chance of hitting Russian targets but also sparing the Syrian air force.\nSenator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said hours before the strike that he was concerned that the military leadership was being too cautious. \u201cI\u2019m worried whether or not we have the right generals with the right mind-set,\u201d he said on Fox News Radio.\n\u201cIf our military leaders are listening to Putin and we back off because Putin threatens to retaliate, that is a disaster for us throughout the world,\u201d he added. \u201cYou can\u2019t let one dictator tell you what to do about another who has crossed two red lines.\u201d", "date": "April 13, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/13/world/middleeast/trump-syria-attack.html", "tags": "tough syria american iran president united talked \u201d trump restrained strike russia said"}
