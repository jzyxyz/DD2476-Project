{"title": "Candace Owens' Bonkers Take On Nationalism Includes A Defense Of Hitler", "content": "Frequent Fox News guest Candace Owens shared her understanding of nationalism and said if Adolf Hitler had been just a nationalist, that would have been all right\n\u201cI actually don\u2019t have any problems at all with the word \u2018nationalism.\u2019 I think that the definition gets poisoned by elitists that actually want globalism. Globalism is what I don\u2019t want. ... Whenever we say \u2018nationalism,\u2019 the first thing people think about, at least in America, is Hitler. You know, he was a national socialist, but if Hitler just wanted to make Germany great and have things run well, OK, fine,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe problem is that he wanted \u2014 he had dreams outside of Germany. He wanted to globalize. He wanted everybody to be German, everybody to be speaking German. Everybody to look a different way. That\u2019s not, to me, that\u2019s not nationalism. In thinking about how we could go bad down the line, I don\u2019t really have an issue with nationalism. I really don\u2019t. I think that it\u2019s OK,\u201d she continued.\nOwens,\u00a0the director of communications at the conservative advocacy group Turning Point USA, made the comments in December at a Turning Point event in England.\nBuzzFeed News reports\u00a0that she began her remarks by saying,\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re here to fight a culture war and we feel that we can win.\u201d\u00a0She brought up Hitler when she was asked by one member of the audience about nationalism in Western politics.\u00a0\nAfter the BuzzFeed report came out on Friday, a video surfaced of Owens\u2019 odd defense of the man responsible for killing millions of people. People on Twitter had a lot to say about her remarks:\nOwens is a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump, and he apparently admires her as well.\nIn May 2018 he tweeted praise for her, writing,\u00a0\u201cCandace Owens of Turning Point USA is having a big impact on politics in our Country. She represents an ever expanding group of very smart \u2018thinkers,\u2019 and it is wonderful to watch and hear the dialogue going on...so good for our Country!\u201d\u00a0\nPerhaps he\u2019ll have something to say in response to her thoughts now.", "date": "\n02/08/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/candace-owens-nationalism-hitler_n_5c5dc561e4b0650f4c0d95ec", "tags": "bonkers defense wanted \u2018 hitler think take owens candace nationalism say includes"}
