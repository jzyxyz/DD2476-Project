{"title": "China, Defiant but Careful, Promises Aggressive Response to Tariffs", "content": "BEIJING \u2014 When the United States ratcheted up trade tensions with Beijing on Friday, the news was greeted with weariness and foreboding among the people in China who will pay the immediate price: owners of factories big and small.\nBrook Chen runs a plant in Shanghai that makes suitcases for brands including Samsonite. More than four-fifths of his orders come from the United States.\nThe trade war, now nearly a year old, has already squeezed Mr. Chen\u2019s bottom line. American customers insisted that he lower his prices so they wouldn\u2019t have to raise theirs. When he contemplates moving production out of China \u2014 to Southeast Asia, for instance \u2014 he worries about losing access to China\u2019s vast supply chain and capable work force.\n\u201cThis is totally a lose-lose situation,\u201d Mr. Chen said. \u201cWe lose profits and have to shut down. American importers cannot find effective alternatives that can deliver products with the same quality.\u201d\nThe Chinese government issued a muted response on Friday after President Trump raised tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce vowed to retaliate, although it did not say how or when. Still, global financial markets \u2014 which have been hit by trade tensions in recent days \u2014 rose in hopes of an eventual deal.\nChina\u2019s heavily controlled news media have been walking a careful line, calling for defiance but not more dramatic action, such as a boycott of American products.\nBefore Friday\u2019s tariff increase, multiple state media outlets had published a cryptic, anonymously written article with the headline, \u201cIf You Want to Talk, We Can Talk. If You Want to Fight, We\u2019ll Fight.\u201d The article presented China as a calm, neutral presence upon which American policies had, very regrettably, exerted pressure.\nChinese people are polite by nature, the article said, yet unafraid of confrontation. \u201cWe are prepared to fight back,\u201d it said.\nThe question for Chinese leaders is how long the higher tariffs will last. China has ways to keep its economy humming, at least in the near term. Negotiators also have time to reach a deal, as the Trump administration effectively delayed the tariff increase by saying they only applied to goods that leave China on Friday or later. Oceangoing goods, in other words, won\u2019t get hit by the 25 percent levy until they arrive at American ports over the next few weeks.\nStill, China\u2019s economy has shown it isn\u2019t invulnerable. Some factories are already suffering.\n\u201cYou can definitely feel the anxiety,\u201d said Lu Mengxi, the founder of a winery in northwestern China that sells both domestically and abroad, including in the United States.\nWhat began last year as an investigation into China\u2019s practices toward American companies operating within its borders has turned into a sprawling conflict that has weighed on financial markets and economic activity across the globe.\nWhile analysts widely believe the two countries will eventually reach a deal to avert a trade dispute that could seriously hurt the world economy, the appetite for further conflict seems unabated on both sides.\nAmerican companies operating in China have generally chided both countries\u2019 governments for using tariffs to bring each other to the negotiating table. On Friday, however, Ker Gibbs, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, sounded more favorably inclined toward the Trump administration\u2019s policies and less tolerant of Beijing\u2019s.\n\u201cWhile many of our companies are hurt by the tariffs and ongoing trade tensions, we understand the U.S. government\u2019s frustration,\u201d Mr. Gibbs said in a statement. \u201cThere needs to be a deal that rebalances the economic relationship.\u201d\nFew in China appear to believe that a change of tactics is due, either.\n\u201cIt would be easy to do what a small minority of people in China are advocating, and to go along with America on everything,\u201d Hu Xijin, editor in chief of the state-run newspaper Global Times, wrote in a commentary on Friday. \u201cBut that just won\u2019t do. That would not be responsible to the people\u2019s interests.\u201d\n\u201cThe trade negotiations have gone on for so long because the two countries\u2019 fundamental interests cannot be reconciled,\u201d Nicole Zhang, 26, an employee at an online travel company, said while shopping in a Beijing mall on Friday. \u201cNational interests are unfeeling things like that. That\u2019s just how it is.\u201d\nAt the beginning of the year, China\u2019s position was more defensive. Its economic growth slowed in the second half of last year, in part because tariffs hurt business confidence. Since then, the Chinese government has poured billions of dollars into the financial system and pressed state-run banks into service extending credit.\nOfficials said last month that the economy grew 6.4 percent in the first quarter of the year, matching the pace from the previous quarter. Industrial output has been solid. Shoppers have opened their wallets.\nStill, for many Chinese businesses, especially those that sell overseas, uncertainty remains front of mind. China\u2019s exports to all major regions, not only to the United States, grew more slowly in the beginning of this year. Should the trade war intensify further, China may find it increasingly expensive to prop up its economy, and it could face another slowdown or widespread job losses.\nThe state news media have worked to reassure the country\u2019s consumers. In a headline published on Friday before the tariffs rose, the People\u2019s Daily newspaper, which is the Communist Party\u2019s mouthpiece, declared that Chinese trade \u201chas positive momentum and strong driving power.\u201d\nSome companies with business on both sides of the Pacific are trying to stay positive, too. N\u00e9e Lau, the owner of Amourvino Winery in Napa, Calif., said the tariffs China imposed last year had hurt his profits. Still, Mr. Lau said he would rather not raise prices, even if it meant earning less for now. Holding onto his overseas dealers and clients, he said, was more important to the long-term health of his business.\n\u201cThe United States and China will definitely come to some kind of agreement. It\u2019s just a matter of time,\u201d Mr. Lau said. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible for a war between two superpowers to go on forever.\u201d\nJason Wang, who owns a shoemaker in Fujian Province that sells to the American market, says that what frustrates him is that the tariff negotiations are taking place far from the people, like him, who are most directly affected.\nMr. Wang also lamented the nationalist sentiment on both sides that he felt had egged on the two countries\u2019 leaders. Americans, he said, probably felt that their country was taking a strong stance by imposing tariffs.\n\u201cAnd when China fights back, many praise the government for being tough,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBut I think no one actually wins in the end,\u201d Mr. Wang said. \u201cOrdinary people on both sides are paying the price.\u201d", "date": "May 10, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/10/business/china-trump-trade-tariffs-reaction.html", "tags": "american china \u201d defiant promises trade response friday careful year tariffs aggressive"}
