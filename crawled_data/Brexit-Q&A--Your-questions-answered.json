{"title": "Brexit Q&A: Your questions answered", "content": "What does the 585-page Brexit withdrawal agreement mean for you?\nBBC experts answer some of the most common questions you have sent us.\nIs there time for a renegotiation? @LonsYons\nChris Morris, Reality Check correspondent replies:\nIt would be difficult but not impossible: the rest of the EU would have to agree an extension of Article 50 - which they are not keen on.\nWhat is the chance of an European Economic Area (EEA)-European Free Trade Association (EFTA) deal? George Cazenove\nChris Morris, Reality Check correspondent replies:\nTrouble with this is that no-one has really asked Norway and co if they really want the UK to crash their party. It sounds like a simple solution, but would actually be very complex. Then again, which proposal isn't?\nWhat is the likelihood of this deal being approved by all 27 other EU members? James Blackford\nChris Morris, Reality Check correspondent replies:\nI think the other 27 would say yes if they thought the UK was committed to it. They've got plenty of other things to worry about other than Brexit. They want it sorted one way or another\nWhat will it mean for British citizens' freedom of travel and rights to live & work on the continent? Henry Covey    \nDaniel Sandford, Home affairs correspondent replies:\nThe headline is freedom of movement ends after the transition period finishes in December 2020, but until then British citizens and their families will continue to have the right to move to live and work in the EU, and vice versa.\nThose who take up residence before the end of the transition period will be allowed to remain beyond transition and, if they stay for five years, will be allowed to remain permanently.\nHowever, once the transition period is over, the draft agreement does allow the EU to require UK citizens who stay on to apply for a new residence document.\nWill the UK be free to make trade deals with other countries? Peter Hodge\nAndrew Walker, Economics correspondent replies:\nThe full answer is complicated. The short answer is: it looks like it would be difficult.\nFirst let's suppose we do end up activating the Northern Ireland backstop. That involves what the draft agreement calls a Single Customs Territory for the UK and the EU, which appears to be a customs union in all but name.  \nIn particular it says: \"Under no circumstances may the United Kingdom apply to its customs territory a customs tariff which is lower than the Common Customs Tariff (applied by the EU) for any good or import from any third country.\"  \nThat rules out the bread and butter of trade agreements, negotiating the reduction or elimination of tariffs. It might still be possible to do deals on services and also investment, which is an area that has often been added on to trade agreements.\nIf the backstop is not activated, then it depends on the shape of the agreement on the long-term relationship, which would be negotiated during the transition period. \nWe have an outline of the political declaration intended to guide those negotiations, which says the ultimate deal should \"build on the single customs territory provided for in the Withdrawal Agreement\". \nOn the face of it, that could run into the same difficulties as the backstop in terms of trade deals with other countries. If, however, it drops the prohibition on applying tariffs lower than the EU's, we would be in a position to negotiate conventional trade agreements with other countries.   \nWhat does the deal say about services, specifically regulations on UK financial services? Is there equivalence? Schwitt, London\nAndrew Walker, Economics correspondent replies:\nThis is a question for the long term rather than the Withdrawal Agreement.  The outline political declaration doesn't make a general commitment that there will be equivalence granted but it does refer to it. The EU and UK can take \"equivalence decisions in their own interest\".  \nThe document calls for assessments of equivalence to start as soon as possible after Brexit and be completed by the end of the transition period. \nBut I would emphasise this. It is just an outline to guide negotiations, not a definitive statement of where they will end.\nI am a UK national, living and studying within the EU, what impact would this have on me? Paul Blow, studying in Venlo in the Netherlands\nSean Coughlan, Education correspondent replies:\nThe future status of UK students in the EU and EU students in the UK still remains uncertain. \nUp to 2020, and during the transition period, not much would be expected to change. But the longer-term arrangements, about levels of tuition fees and access to student loans, have still to be decided. \nAt present, EU and UK students are treated the same for fees in each other's countries - which has seen some UK students going to university in low-fee countries such as the Netherlands. But it will have to be negotiated whether there will be any reciprocal deals to replace this.\nWill the EU still have access to UK waters and fish stocks? Stephen Knox\nChris Morris, Reality Check correspondent replies:\nOne policy area is excluded from these potential customs arrangements: fishing.\nThat's because the trade-off between access for UK fish produce to EU markets, and access for EU boats to UK waters, is too controversial. \nThe draft agreement simply states that \"the Union and the United Kingdom shall use their best endeavours to conclude and ratify\" an agreement \"on access to waters and fishing opportunities\".\nWill the European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) continue to have the same validity for UK citizens visiting the EU as is currently does? John Jarvis\nHugh Pym, Health Editor replies:\nUK citizens' rights to get healthcare in the EU and vice versa will be thrashed out during the transition period from March 2019 to December 2020.\nThe Government has drawn up a Bill to spell this out but it wont have any force till the transition talks work out how it will all work.  If there is no deal things get a lot more complicated!\nThe Reality Check team adds:\nDuring the transition period all EU law will continue to apply in the UK. That would mean that citizens would have exactly the same rights and guarantees as before - so, you'll still be able to use your card at least until the period ends.\nDo you have any questions about the draft withdrawal agreement?\nUse this form to ask your question: ", "date": "15 November 2018", "href": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46221696", "tags": "brexit q agreement uk eu replies answered transition correspondent period questions trade customs"}
