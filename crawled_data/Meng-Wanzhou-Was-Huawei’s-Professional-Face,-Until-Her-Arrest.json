{"title": "Meng Wanzhou Was Huawei\u2019s Professional Face, Until Her Arrest", "content": "BEIJING \u2014 As Huawei\u2019s finance chief and daughter of its founder, Meng Wanzhou has been a polished, professional face for a huge technology firm that long was opaque to the outside world.\nMs. Meng, the eldest daughter of Ren Zhengfei, the leader of the telecom equipment maker, has appeared before reporters to announce the company\u2019s financial results. She has spoken at company events in New York; Canc\u00fan, Mexico; and beyond. She helped inaugurate centers in Britain, a key market for the Chinese giant\u2019s expansion into the Western world.\nShe also sat on the board of a Huawei partner company in Hong Kong called Skycom Tech that Canadian authorities now say did business in Iran. And through that position and her job at Huawei, Ms. Meng may have personally been involved in tricking financial institutions into making transactions that violated United States sanctions against Iran, they said.\nThat has thrust Ms. Meng, 46, into the center of what promises to be a complex diplomatic tussle between the United States and China. She was arrested Dec. 1 in Vancouver, Canada, while changing flights, at the request of the American government, which is seeking to extradite her. The action escalated what had already been a roller-coaster year of economic conflict between the two powers, ahead of tricky negotiations to end a brutal trade war.\nHuawei has said that it is not aware of any wrongdoing by Ms. Meng, and China\u2019s Foreign Ministry has called for her immediate release.\nBut on Friday, in a bail hearing in British Columbia\u2019s Supreme Court, Canadian authorities said Ms. Meng was accused of fraud. They said she had \u201cdirect involvement\u201d with Huawei\u2019s representations to banks, telling at least one financial executive that Huawei and Skycom were operating in Iran in strict compliance with United States sanctions when that was not the case.\nLarry Kudlow, director of the White House\u2019s National Economic Council, said on CNBC on Friday that the United States had repeatedly warned Huawei about violating sanctions on Iran.\n\u201cWe have these sanctions on Iran, it runs against our policy, why shouldn\u2019t we enforce that?\u201d he said.\nFor years, Ms. Meng\u2019s name has appeared in connection with Huawei\u2019s business in Iran, the subject of a yearslong United States investigation.\nReuters reported several years ago that Skycom, one of Huawei\u2019s partners in that country, had tried to sell Hewlett-Packard equipment to an Iranian telecom carrier in 2010. The sale, which Huawei said was never completed, would have violated Washington\u2019s ban on exporting computer products to Iran.\nHuawei said at the time that its Iranian business was entirely lawful, and that it required its local partners to heed the same laws and regulations.\nAccording to Hong Kong corporate filings, Ms. Meng was a member of Skycom\u2019s board from February 2008 to April 2009.\nIn a May 2007 filing, Skycom reported that all of the company\u2019s shares had been transferred that year to a Hong Kong company called Hua Ying Management. In August 2007, Hua Ying reported to the Hong Kong authorities that its company secretary was Ms. Meng.\nMs. Meng, who started at Huawei as a secretary 25 years ago, is not its most prominent executive. But as chief financial officer, she has played a part in the company\u2019s efforts over the past five years to become more transparent about its operations. After United States lawmakers labeled Huawei and another Chinese manufacturer, ZTE, as security threats, Huawei saw openness as a way to help dispel the swirl of suspicions surrounding it.\nSome of the distrust has had to do with Ms. Meng\u2019s powerful and secretive father.\nMr. Ren, 74, was a member of the Chinese military\u2019s engineering corps for nearly a decade before starting Huawei in 1987. His military service has informed American officials\u2019 concerns that Huawei has links to the Chinese government or the Communist Party \u2014 something the company has strenuously denied.\n\u201cShe\u2019s very presentable,\u201d Duncan Clark, the chairman of the advisory firm BDA China, who once did consulting work for Huawei, said of Ms. Meng.\nThat is a stark contrast with her father, Mr. Clark added. \u201cHe is, for me at least, refreshingly unpolished and direct.\u201d\nFor many people in China, Huawei represents how far their nation has come since it began climbing out of the economic ravages left by Chairman Mao \u2014 and how far it can continue to go.\nOver the past three decades, Huawei has transformed from a small maker of telephone switches into the world\u2019s largest supplier of telecommunications equipment, as well as the No. 2 smartphone maker, behind Samsung. The company has worked to build a consumer brand associated with quality and innovation. The name \u201cHuawei\u201d means \u201cChina\u2019s Achievement.\u201d\nBut after winning over cellular providers across the developing world with its cost-effective networking gear, the company faced a tougher task convincing large carriers in the wealthier nations of Europe and North America.\nFor many years, Mr. Ren\u2019s reluctance to appear in public, combined with the company\u2019s aversion to the news media, even after it had become a globe-straddling giant, fed the impression that he and Huawei had something to hide. How much of the company did he own? How did key decisions get made? Could there really be a military link?\nMs. Meng became part of an attempt to address such issues in January 2013, when she was brought before reporters in Beijing to discuss Huawei\u2019s business outlook. The company, which is privately held, had published some financial details before. But it had never held a news conference of this kind.\n\u201cWe will honor our commitment to transparency and openness,\u201d Ms. Meng said then.\nThis commitment has failed to persuade the United States government that Huawei\u2019s products are safe to use, but the company has become a supplier to many of Europe\u2019s telecom providers.\nThis year, Ms. Meng was made Huawei\u2019s deputy chairwoman in addition to finance chief, leading some to wonder whether she might succeed her father at the top someday. But hers was not an heiress\u2019s upbringing.\nMs. Meng, who also uses the names Sabrina and Cathy, was born in 1972 in the western city of Chengdu, to Mr. Ren\u2019s first wife, Meng Jun. The family moved to Shenzhen, in China\u2019s south, during the turbulent economic reforms of the 1980s.\nShenzhen eventually became a hub of China\u2019s mighty manufacturing base and home to Huawei\u2019s global headquarters. Back then, it was a backwater.\nAs Ms. Meng later recalled in a Huawei employee newspaper, the walls of the family\u2019s house let in all the neighbors\u2019 chatter. The roof leaked. When it rained \u2014 which it did constantly in southern China \u2014 everything got wet.\nAfter college, Ms. Meng hoped to attend graduate school in the United States. A university gave her an offer, she recalled in a 2016 speech. But her visa was rejected because an American consular interviewer decided that her English was too poor.\nMs. Meng found a job at a bank instead. She was laid off after a year. In 1993, she joined fledgling Huawei as one of its three secretaries.\nShe answered the phone, printed out documents and put together product catalogs. A few years later, after completing a master\u2019s degree in management, she returned to Huawei, this time in the finance department. And she began climbing the ladder.\nAs Huawei\u2019s business spread across the world in the 2000s, Ms. Meng helped expand its accounting operations with it. Her brother, Ren Ping, works for a Huawei-owned company.
