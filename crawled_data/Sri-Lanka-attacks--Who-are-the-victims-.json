{"title": "Sri Lanka attacks: Who are the victims?", "content": "Sri Lanka is in shock after a wave of bombings targeting churches and hotels left at least 253 people dead and about 500 injured. The bombers struck on Easter Sunday in the cities of Colombo, Negombo and Batticaloa. \nThe death toll from Sunday's blasts had stood at 359 but was revised down by more than 100 on Thursday. The health ministry blamed a calculation error. \nMost of those killed are Sri Lankans, but officials say at least 38 foreigners are among the dead - including British, Indian, Danish, Dutch, Swiss, Spanish, US, Australian and Turkish nationals. \nThe government temporarily restricted some social media networks to try to halt the spread of misinformation, so details were initially slow to emerge. \nBut this is what we know so far about those who lost their lives.\nOne of the first victims to have been identified was Sri Lankan celebrity chef Shantha Mayadunne. \nHer daughter Nisanga Mayadunne had posted a picture of the family having breakfast in the Shangri-La hotel in Colombo shortly before the explosion there. \nOne of their family members later posted on Facebook confirming that both Shantha and Nisanga had died, saying \"no words can describe the pain\". \nRangana Fernando, his wife Danadiri and their three children all died in the attack on St Sebastian's church in Negombo, north of the capital.\n\"Farewell Danadiri and family, we will remember you all in our prayers,\" read a tribute from her colleagues.\n\"She was a dedicated and diligent worker, but above all a kind and caring soul. She will be dearly missed.\"\nThe couple's eldest child Biola (below, third from right) was six, Leona four and Seth just 11 months. \nUnicef says at least 45 of those who lost their lives in the attacks were children. \nFour Sri Lankan staff members at the Taprobane restaurant in the Cinnamon Grand hotel died in the attacks. \n\"It was a busy morning. It's Sunday morning during buffet breakfast so it's one of our busiest periods,\" the Cinnamon Grand hotel spokesman told the BBC. \n\"They were servers at the restaurant. One of them was working at the live food stations making hoppers [a Sri Lankan pancake].\"\nThey have been identified only as Shantha, Sanjeewani, Ibrahim and Nisthar. \nThe Shangri-La Hotel in Colombo has told the BBC that four of its colleagues were \"fatally injured in the course of their duties\".\nNo further details are known so far. \nSri Lankan Ramesh Raju was at Zion Church in Batticaloa during its Easter service when a stranger carrying a huge backpack tried to enter, saying he wanted to film the service. \nBut Ramesh told the man he could not enter with a large bag and forced him outside the church. Just after he did so, the bomb detonated. \nHe leaves behind a wife and two children, all of whom were attending the service with him.\nMary Otricia Johnson was at Mass with her family at St Anthony's in Colombo when the attack happened, according to the New York Times. \nHer eldest daughter, Sharon Silviya, had taken her son to the front of the church to look at a fish tank. Minutes later, the blast occurred. \nMs Silviya and her son survived the attack. \nTwelve-year-old Sharon Santhakumar and his younger sister, 11-year-old Sarah Santhakumar, were among those killed at Zion church in Batticoloa.\nThey were buried next to each other the day after they were killed.\nTyronne Gulding, 56, went to Easter Mass with his wife, Gayani Fernando, and his mother-in-law, Mary Anaslyn Silva. \nAll three died in the blast at St Sebastian's church in Negombo. A neighbour who was with them and survived says they were standing very close to the person believed to have detonated the bomb, but did not see his face. \nTyronne's friends say they called him Sana. He drove an auto-rickshaw and ran his business from outside Negombo hospital. His wife was unemployed and mostly took care of her mother and 18-year-old son. \nHe did not attend the Mass with them as he had gone for midnight vigil the previous night.\nSubramani Christopher, 28, was a driver and odd jobs man who died in the blast at St Anthony's church in Colombo. \nHe was originally from Akuressa in the south of the country, but was working in Colombo, where he lived in a tiny house near the church for which he paid 10,000 ($57; \u00a344) rupees a month. \nHe had been married only 11 months. He had gone to church with his wife and infant son on Easter. His wife and child survived but he did not. \nHis mother travelled to Colombo after hearing that there had been a blast at the church. Initially relatives had told her that he had been receiving treatment for a minor leg injury. It was only after she arrived that the truth was broken to her. \n\"He was my life. He was my left hand. He loved me so much. Only I know how much he loved me,\" his mother tells BBC News's Ayeshea Perera. \"I can't bear this, how will I bear his loss?\" \nHis wife, neighbours say, has not been told yet that he has died. \n\"What do we tell her?\" A neighbour asked. \"How can we tell her that he has died?\" \nHis mother says she cannot bear to look her daughter-in-law in the face. \n\"The only thing I can take comfort in is that he is with Jesus. I swear I will look after his son. It was so funny, but even before his son was born he had told his wife that if anything happened to him he wanted me to look after his child. He had such big dreams for his child, even before he was born. I swear that I will dedicate the rest of my life to bringing up his child and making sure that he has a bright future.\"\nBennington Joseph, 33, was killed in the blast in St Anthony's church along with his wife, Subramaniam Arumugam Chandrika. \nTheir three young sons Bevon, 9, Cleavon, 6, and Avon, an 11-month-old baby, also died in the bombing. Avon's first birthday would have been on 5 May.\n\"We had planned to celebrate his first birthday and baptism on that same day,\" Baby Joseph, Bennington Joseph's father, tells BBC Tamil's Jayakumar Sudandhirapandiyan.\nBaby Joseph adds that he grew up in Kochchikade, but later moved to a different area of Colombo with his wife and children.\n\"Even then I went to the same church in search of my almighty. But today in that shrine my children's blood is shed in the floors,\" he says.\nSampath, 35, his two daughters aged eight and 10, and two nephews aged six and 10 had gone to St Sebastian's Church in Negombo for the Easter Mass.\nHis cousin, Sajeewa Fernando who lives in the UK, tells BBC News: \"I was really shocked when I heard what happened in Negombo, my birth place.
