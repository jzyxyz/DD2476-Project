This is the new face of what we deal with,\" New South Wales state police Deputy Commissioner Catherine Burn said. \nTimeline: Australia's terror threat\nThe arrest comes two days after a teenage boy was charged with making threats at Sydney Opera House.\nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said last week the threat of a terror attack in the nation was \"real\" after an IS call to followers to target prominent Australian locations.", "date": "11 September 2016", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-37331672", "tags": "australia inspired man terrorism police say australian attacker state sydney new charged"}
