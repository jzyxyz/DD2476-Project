{"title": "Nikolas Cruz, Florida Shooting Suspect, Described as a \u2018Troubled Kid\u2019", "content": "For the latest on the Florida school shooting, read our Thursday live updates.\nThe man suspected of opening fire inside a Florida high school on Wednesday, killing at least 17 people, is a former student who had been expelled for disciplinary reasons, the authorities said.\nSheriff Scott Israel of Broward County, Fla., said that the man, Nikolas Cruz, 19, previously attended Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland but was expelled after getting into trouble. He was enrolled at another Broward County school, officials said.\nOn Thursday, the authorities charged Mr. Cruz with 17 counts of premeditated murder.\nIn the hours after the shooting, people who knew Mr. Cruz described him as a \u201ctroubled kid\u201d who enjoyed showing off his firearms, bragging about killing animals and whose mother would resort to calling the police to have them come to their home to try to talk some sense into him. At a school with about 3,000 students, Mr. Cruz stayed to himself and had few friends but struck fear in some students with erratic behavior and an affinity for violence.\n\u201cHe always had guns on him,\u201d the student, who did not give his name, told WFOR-TV. \u201cThe crazy stuff that he did was not right for school, and he got kicked out of school multiple times for that kind of stuff.\u201d\nJim Gard, a math teacher at Stoneman Douglas High School, said in an interview that Mr. Cruz was a student in his class during the first semester of the 2016-17 school year. In the class, he was quiet and not disruptive, Mr. Gard said.\nBut he recalled that school administrators became concerned last year about Mr. Cruz\u2019s behavior and alerted the faculty. \u201cWe received emails about him from the administration,\u201d Mr. Gard said in an interview, adding that he did not recall the specific issues.\nAfter the shooting on Wednesday, Mr. Gard said that several students told him that Mr. Cruz was taken with a girl at Stoneman Douglas High School \u201cto the point of stalking her.\u201d\nIn the interview with the Miami news station, the student said Mr. Cruz was a junior at Stoneman Douglas High School when he was expelled last year. He said that students would joke that if anyone were to open fire inside the school, it would be Mr. Cruz. Because of that, students feared him and mostly stayed away from him, the student said.\n\u201cA lot of people were saying that it would be him,\u201d the student told WFOR-TV. \u201cThey would say he would be the one to shoot up the school. Everyone predicted it.\u201d\nBrandon Minoff, a student at Stoneman Douglas High School, said in an interview with CNN that a teacher assigned him to work with Mr. Cruz on a group project two years ago. Mr. Cruz was quiet in class but opened up during their project, Mr. Minoff said, telling him that he had been kicked out of two private schools, had been held back twice and aspired to join the military.\n\u201cHe was always to himself and never tried to associate himself with anyone,\u201d Mr. Minoff said. \u201cAs far as I know, he didn\u2019t have any friends.\u201d\nSchool officials declined to say why Mr. Cruz no longer attended Douglas High School. But Amanda Samaroo, whose daughter, Elizabeth, attended the school while he was a student there, said he had been expelled for bringing knives on campus. \u201cHer friends have said he was known to always be mentally ill and would kill animals,\u201d Ms. Samaroo said.\nHelen Pasciolla, who is retired, lives on an elegant street in the Pine Tree Estates development in Parkland, three houses down and across from where the Cruz family resided until about a year ago. Ms. Pasciolla said that Mr. Cruz told her that the family had to move out of their one-story beige house and sell it because they could no longer afford it.\nShe said that Mr. Cruz has a brother, Zachary, and that both boys were adopted. Their adoptive father died some years ago, she added.\nMs. Pasciolla said that the boys\u2019 mother, Lynda Cruz, had regular problems with their behavior. On occasion, she said, the mother would resort to calling the police to have them come over to try to talk some sense into her sons.\n\u201cI think she wanted to scare them a little bit,\u201d Ms. Pasciolla said. \u201cNikolas has behavioral problems, I think, but I never thought he would be violent.\u201d\nWhen she saw his picture on TV on Wednesday after the shooting, Ms. Pasciolla said that she thought to herself, \u201cOh, my God, that\u2019s the kid who lived down the street.\u201d\nSheriff Israel said that the authorities did not yet know the motive for the killing, but were learning more about Mr. Cruz through his social media pages, which he described as \u201cvery, very concerning.\u201d\nScreen shots of an Instagram page said to belong to Mr. Cruz show many photos of a man holding firearms and ammunition used in a semiautomatic AR-15 rifle. One photo shows several guns, including rifles with scopes, lying on a bed. Another appears to show a frog that had been killed.\nAfter Mr. Cruz left Douglas High School, he took a job at a Dollar Tree store about a mile and a half from the school. A person who answered the phone at the store on Wednesday evening said that Mr. Cruz worked as a cashier and was well liked by his colleagues.\n\u201cHe was a great guy,\u201d the person said.\nHe added that he last saw Mr. Cruz about a year ago before he transferred to another Dollar Tree store closer to his home.\nAnother student at Douglas High School, Ocean Parodie, told The Daily Beast that he visited the store after Mr. Cruz was expelled to check on him. \u201cHe said he was expelled and was happy that he was thrown out,\u201d Mr. Parodie said. \u201cI felt bad for him.\u201d", "date": "Feb. 14, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/14/us/nikolas-cruz-florida-shooting.html", "tags": "shooting suspect \u2018 mr. cruz kid high nikolas described school \u201d douglas student florida troubled"}
