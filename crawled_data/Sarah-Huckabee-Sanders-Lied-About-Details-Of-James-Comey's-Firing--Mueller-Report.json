{"title": "Sarah Huckabee Sanders Lied About Details Of James Comey's Firing- Mueller Report", "content": "White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, during a 2017 press conference, lied about the circumstances surrounding James Comey\u2019s ouster as FBI director, according to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s newly released report.\nOn May 10, 2017, Sanders told reporters that President Donald Trump had decided to fire Comey a day earlier, only after Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein recommended he do so.\nBut Mueller\u2019s nearly 400-page report, a redacted version of which was released to the public on Thursday, states otherwise.\n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d indicates Trump fired Comey for refusing to publicly state that the president wasn\u2019t personally under investigation, according to the report.\n\u201cIn the immediate aftermath of the firing, the President dictated a press statement suggesting that he had acted based on the [Department of Justice] recommendations, and White House press officials repeated that story,\u201d Mueller wrote in his report. \u201cBut the President had decided to fire Comey before the White House solicited those recommendations.\u201d\nThe report continues: \u201cAlthough the President ultimately acknowledged that he was going to fire Comey regardless of the Department of Justice\u2019s recommendations, he did so only after DOJ officials made clear to him that they would resist the White House\u2019s suggestion that they had prompted the process that led to Comey\u2019s termination.\u201d\u00a0\nWhat\u2019s more, Sanders claimed during that White House press briefing that the \u201crank-and-file of the FBI had lost confidence in their director.\u201d\nA day later, on May 11, then-acting FBI Director McCabe testified before a Senate panel that Comey had in fact \u201cenjoyed broad support within the FBI and still does to this day.\u201d\n\u201cI can confidently tell you that the majority, the vast majority of FBI employees enjoyed a deep and positive connection to Director Comey,\u201d he said.\nWhen a reporter asked Sanders that day about her comments, which directly contradicted McCabe\u2019s testimony, she said she was speaking to her \u201cown personal experience.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard from countless members of the FBI that are grateful and thankful for the president\u2019s decision,\u201d Sanders said from the podium. \u201cAnd I think that we may have to agree to disagree. I\u2019m sure that there are some people that are disappointed, but I certainly heard from a large number of individuals \u2014 and that\u2019s just myself \u2014 and I don\u2019t even know that many people in the FBI.\u201d\nBut that was also a lie, according to Mueller\u2019s report. Sanders admitted to the special counsel\u2019s office that her claim that Comey had lost the confidence of rank-and-file FBI agents was wholly fabricated.\n\u201cFollowing the press conference, Sanders spoke to the President, who told her she did a good job and did not point out any inaccuracies in her comments,\u201d according to the report. \u201cSanders told this Office that her reference to hearing from \u2018countless members of the FBI\u2019 was a \u2018slip of the tongue.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cShe also recalled that her statement in a separate press interview that rank-and-file FBI agents had lost confidence in Comey was a comment she made \u2018in the heat of the moment\u2019 that was not founded on anything,\u201d the report added.\u00a0\nSanders did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment.\nComey has long maintained that the White House lied about his reputation at the FBI. In June 2018, Comey said the Trump administration had tried to \u201cdefame me\u201d by claiming FBI employees had lost trust in him.\n\u201cThose were lies, plain and simple,\u201d Comey said, adding that leading the bureau was the honor of his life.", "date": "\n04/18/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/sarah-huckabee-sanders-lied-mueller-report_n_5cb8a6b7e4b06605e3ec53c8", "tags": "report details comey firing- lied \u201d white house huckabee james sarah fbi sanders press mueller"}
