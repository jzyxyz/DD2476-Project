{"title": "Comey Expected to Testify Before Senate, if He Isn\u2019t Blocked", "content": "Senators expect the former F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, to testify next week about his conversations with President Trump, congressional officials said on Wednesday, setting up a test of the White House\u2019s willingness to cooperate with investigations into Mr. Trump\u2019s associates.\nPutting the highly anticipated hearing on the calendar would force Mr. Trump to decide whether to invoke executive privilege and try to prevent Mr. Comey from testifying. Mr. Comey is expected to be asked about several conversations he had with the president, including one in which he says Mr. Trump encouraged him to stop investigating his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn.\nSeparately, the House Intelligence Committee issued subpoenas on Wednesday to Mr. Flynn and the president\u2019s longtime lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, for documents and their testimony. And in an unusual move, the Republican chairman of the House panel \u2014 who has recused himself from leading the investigation \u2014 unilaterally issued a series of subpoenas to the intelligence community. The chairman, Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California, is seeking information about how Obama administration officials handled sensitive information about Trump associates.\nBut Mr. Comey\u2019s testimony would be the most sensational moment to date in a controversy that has engulfed the Trump administration from its beginning. Congress and a Justice Department special counsel are investigating whether Mr. Trump\u2019s associates colluded with Russia to meddle in the 2016 presidential election.\nCourts have recognized a president\u2019s constitutional right to keep his discussions a secret in most instances. A White House spokeswoman had no comment on whether Mr. Trump planned to try to block Mr. Comey\u2019s testimony. It is a delicate decision with political and legal consequences.\n\u201cIf they claim executive privilege, politically it gives the appearance that there\u2019s something to hide, which just amplifies all the criticism,\u201d said Mark J. Rozell, a George Mason University professor and the author of a book on the history of executive privilege.\nAmerican intelligence agencies have concluded that Russian hackers and propagandists worked to tip the election in Mr. Trump\u2019s favor, and investigators want to know whether anyone around Mr. Trump helped that effort. Mr. Trump has repeatedly denied that anyone did.\nSome in Congress have suggested that Mr. Trump was trying to obstruct the Justice Department investigation by demanding Mr. Comey\u2019s loyalty, asking him to drop the inquiry, and then firing him last month after being rebuffed. Mr. Trump has fueled that suspicion by publicly disparaging the F.B.I. investigation, saying that he was thinking about the case when he dismissed Mr. Comey, and then telling Russian diplomats that the firing had relieved pressure on him.\nRobert S. Mueller III, the Justice Department special counsel, has the authority to investigate obstruction. Current and former law enforcement officials have said that F.B.I. agents will most likely question many White House officials as part of that case. Mr. Comey\u2019s testimony could be relevant to Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigations.\nMr. Comey kept detailed memos on his meetings. The F.B.I. has refused to give them to Congress, citing Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation. But Mr. Comey has told Congress he is willing to testify publicly, and Mr. Mueller has so far not tried to stop him.\nThe Justice Department has wide latitude to demand documents and testimony as part of a criminal investigation, even when executive privilege applies. That means Mr. Mueller would most likely prevail if he tried to force Mr. Comey to speak to his investigators, even over White House objections. Having Mr. Comey testify before Congress, however, would spare Mr. Mueller a legal fight.\nMr. Trump has made it much harder to assert executive privilege by repeatedly and publicly referring to his conversations with Mr. Comey, Mr. Rozell said. \u201cHow can you amplify your views publicly and then, in response to a legitimate inquiry, say \u2018I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t talk about that\u2019?\u201d Mr. Rozell said. Mr. Trump, he said, \u201chas not been careful.\u201d\nSeveral congressional committees want Mr. Comey to testify about his firing, but the former F.B.I. director chose to appear in front of the intelligence panel, where he has performed well over the years. At his last congressional hearing, before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee a week before he was fired, he was sharply criticized by Republicans and Democrats for how he handled the investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s email server last year.\nAs the Senate committee prepared for Mr. Comey\u2019s testimony, House investigators moved forward on Wednesday with their own inquiry.\nBoth Mr. Flynn and Mr. Cohen, a longtime associate of Mr. Trump who acted as a spokesman during his campaign, refused to comply with the House panel\u2019s initial requests, forcing it to issue subpoena for the information.\nThe subpoenas were issued to Flynn Intel Group L.L.C., Mr. Flynn\u2019s firm. The firm was paid more than $500,000 to represent Turkey in a dispute with the United States government while Mr. Flynn was advising the Trump campaign. He belatedly registered as a foreign agent for that work after being forced out of the Trump administration for misrepresenting his communications with the Russian ambassador to Vice President Mike Pence.\nSeparately, Representative Adam Schiff, Democrat of California, dismissed accusations from Carter Page, another Trump adviser who is under scrutiny, that the committee is preventing him from testifying.\nMr. Schiff, the House panel\u2019s top Democrat, said the investigation would first review relevant documents before interviewing witnesses. \u201cAnd while we anticipate interviews to begin shortly, we have agreed that the pace of those interviews will be dictated by the needs of the investigation and not the preferences of outside parties,\u201d Mr. Schiff said in a statement.\nMr. Trump threw his own fuel on that fire on Wednesday. \u201cSo now it is reported that the Democrats, who have excoriated Carter Page about Russia, don\u2019t want him to testify,\u201d he said in a series of Twitter posts. \u201cHe blows away their case against him & now wants to clear his name by showing \u2018the false or misleading testimony by James Comey, John Brennan\u2026\u2019 Witch Hunt!\u201d\nMr. Brennan was C.I.A. director during the Obama administration. The House committee also issued three subpoenas related to the \u201cunmasking\u201d of Trump associates within classified reports, according to a congressional official. The subpoenas went to the National Security Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency, the official said.", "date": "May 31, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/31/us/politics/james-comey-testify-trump-russia-fbi.html", "tags": "testimony comey investigation \u201d trump expected house senate flynn blocked testify"}
