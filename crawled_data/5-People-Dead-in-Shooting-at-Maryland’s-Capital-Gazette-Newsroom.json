{"title": "5 People Dead in Shooting at Maryland\u2019s Capital Gazette Newsroom", "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Md. \u2014 A man armed with a shotgun and smoke grenades stormed into the newsroom of a community newspaper chain in Maryland\u2019s capital on Thursday afternoon, killing five staff members, injuring two others and prompting law enforcement agencies across the country to provide protection at the headquarters of media organizations.\nThe suspect, Jarrod W. Ramos, 38, was taken into custody at the scene and was charged on Friday morning with five counts of first-degree murder. He had a long history of conflict with the Capital Gazette, which produces a number of local newspapers along Maryland\u2019s shore, suing journalists there for defamation and waging a social media campaign against them.\n\u201cThis was a targeted attack on the Capital Gazette,\u201d said William Krampf, acting chief of the Anne Arundel County Police Department. \u201cThis person was prepared to shoot people. His intent was to cause harm.\u201d\nA bail hearing for Mr. Ramos was scheduled for 10:30 a.m. Friday in Annapolis, according to Maryland court records, which did not list a lawyer for him but said Mr. Ramos was eligible to be represented by a public defender.\n[Annapolis gunman barricaded door in newsroom shooting, police say.]\nThe chilling attack was covered in real time by some of the journalists who found themselves under siege. A message saying \u201cplease help us\u201d with the address of the office building was tweeted from the account of Anthony Messenger, a summer intern. A crime reporter, Phil Davis, described how the gunman \u201cshot through the glass door to the office\u201d before opening fire on employees.\n\u201cThere is nothing more terrifying than hearing multiple people get shot while you\u2019re under your desk and then hear the gunman reload,\u201d Mr. Davis wrote.\n[Read about the victims of the Capital Gazette shooting.]\nFor a country that has grown numb to mass shootings, this was a new front. Schools have become a frequent target, with college students on down to kindergartners falling victim. A movie theater was shot up. Churches, too. But this was a rare attack on a news organization, one of the oldest in America, which dates its roots back to the 1700s and boasts on its website that it once fought the stamp tax that helped give rise to the American Revolution.\nThe gunman was silent as he stalked the newsroom, stopping once to reload as journalists huddled in fear under their desks, Mr. Davis said in a telephone interview. Once the police arrived, staff members put their hands in the air and shouted, \u201cWe\u2019re not him,\u201d Mr. Davis recalled. The gunman was hiding under a desk as the police moved in. He did not exchange gunfire with officers when he was taken in.\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t have enough bullets for us,\u201d Mr. Davis said, struggling to grapple with the images of his fallen colleagues. \u201cIt was terrifying to know he didn\u2019t have enough bullets to kill everyone in that office, and had to get more.\u201d\n[Read more on how the shooting unfolded.]\nAfter his arrest, Mr. Ramos refused to cooperate with the authorities or provide his name. He was identified using facial recognition technology, said a law enforcement official who was not authorized to speak on the record.\nIn July 2012, Mr. Ramos filed a defamation lawsuit in Maryland\u2019s Prince George\u2019s County Circuit Court against Capital Gazette Communications, its then editor and publisher and a former reporter, claiming that his reputation had been damaged after the newspaper published a story the prior year about Mr. Ramos\u2019s guilty plea in a harassment case. Three months later, he filed a fuller complaint alleging invasion of privacy.\nThe lawsuit was later dismissed with prejudice by Judge Maureen M. Lamasney after a March 2013 hearing, in which she asked Mr. Ramos to identify anything that was falsely reported in the July 2011 article and to cite examples about how he had been harmed. He was unable to do so, according to a partial transcript of the hearing published in an appellate court decision two years later.\nMr. Ramos represented himself and, according to the appellate decision that later affirmed the dismissal, showed no understanding of defamation law.\nThe article was published in July 2011 with the headline \u201cJarrod Wants to Be Your Friend,\u201d and detailed a harassment charge against Mr. Ramos. According to the article, Mr. Ramos sent a friend request on Facebook to a former high school classmate and over the course of several months, he \u201calternately asked for help, called her vulgar names and told her to kill herself.\u201d\nThe harassment continued for nearly a year. He pleaded guilty in July 2011 to harassment and was sentenced to 18 months of supervised probation and ordered to attend counseling.\nAccording to the article, Mr. Ramos had no prior criminal history. He had a degree in computer engineering and at the time had worked for six years for the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nThursday\u2019s shooting prompted law enforcement officials throughout the country to protect media organizations. As the day proceeded, however, investigators were looking into whether the attack was an isolated grudge.\n\u201cJarrod Ramos has a long history of being angry and taking action against The Capital newspaper,\u201d said Tom Marquardt, a former executive editor and publisher at The Capital. \u201cI said at one time to my attorneys that this was a guy that was going to come and shoot us. I was concerned on my behalf and on behalf of my staff that he was going to take more than legal action.\u201d\nLate Thursday night, the dead were identified as Gerald Fischman, 61, the newsroom\u2019s editorial page editor; Rob Hiaasen, 59, an editor and features columnist; John McNamara, 56, a sports reporter and editor for the local weekly papers; Wendi Winters, 65, a local news reporter and community columnist; and Rebecca Smith, a sales assistant.\nIn a telephone interview on Thursday, the writer Carl Hiaasen confirmed that his brother, Rob, had been one of those killed in the newsroom.\nCarl Hiaasen \u2014 a longtime columnist for The Miami Herald \u2014 said that he had no information about what had transpired, but that his family was \u201cdevastated beyond words.\u201d\n\u201cHe was dedicated to journalism. He spent his whole life as a journalist,\u201d he said.\nPresident Trump said on Twitter that he had been briefed on Thursday\u2019s shooting. \u201cMy thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families,\u201d he said. His spokeswoman, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, tweeted later: \u201cStrongly condemn the evil act of senseless violence in Annapolis, MD. A violent attack on innocent journalists doing their job is an attack on every American.\u201d\nPast and present employees of the newspaper chain were struggling to understand what could have prompted such an attack.\n\u201cThe Capital, like all newspapers, angered people every day in its pursuit of the news,\u201d Mr. Marquardt wrote on Facebook. \u201cIn my day, people protested by writing letters to the editor; today it\u2019s through the barrel of a gun. Sure, I had death threats and the paper had bomb threats. But we shrugged them off as part of the business we were in.\u201d\nThe New York Police Department said its decision to deploy officers to news organizations was not based on any specific threat, \u201cbut rather out of an abundance of caution until we learn more about the suspect and motives behind the Maryland shooting.\u201d The department described such deployments as \u201ca standard practice to shift resources strategically during active shooter or terrorist events.\u201d\nGabrielle Giffords, a former Arizona congresswoman who was shot in the head by a gunman in 2011 during a campaign event, directed her ire at lawmakers for not reacting to the country\u2019s spate of mass shootings. \u201cReporters shouldn\u2019t have to hide from gunfire while doing their jobs,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cA summer intern in the newsroom shouldn\u2019t have to tweet for help. We shouldn\u2019t have to live in a country where our lawmakers refuse to take any action to address this uniquely American crisis that\u2019s causing so much horror and heartbreak on what feels like a daily basis.\u201d\nThe Capital Gazette has a long history. The Capital, founded as an afternoon paper in 1884, is \u201cthe ultimate local newspaper,\u201d said Steve Gunn, a former editor. It merged with The Gazette, which has an even older pedigree.\nOwned by a local family until 1968, the paper underwent a period of expansion after being purchased by Philip Merrill, a former American diplomat and NATO official, who served as its publisher until his death by suicide in 2006.\nMr. Merrill pushed national news off the front page, instead building the paper into a local force. City council meetings and features on local heroes were staples. But it also strove to hold local institutions accountable, winning national attention in 1991 for a series of stories on hazing and sexual harassment at the Naval Academy.\nThe paper was a training ground for reporters who had little experience \u2014 or zero experience, but a lot of attitude, Mr. Marquardt said. Many went on to work at larger news organizations, including The New York Times.\nAt its height, the company employed some 250 people and operated its own printing press, Mr. Marquardt said. In more recent years, the news staff has shrunk. A staff member said on Twitter on Thursday afternoon that it now stands at about 20, with a few more on the advertising staff.\n\u201cEveryone left there stuck to their profession because they loved what they did,\u201d Mr. Marquardt said. \u201cTo die like this is a tragedy that you can\u2019t fathom.\u201d\nAfter it was purchased by the Baltimore Sun Media Group in 2014, the company moved to an office building, across from a local mall, which was the site of Thursday\u2019s shooting.\nShortly before 6 p.m., at least three helicopters were still circling, and lines of silent police cars, with lights flashing, blocked off the main roads leading up to the newsroom at 888 Bestgate Road. Yellow police tape flapped in the wind, keeping people and journalists away from the area.\nEven as the authorities continued to pore over the newsroom for clues, the Capital Gazette announced Thursday that it would be publishing an edition on Friday.\nShortly after 9 p.m., several tired reporters and a photographer from the Capital Gazette were filing stories and photographs from their laptops, set up in the back of a silver pickup truck in the parking lot of the Westfield Annapolis Mall, across the street from their newsroom.\nE. B. Furgurson III, a reporter, stood in a blue shirt and khaki pants with his colleagues. He had decided to go get lunch around the time the shooting happened, so he was not in the building at the time.\nWhen asked if they were putting out a paper on Friday, he said fiercely: \u201cHell, yes.\u201d\nHis colleague Joshua McKerrow, a photographer, said he was going to pick his daughter up for her birthday when he was called about the shooting. He rushed back. He had a hard time finishing sentences.\n\u201cOur newspaper is one of the oldest newspapers in the U.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a real newspaper and like every newspaper, it is a family.\u201d He began to cry. Then he added:\n\u201cWe will be here tomorrow. We are not going anywhere.\u201d", "date": "June 28, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/28/us/capital-gazette-annapolis-shooting.html", "tags": "shooting people newsroom maryland mr. gazette thursday local \u201d capital dead newspaper ramos"}
