{"title": "Trump Falsely Claims People 'Closest' To Him Weren't Tapped By Mueller To Testify", "content": "President Donald Trump falsely asserted in a Twitter post on Monday that people \u201cwho were closest to me\u201d were not called to testify as part of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election \u2015 ignoring that several key witnesses had close ties to him.\nThe Associated Press, in a fact check of Trump\u2019s claim, stated flatly, \u201cThe president is wrong on multiple counts here.\u201d\nIn his tweet, Trump said, \u201cIsn\u2019t it amazing that the people who were closest to me, by far, and knew the Campaign better than anyone, were never even called to testify before Mueller.\u201d He said the reason is that such witnesses \u201cwould all say \u2018NO COLLUSION\u2019 and only very good things!\u201d\nDuring its nearly two-year investigation, Mueller\u2019s team spoke to numerous people with close ties to Trump, his presidential campaign and his administration.\n One of those major players was Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer and longtime fixer, Michael Cohen, who became a cooperating witness and was sentenced to three years in prison on charges that included violating campaign finance laws and lying to Congress. Cohen also testified before Congress earlier this year about the inner workings of the Trump campaign, and he said Trump directed him to pay porn star Stormy Daniels $130,000 to keep quiet about their alleged affair.\nAnother key cooperating witness for the Russia probe was former White House counsel Don McGahn, who refused the president\u2019s orders to get rid of Mueller, according to Mueller\u2019s report. After a\u00a0New York Times story in January 2018 reported that several months previously Trump had pushed McGahn to fire Mueller\u2019s orders, the Mueller report disclosed that the president tried to get McGahn to deny that he had given that directive.\nMueller\u2019s team also interviewed White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders \u2015 who, according to the special counsel\u2019s report, admitting lying to the media about the reaction within the FBI to Trump\u2019s firing of FBI Director James Comey.\nOthers offering testimony in the Mueller investigation included two former White House chiefs of staff, Reince Priebus and John Kelly, and Steve Bannon, who after playing a major role in Trump\u2019s campaign briefly served as the president\u2019s chief strategist in the White House.\nMueller\u2019s report also said that Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s eldest son, \u201cdeclined to be voluntarily interviewed\u201d as part of the investigation. Trump Jr. and the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, were among the campaign officials who met in June 2016 at Trump Tower\u00a0in New York with a Russian lawyer associated with the Kremlin. Days before the meeting, Trump Jr. received a message from a music promoter telling him a senior Russian government official was offering to provide damaging information on Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. Trump Jr. responded saying, \u201cif it\u2019s what you say I love it.\u201d\nKushner, who oversees various policy issues in Trump\u2019s administration, met multiple times with Mueller\u2019s team.\nTrump\u2019s Monday tweet stands as his latest mischaracterization of the findings of the special counsel investigation. He routinely has been saying it found \u201cno collusion\u201d and \u201cno obstruction,\u201d but the latter claim is incorrect.\nThe Justice Department last week released a redacted version of Mueller\u2019s report, which said it \u201cdid not establish\u201d that the Trump campaign \u201cconspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.\u201d The report did not reach a conclusion on whether Trump obstructed justice, but it did offer details of the president\u2019s efforts to \u201cinfluence\u201d the investigation and cooperating witnesses.\nThe president did not mention in his tweet that Mueller repeatedly tried to speak with him, at one point scheduling an in-person interview early last year only to have it canceled by Trump\u2019s legal team.\nThe special counsel reportedly threatened in May 2018 to subpoena Trump if the White House refused a sit-down interview, but the Mueller report said the special counsel\u2019s team eventually concluded that the \u201csubstantial quality of information we had obtained from other sources\u201d allowed it to draw conclusions \u201con intent and credibility\u201d without such a face-to-face session.\nTrump ended up giving written answers in November to some of the special counsel\u2019s questions, reportedly only answering ones related to election interference by Russia and not ones related to whether he tried to obstruct Mueller\u2019s investigation.\nAlong with Cohen, people within Trump\u2019s circle who ended up facing charges stemming from Mueller\u2019s probe\u00a0include former campaign aide George Papadopoulos, former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn, former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, former campaign deputy Richard Gates and Trump associate Roger Stone.
