{"title": "A Mass Murder of, and for, the InternetListen to \u2018The Daily\u2019: The Mosque Attacks in New Zealand", "content": "Before entering a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand, the site of one of the deadliest mass murders in the country\u2019s history, a gunman paused to endorse a YouTube star in a video that appeared to capture the shooting.\n\u201cRemember, lads, subscribe to PewDiePie,\u201d he said.\nTo an untrained eye, this would have seemed like a bizarre detour.\nBut the people watching the video stream recognized it as something entirely different: a meme.\nLike many of the things done before the attack on Friday \u2014 like the posting of a 74-page manifesto that named a specific internet figure \u2014 the PewDiePie endorsement served two purposes. For followers of the killer\u2019s videostream, it was a kind of satirical Easter egg. \u201cSubscribe to PewDiePie,\u201d which began as a grass-roots online attempt to keep the popular YouTube entertainer from being dethroned as the site\u2019s most-followed account, has morphed into a kind of all-purpose cultural bat signal for the young and internet-absorbed.\nFor everyone else, it was a booby trap, a joke designed to ensnare unsuspecting people and members of the media into taking it too literally. The goal, if there was one, may have been to pull a popular internet figure into a fractious blame game and inflame political tensions everywhere. \nIn a tweet early Friday morning, PewDiePie, whose real name is Felix Kjellberg, said, \u201cI feel absolutely sickened having my name uttered by this person.\u201d\nNew Zealand authorities have identified an accused gunman as Brenton Harrison Tarrant, 28, but it remains unclear if he acted alone.\nThe details that have emerged about the Christchurch shooting \u2014 at least 49 were killed in an attack on two mosques \u2014 are horrifying. But a surprising thing about it is how unmistakably online the violence was, and how aware the shooter on the videostream appears to have been about how his act would be viewed and interpreted by distinct internet subcultures.\nIn some ways, it felt like a first \u2014 an internet-native mass shooting, conceived and produced entirely within the irony-soaked discourse of modern extremism.\nThe attack was teased on Twitter, announced on the online message board 8chan and broadcast live on Facebook. The footage was then replayed endlessly on YouTube, Twitter and Reddit, as the platforms scrambled to take down the clips nearly as fast as new copies popped up to replace them. In a statement on Twitter, Facebook said it had \u201cquickly removed both the shooter\u2019s Facebook and Instagram accounts and the video,\u201d and was taking down instances of praise or support for the shooting. YouTube said it was \u201cworking vigilantly to remove any violent footage\u201d of the attack. Reddit said in a statement that it was taking down \u201ccontent containing links to the video stream or manifesto.\u201d\nEven the language used to describe the attack before the fact framed it as an act of internet activism. In a post on 8chan, the shooting was referred to as a \u201creal life effort post.\u201d An image was titled \u201cscrew your optics,\u201d a reference to a line posted by the man accused in the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting that later became a kind of catchphrase among neo-Nazis. And the manifesto \u2014 a wordy mixture of white nationalist boilerplate, fascist declarations and references to obscure internet jokes \u2014 seems to have been written from the bottom of an algorithmic rabbit hole.\nIt would be unfair to blame the internet for this. Motives are complex, lives are complicated, and we don\u2019t yet know all the details about the shooting. Anti-Muslim violence is not an online phenomenon, and white nationalist hatred long predates 4Chan and Reddit.\nBut we do know that the design of internet platforms can create and reinforce extremist beliefs. Their recommendation algorithms often steer users toward edgier content, a loop that results in more time spent on the app, and more advertising revenue for the company. Their hate speech policies are weakly enforced. And their practices for removing graphic videos \u2014 like the ones that circulated on social media for hours after the Christchurch shooting, despite the companies\u2019 attempts to remove them \u2014 are inconsistent at best.\nWe also know that many recent acts of offline violence bear the internet\u2019s imprint. Robert Bowers, the man charged with killing 11 people and wounding six others at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, was a frequent user of Gab, a social media platform beloved by extremists. Cesar Sayoc, the man charged with sending explosives to prominent critics of President Trump last year, was immersed in a cesspool of right-wing Facebook and Twitter memes.\nPeople used to conceive of \u201conline extremism\u201d as distinct from the extremism that took form in the physical world. If anything, the racism and bigotry on internet message boards felt a little less dangerous than the prospect of Ku Klux Klan marches or skinhead rallies.\n[Read about the challenges of reporting on a shooting that was set up \u201cas almost an internet performance.\u201d]\nNow, online extremism is just regular extremism on steroids. There is no offline equivalent of the experience of being algorithmically nudged toward a more strident version of your existing beliefs, or having an invisible hand steer you from gaming videos to neo-Nazism. The internet is now the place where the seeds of extremism are planted and watered, where platform incentives guide creators toward the ideological poles, and where people with hateful and violent beliefs can find and feed off one another.\nSo the pattern continues. People become fluent in the culture of online extremism, they make and consume edgy memes, they cluster and harden. And once in a while, one of them erupts.\nIn the coming days, we should attempt to find meaning in the lives of the victims of the Christchurch attack, and not glorify the attention-grabbing tactics of the gunman. We should also address the specific horror of anti-Muslim violence.\nAt the same time, we need to understand and address the poisonous pipeline of extremism that has emerged over the past several years, whose ultimate effects are impossible to quantify but clearly far too big to ignore. It\u2019s not going away, and it\u2019s not particularly getting better. We will feel it for years to come.", "date": "March 15, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/technology/facebook-youtube-christchurch-shooting.html", "tags": "shooting \u2018 attack mosque internetlisten murder daily zealand \u201d online extremism mass new internet \u2014 attacks"}
