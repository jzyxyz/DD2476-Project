{"title": "Netanyahu Vows to Start Annexing West Bank, in Bid to Rally the Right", "content": "JERUSALEM \u2014 Struggling to rally right-wing voters before Tuesday\u2019s elections, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Saturday that he would start to extend Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank if given a fourth consecutive term.\nSuch a move has been ardently sought by the settler movement but resisted until now by Mr. Netanyahu, and by more moderate Israelis, as a potentially fatal blow to a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In the eyes of most of the world, it would also be a violation of international law that bars the annexation of land seized in war.\nBut Mr. Netanyahu trailed his main challenger, Benny Gantz, a former army chief of staff, in final polls of the campaign published Friday. And he has been frantically trying to mobilize conservative Israelis to vote for his Likud party rather than for other, more extremist parties whose leaders have joined his government but have often portrayed him as more of a brake on the settler movement than an accelerator.\nMr. Netanyahu was pressed in a live television interview Saturday night over why he had not already annexed settlement blocs like Maale Adumim and Gush Etzion, two large Jewish communities built on occupied territory on the outskirts of Jerusalem. He vowed to begin the effective annexation of those and other, more isolated areas under Jewish control.\n\u201cThe question you\u2019re asking is an interesting one: Will we move on now to the next stage?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the answer is, yes. We will move on to the next stage.\u201d\nAsked by his interviewer if that meant he would annex the settlement blocs, Mr. Netanyahu said yes, but that he would not stop there.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to apply sovereignty, but I don\u2019t distinguish between settlement blocs and the isolated settlement points, because from my perspective every such point of settlement is Israeli,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a responsibility as the Israeli government. I won\u2019t uproot anyone and I won\u2019t place them under Palestinian sovereignty. I\u2019ll look out for everyone.\u201d\nThe West Bank is home to about 2.8 million Palestinians and more than 400,000 Jewish settlers.\nMr. Netanyahu did not say whether he would seek to annex areas now under Palestinian control under the Oslo Accords.\nApplying sovereignty to Israeli settlements on West Bank land that the Palestinians demand for a future state, presumably along with the roads and infrastructure tethering those places to the rest of Israel, would leave the Palestinians at best with an archipelago of disconnected territory. The West Bank is now under Israeli military jurisdiction, though settlers are subject to civilian law, as Israeli citizens.\nThe chief negotiator for the Palestine Liberation Organization, Saeb Erekat, responded to Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s statements by attacking both him and the Trump administration. The White House has long promised a proposal for a \u201cdeal of the century\u201d to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nBut in the meantime, it has showered Mr. Netanyahu with priceless political gifts \u2014 from last year\u2019s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital to last month\u2019s recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights \u2014 while battering the Palestinians with aid cuts and public scoldings.\n\u201cSuch a statement by Netanyahu is not surprising,\u201d Mr. Erekat said on Twitter. \u201cIsrael will continue to brazenly violate international law for as long as the international community will continue to reward Israel with impunity, particularly with the Trump administration\u2019s support and endorsement of Israel\u2019s violation of the national and human rights of the people of Palestine.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to pursue our rights through international forums, including the international criminal court, until we achieve our long overdue justice.\u201d\nShalom Lipner, a former aide to Mr. Netanyahu and several other prime ministers, said Mr. Netanyahu might well believe the Trump administration could allow him to proceed with annexation. But he called the promise \u201cthe ultimate Hail Mary pass,\u201d and one that came with little political risk.\n\u201cThe only reason it\u2019s even credible now is because of what he\u2019s been able to coordinate with Trump,\u201d said Mr. Lipner, an analyst at the Atlantic Council. \u201cMaybe he can actually get Trump to sign off on that as well. But if it became clear it\u2019s not in the cards right now, then he can just say, \u2018Sorry, I can\u2019t swing it. Conditions change.\u2019\u201d\n[Read our guide on Israel\u2019s elections.]\nIn the television interview, Mr. Netanyahu vowed not to divide Jerusalem or \u201cuproot any settlement,\u201d and said he would \u201censure that we will control the territory west of the Jordan River,\u201d meaning the entire West Bank.\nWhen asked if he would push through before Tuesday the much-delayed evacuation of Palestinians living in Khan al-Ahmar, a Bedouin village near the Maale Adumim settlement bloc, he reiterated his opposition to a Palestinian state on the West Bank.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether it will be before the elections,\u201d he said of the Khan al-Ahmar expulsion, which set off intense international criticism after being marked for demolition to make way for an expanded Jewish settlement.\nBut, he added: \u201cWe have to control our destiny, and that is going to be impossible if we place there an independent, Arab entity \u2014 an Arab state, for all intents and purposes. A Palestinian state. That will endanger our existence.\u201d", "date": "April 6, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/06/world/middleeast/netanyahu-annex-west-bank.html", "tags": "bid annexing settlement bank \u201d rally vows west netanyahu israeli right start said"}
