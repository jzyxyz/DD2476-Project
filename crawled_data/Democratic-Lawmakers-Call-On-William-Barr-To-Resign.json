{"title": "Democratic Lawmakers Call On William Barr To Resign", "content": "Attorney General William Barr\u00a0is facing calls to resign from Democratic lawmakers who take issue with the way he publicly presented the findings of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into the 2016 election.\nThe most dramatic call came Wednesday during Barr\u2019s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) characterized the attorney general as a liar who served to protect President Donald Trump rather than to impartially analyze the Mueller report.\u00a0\n\u201cBeing attorney general of the United States is a sacred trust,\u201d Hirono said. \u201cYou have betrayed that trust; America deserves better. You should resign.\u201d\nThe previous evening, Hirono tweeted that Barr had lied to \u201cboth the House and Senate\u201d and said he \u201cshould not be the Attorney General.\u201d\nHirono is joined by fellow Democratic Judiciary Committee members\u00a0Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.),\u00a0Cory Booker (N.J.),\u00a0Kamala Harris (Calif.) and Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) in calling for Barr\u2019s resignation Wednesday.\n\u201cShe\u2019s always thought he should resign \u2014 since she didn\u2019t want him to have the job in the first place because of his expansive view of executive power,\u201d said a Klobuchar spokeswoman.\nOther Democratic senators who have also done so include Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.) \u2015 both 2020 presidential candidates, along with Harris \u2015 and Sherrod Brown (Ohio) and\u00a0Chris Van Hollen (Md.).\nAmongst the other Democratic 2020 presidential candidates, former Vice President Joe Biden and former Housing and Urban Development secretary Julian Castro have joined the resignation calls.\u00a0\nBut not all Judiciary Committee members are willing to go that far.\n\u201cI\u2019m disappointed by Mr. Barr, who\u2019s been acting more like the President\u2019s defense attorney than our Attorney General,\u201d\u00a0Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) told HuffPost in a statement. \u201cI want to hear from Robert Mueller before deciding on whether I think Mr. Barr should resign.\u201d\nSen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) said Barr\u2019s testimony was \u201can exercise in dissembling,\u201d and with it, the attorney general \u201cconfirmed that his goal is to help the President spin the facts rather than help the American people understand what happened. That\u2019s why the Committee should hear directly from Special Counsel Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein.\u201d\nAt times, Barr has seemed more like Trump\u2019s personal lawyer than the attorney general. Before he turned over the Mueller report to Congress or the public, Barr was spinning its contents as favorably to Trump as possible \u2015 including in ways that were misleading or inaccurate. He cleared Trump of obstruction of justice in the special counsel\u2019s investigation into foreign interference in the 2016 U.S. elections, even though Mueller said he couldn\u2019t reach that conclusion.\u00a0\nThe Washington Post reported Tuesday that Mueller sent a letter to Barr on March 27, taking issue with the way he was characterizing his findings.\u00a0\nBarr is supposed to testify before the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday, although he has objected to the format and structure and his participation remains up in the air.\nSome members of the House are already calling on him to step down.\n\u201cThe U.S. Attorney General must be the people\u2019s lawyer,\u201d Rep. Val Demings (D-Fla.), a committee member, said Wednesday in a statement. \u201cI gave Mr. Barr the benefit of the doubt and hoped that he would follow his oath of office. He has not done so. Mr. Barr should do the last honorable thing available to him and resign.\u201d\nA handful of House lawmakers, including Reps. David Cicilline\u00a0(D-R.I.), Diana DeGette (D-Colo.), Ted Lieu (D-Calif.), Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), Kathleen Rice (D-N.Y.) and Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) have also called for Barr\u2019s resignation.\nIgor Bobic contributed reporting.", "date": "\n05/01/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/democratic-senators-william-barr-resignation_n_5cc9e057e4b0d123954d74e5?odqp", "tags": "call judiciary committee \u201d resign democratic attorney barr general lawmakers william mueller"}
