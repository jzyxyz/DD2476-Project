{"title": "As NATO Envoys Celebrate, Signs of Fracturing From Within", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 To celebrate the 70th anniversary of NATO, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gathered ministers from all the nations in the military alliance on Wednesday night in the same hall where Harry S. Truman signed the North Atlantic Treaty Organization pact in 1949. \u201cNo military alliance in the world can remotely do what we do,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said, hailing NATO\u2019s success.\nBut the forces pulling that alliance apart were evident everywhere.\nThe bonds among the core nations that signed the original treaty, which was displayed next to Mr. Pompeo, are fracturing. New members that were once Soviet states are turning authoritarian. This week, the Pentagon blocked delivery of equipment for the alliance\u2019s most modern weapon, the F-35 fighter jet, to Turkey because the NATO nation would not back down on buying Russia\u2019s most sophisticated antiaircraft system.\nVice President Mike Pence declared at the celebration that Germany risked becoming a \u201ccaptive of Russia\u201d because of its embrace of a direct energy pipeline to Russia.\nAnd missing altogether was President Trump, whom European and American officials alike wanted to keep away from the anniversary for fear he would again raise the idea of pulling out of NATO if other member states did not pay a greater share of the defense burden.\nIt was, one European diplomat said with mild overstatement at one of the many receptions on Wednesday, a little like showing up at a birthday party and discovering you were attending a wake.\nNo one had to pick through this minefield more carefully than Jens Stoltenberg, the Norwegian diplomat currently leading the alliance. Mr. Stoltenberg deftly dealt with Mr. Trump on Tuesday by thanking him at the White House for urging NATO countries to spend more on their own defense, which is estimated to result in $100 billion in new spending by the end of 2020.\nMr. Stoltenberg clearly knew his audience. Increasing allied contributions is pretty much the only thing Mr. Trump discusses about NATO. In the president\u2019s public comments, he has seemed uninterested in what the alliance is doing to push back against Russia or to take on new threats \u2014 like the daily onslaught of cyberattacks, from the annoying to the crippling, aimed at NATO members each day.\nIt was only when Mr. Stoltenberg got to Capitol Hill, to address a joint session of Congress, that he publicly delineated what he saw as Russia\u2019s many offenses \u2014 including the annexation of Crimea, the nerve-gas attack in Britain and Moscow\u2019s violations of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, the agreement from which the United States is now withdrawing.\n\u201cNATO will always take the necessary steps to provide credible and effective deterrence,\u201d Mr. Stoltenberg said. But on Thursday, he left it unclear what form that deterrence would take. In comments to the foreign ministers from the alliance\u2019s 29 nations \u2014 up from the dozen who signed the original treaty \u2014 Mr. Stoltenberg said that even if the standoff with Russia resembled a renewed Cold War, no intermediate-range nuclear weapons would be deployed on European soil to counter Moscow\u2019s weapons.\nBut no amount of celebration or warning could paper over bitter divisions that have erupted within NATO over the past few years, only some of which have to do with Mr. Trump.\nMr. Pompeo expressed exasperation at the argument he hears so often in Europe, which is that its leaders simply will not spend money on defense at anything close to the levels Mr. Trump \u2014 and before him President Barack Obama \u2014 had in mind.\n\u201cNow is not the time to repeat tired excuses that our citizens don\u2019t support increased defense spending or security spending,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said, carefully avoiding repeating Mr. Trump\u2019s threats to leave the organization unless other member states step up.\nHe did not need to. Last year, Mr. Trump periodically told his aides that he no longer saw value in staying in the alliance. And there was a sense at the 70th anniversary this week that the damage was done \u2014 even if he did not make good on the threat.\nIn a coming report from the Council on Foreign Relations \u2014 titled \u201cTrump\u2019s Foreign Policies Are Better Than They Seem\u201d \u2014 Robert Blackwill, a former national security aide and ambassador to India in the George W. Bush administration, argued that the president\u2019s record with the alliance was mixed at best but that he had probably done more harm than good.\nIn an interview, Mr. Blackwill praised Mr. Trump for pressuring the allies to spend more and for backing up expanded NATO defenses along Russia\u2019s border with American troops and surveillance technology.\nBut he said none of that would mean much \u201cif the allies lose confidence that the U.S. will come to their defense under Article 5,\u201d the provision of the treaty that deems an attack on one to be an attack on all. Mr. Trump\u2019s biggest misstep, Mr. Blackwill said, was \u201cundermining deterrence\u201d \u2014 which he said was often as much a function of psychology as military might.\nAware of the damage already done, Mr. Pompeo repeated the American commitment to Article 5 in a brief speech to the NATO ministers on Thursday. Yet few in the hall seemed to believe him, recalling that Mr. Trump refused to mention the treaty commitment during a visit to the alliance\u2019s new headquarters in Brussels last summer, and only grudgingly did so later.\n\u201cNever before has NATO had a U.S. leader who didn\u2019t appear to believe deeply in NATO itself,\u201d R. Nicholas Burns and Douglas Lute, two former American ambassadors to the alliance, argued in an op-ed in The Washington Post.\nIn a  detailed report about the multiple crises engulfing NATO, the two former envoys pointed up a greater vulnerability that has more to do with how the alliance is focusing its resources rather than how it is raising them.\nFor years, NATO\u2019s planning and doctrine have seemed hopelessly rooted in old images of Russian military invasions into the Fulda Gap, the German lowlands where tanks could pour in. The alliance\u2019s cybercenter, north of Brussels, was focused entirely on defending its own networks that have been under constant assault for years.\nUntil a few years ago, NATO\u2019s cyberdefenses ran from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays; the idea that state-sponsored hackers might wait to attack on weekends to cripple the alliance\u2019s communications or defenses ran afoul of budgets and work schedules. Until recently, there was little discussion of offensive cybercapabilities, nor doctrines of deterrence.\nOnly now is NATO beginning to think about the vulnerabilities of civilian and military communications that rely on 5G mobile phone networks. The alliance has been slow to think about how artificial intelligence and the potential of quantum computing could change the challenge of defending member states. This week\u2019s meetings in Washington were the first in which threats from China were considered at any length.\nNext week, the NATO center of cyberexcellence in Tallinn, Estonia, will run an exercise envisioning a fictional nation \u2014 Berylia \u2014 under a combination of attacks on its power grid, its communications networks and its election systems. In the real world, that is what has happened in Ukraine, which is aspiring to join NATO. But Ukraine was not central to the discussions at the 70th anniversary.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve become blinded by the constant focus on the 2 percent standard,\u201d Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, said during the NATO meetings. He was referring to the current goal of member states of spending 2 percent of their economic output on the military by the end of 2024.\n\u201cWhat really matters is how they are spending on their defense,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. \u201cHow do we fight Russian election propaganda, or energy bribery?\u201d", "date": "April 4, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/us/politics/nato-anniversary.html", "tags": "fracturing within nato signs alliance \u201d celebrate pompeo russia said \u2014 envoys"}
