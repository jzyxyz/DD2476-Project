{"title": "Ford Plans Layoffs After -1 Billion Trump Tariff Hit", "content": "Ford Motor Company is reportedly preparing to initiate major layoffs after suffering a blow to profits of at least $1 billion due to tariffs enacted by President Donald Trump.\nThe nation\u2019s second-largest automaker hasn\u2019t yet revealed how many workers will be affected. But a report by Morgan Stanley estimated that as many as 12 percent of the company\u2019s 202,000 workers worldwide could be cut, NBC reported.\nLayoffs will center on Ford\u2019s 70,000-strong white-collar workforce as part of what the company is calling a \u201credesign\u201d of its staff in an ongoing $22.5 billion reorganization, according to NBC.\nTrump\u2019s tariffs and the retaliatory tariffs they triggered are taking a toll on the U.S. auto industry.\nFord CEO Jim Hackett told Bloomberg last month that tariffs on imported aluminum and steel alone dealt a blow to company profits.\n\u201cFrom Ford\u2019s perspective the metals tariffs took about $1 billion in profit from us,\u201d Hackett said. \u201cThe irony of which is we source most of that in the U.S. If it goes on any longer, it will do more damage.\u201d\nThe ongoing trade war is expected to continue to hurt the company\u2019s bottom line. Earlier this year, Trump said that \u201ctrade wars are good, and easy to win.\u201d\nFord announced a shift earlier this year to produce almost exclusively SUVs and trucks. Those vehicles continue to grow in popularity and are more profitable.\u00a0\nIts only passenger car will remain the popular Mustang, but production of the iconic brand could also be hurt if profits continue to fall.\nThe automaker said last month that it was ditching plans to sell its new Focus crossover vehicle in the U.S. The Ford Focus Active is manufactured in China. Because of the U.S.\u2019s new\u00a0tariffs\u00a0on imported cars,\u00a0it\u2019s no longer profitable for the company to sell it in America, officials said.\n\u201cThis is the first of potentially many vehicles that will disappear from the U.S. market\u201d due to the trade war,\u00a0Kristin Dziczek of the Ann Arbor, Michigan-based Center for Automotive Research warned.\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story described Ford as the nation\u2019s largest automaker. It\u2019s the second-largest automaker in the U.S.", "date": "\n10/08/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ford-poised-for-layoffs-after-1-billion-trade-war-hit_n_5bbbce51e4b01470d05445e5", "tags": "company profits tariff billion layoffs u.s. hit trump \u201d tariffs automaker plans ford"}
