{"title": "Hating On Obamacare Is Coming Back To Haunt This GOP Candidate For Governor", "content": "ANN ARBOR, Mich. \u2015 If you want to see just how dramatically the politics of health care have turned against Republicans, pay close attention to the governor\u2019s race here in Michigan and what Bill Schuette, the GOP nominee, is saying about his state\u2019s expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\n\u201cHealthy Michigan is the law,\u201d Schuette told David Eggert of\u00a0The Associated Press this past week, referring to Michigan\u2019s expansion by its formal name. \u201cIt\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d\nThat is quite a statement coming from Schuette, who, as Michigan\u2019s attorney general, has spent most of the last eight years\u00a0decrying\u00a0and fighting \u201cObamacare.\u201d But it also makes a lot of sense, given his current political predicament.\nApproximately 680,000 Michiganders\u00a0now have health insurance because of the Medicaid expansion, under which the state makes coverage available to all people with incomes below or just above the poverty line. And the opponent that Schuette has drawn for the general election is\u00a0Gretchen Whitmer, former Democratic leader in the state Senate. Whitmer doesn\u2019t merely support the expansion. Back in 2013, she played a pivotal role in passing it. \nWhitmer these days brings up the issue every chance she gets \u2015 in speeches, interviews and now a television ad that is running in markets across the state.\u00a0\u201cSince we expanded Medicaid in Michigan, 680,000 people can now afford to see a doctor when they need one,\u201d Whitmer says in the spot, which comes from an independent group affiliated with the Democratic Governors\u2019 Association. \u201cNow Bill Schuette says he would get rid of Medicaid expansion.\u201d\nPolls show Whitmer with a double-digit lead and, according to several recent media reports, the Republican Governor\u2019s Association has been shifting money out of the state \u2015 presumably, because Schuette\u2019s prospects of victory are looking dim.\u00a0Although there\u2019s no way to know how big a role the Medicaid expansion has played in the campaign, it says a lot that Whitmer keeps trying to talk about Schuette\u2019s record on it, while Schuette keeps trying to downplay it.\nAnd Michigan isn\u2019t the only state where that\u2019s happening. \nJust like Republicans running for Congress this year, Republicans running for governor in several key states are struggling to defend their records of trying to block, undermine and repeal the Affordable Care Act.\nBut for the gubernatorial candidates especially, it\u2019s not just a question of whether these Republicans will look out for people who have\u00a0pre-existing conditions. It\u2019s also a question of whether these candidates will protect the millions who have gotten health insurance because their states expanded Medicaid.\nThe GOP candidates, like Schuette, insist that they will. But their histories suggest those vows don\u2019t mean a whole lot.\nSchuette\u2019s record is instructive. When he first ran for attorney general in 2010, he vowed to \u201cfight Obamacare tooth and nail, day-in and day-out,\u201d taking advantage of a political environment in which the law was unpopular and a backlash to it was likely helping Republicans to win elections across the country. Since taking office, Schuette has been true to his promise, twice filing briefs in support of major lawsuits challenging its constitutionality.\nEach of those lawsuits had the potential to wipe out health coverage for hundreds of thousands of Michiganders. And in one of them, a case that became known as NFIB v. Sebelius, Schuette filed a brief that specifically attacked the law\u2019s expansion of Medicaid. \nIt was the part of the lawsuit that prevailed in the Supreme Court, and it had a significant impact.\u00a0The Affordable Care Act\u2019s architects had envisioned all states agreeing to expand Medicaid. The decision in NFIB made it a lot easier to say no, setting up big fights in states where Republicans controlled one or more branches of government.\nMichigan was one of those states. Democrats wanted the expansion and so did Rick Snyder, the Republican governor who this year is stepping down because of term limits. Snyder is a businessman who had never held elected office before running for governor. Once the Affordable Care Act became law, he figured expansion was a good deal for his state, given that the federal government would be picking up nearly all of the additional cost. \nBut Republicans in the Michigan Legislature were adamantly opposed, and so was Schuette, who argued that even the small state investment would be too big a drain on taxpayers \u2015 and that expanding Medicaid, more generally, would give government too much control over health care.\n\u201cBill Schuette has consistently opposed the expansion of Medicaid,\u201d Schuette\u2019s spokesperson said in 2013, in the middle of the legislative debate. \u201cHe believes that the federal government is not a reliable or steady funder and the long term fiscal costs of government expansion of health care is not sustainable and will result in huge costs to Michigan taxpayers.\u201d\nEven though Schuette was on the losing side of that fight, his strident opposition to the Medicaid expansion served him well, endearing him to conservative activists and financiers. It also proved useful in this year\u2019s GOP gubernatorial primary, because it provided a cudgel to use against a top rival, Brian Calley, who as Snyder\u2019s lieutenant governor had supported the expansion. \u201cCalley brought Obamacare to Michigan,\u201d one Schuette ad said.\nIn March, Schuette bragged about his opposition to the Medicaid expansion in a tweet and promised that, as governor, he would \u201cwork to repeal & replace Obamacare.\u201d As recently as last month, Michiganders were receiving\u00a0fundraising solicitations\u00a0reminding them that Schuette \u201copposed Obamacare, including the \u2018free\u2019 federal Medicaid dollars from Obama that leave Michigan taxpayers on the hook for more.\u201d\n\u201cI need your help to stop Obamacare once and for all,\u201d the mailer said.\nBut now the primary is over, which means Schuette has to appeal to voters outside the Republican base. And he has to do so in a political environment that looks different than it did in 2010. \nThe Affordable Care Act is more popular, according to polls, and voters are back to trusting Democrats more than Republicans on health care. One big reason is that last year\u2019s repeal effort in Washington convinced Americans that Republicans would take health insurance away from people who now have it \u2015 which, of course, is precisely what Whitmer keeps saying Schuette would do. \nSchuette in the AP interview\u00a0called that accusation \u201cfalse\u201d and \u201cwrong,\u201d and said \u201cit\u2019s the same old scare tactic of trying to intimidate people.\u201d But his statement that the expansion \u201cisn\u2019t going anywhere\u201d wasn\u2019t exactly a promise to leave the program alone. \nIf elected, Schuette could still call on the Legislature to stop funding the expansion.\u00a0He could also support future efforts at repeal in Washington, should Republicans hold onto both houses of Congress. Plus there are all sorts of things Schuette could do to undermine the Medicaid expansion in more subtle ways, like creating bureaucratic hurdles that would make it more difficult for people to sign up and stay on the program.\nThe same is true in some other states where Republican governors who supported Medicaid expansions are now stepping down because of term limits. Ohio, for example, owes its expansion to the advocacy of outgoing Republican governor John Kasich, who said it is a moral cause and cited calls in Scripture to help the poor and weak.\nThe Republican nominee for that seat is Mike DeWine, the state\u2019s attorney general, and he has recently pledged to leave the expansion in place, earning the endorsement of the state\u2019s medical society in the process. But DeWine has his own, very public record of opposing the health care law in general and the Medicaid expansion in particular. Just this past May, DeWine released an advertisement attacking one of his Republican primary opponents as a \u201cfake conservative\u201d because she supported \u201cObama\u2019s Medicaid expansion.\u201d\u00a0\nPolitiFact called DeWine\u2019s change of mind on the expansion a \u201cfull flop,\u201d its most extreme rating.\u00a0\nIn Nevada, Attorney General Adam Laxalt is the Republican nominee to replace outgoing GOP governor Brian Sandoval. Laxalt has pledged not to roll back the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion. But when Laxalt first ran for attorney general, he touted his opposition to the Affordable Care Act, and earlier this year he said that although he was prepared to let the expansion stay in place, he would not have signed it into law had he been governor at the time.\nIt\u2019s possible that Schuette, DeWine and Laxalt really would keep their state Medicaid expansions in place. Maybe they understand how politically strong the program has become, or maybe they recognize how vital it has become to their states\u2019 well-being, with so many hospitals depending on it for revenue and so many beneficiaries depending on it for care. Research\u00a0on the Medicaid expansion, including a brand-new University of Michigan study, has shown that it is making a big difference in people\u2019s lives.\nBut there is no way to know for sure how these Republicans would govern. And if they changed their minds about the Medicaid expansion once, there\u2019s always the possibility they will change it again \u2015 especially if their history of opposition doesn\u2019t stop them from getting elected in November.", "date": "\n09/17/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/schuette-whitmer-michigan-medicaid-expansion_n_5b9bba69e4b013b0977a04eb", "tags": "hating candidate obamacare expansion gop back medicaid \u201d coming schuette haunt state republicans governor michigan care"}
