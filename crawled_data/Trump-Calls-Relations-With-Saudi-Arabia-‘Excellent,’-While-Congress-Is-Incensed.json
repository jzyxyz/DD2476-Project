No good.\u201d But he added that relations with the kingdom were \u201cexcellent.\u201d\nThe pressure from Congress could force the White House and the State Department to change important aspects of foreign policy \u2014 including, possibly, withdrawing support for the Saudi-led campaign in Yemen\u2019s civil war. In June, a key vote on arms sales to the Saudis narrowly passed, and future munitions sales have been held up.\nOn Wednesday, the leaders of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee sent a bipartisan letter to Mr. Trump demanding an investigation of whether \u201cthe highest ranking officials in the government of Saudi Arabia\u201d were responsible for human rights abuses in Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s case.\nThe letter invoked a statute that Congress enacted in December 2016 that says the executive branch, upon receipt of such a letter, has 120 days to decide whether to sanction foreign officials.\nIt is not clear, however, whether the Trump administration will consider itself bound to comply if the president does not want to tangle with the Saudis. When President Barack Obama signed the legislation creating that law, he issued a signing statement challenging it as an unconstitutional intrusion on executive power.\nThe Trump administration was widely criticized for its relative silence on Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance until Monday, six days after he entered the Saudi Consulate. Critics said the slow reaction could embolden leaders of Saudi Arabia and other authoritarian nations to carry out human rights abuses.\nThe intense scrutiny of Saudi Arabia and its crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, may strain his close relationship with Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and top Middle East adviser. Mr. Kushner had been cultivating the prince\u2019s support for an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan, but King Salman of Saudi Arabia has rejected it.\nSome analysts have also questioned whether financial ties between Mr. Trump and Saudi businessmen compromise his policies.\n\u201cThe unanswered questions about the extent to which Trump\u2019s personal interests \u2014 as well as those of his family and associates, including Jared Kushner \u2014 have had an effect on the U.S. approach to Saudi Arabia makes the close Saudi ties all the more troubling,\u201d said Jeffrey Prescott, a senior White House director on the Middle East during the Obama administration.\nThere are indications that the operation targeting Mr. Khashoggi was at least approved by Prince Mohammed.\nAmerican intelligence agencies have collected communications intercepts of Saudi officials discussing a plan to lure Mr. Khashoggi back to Saudi Arabia and then detain him, said a former senior American official. The official added it was inconceivable that such a plan could be carried out without the approval of the crown prince.\nTurkish security officials suspect that Mr. Khashoggi was killed by a Saudi murder squad sent by the kingdom\u2019s leadership, and that his body was dismembered with a bone saw and taken out of the building. A Turkish newspaper close to the government published names of 15 suspects who are believed to have left Turkey to return to Saudi Arabia the same day on two private planes; one is a top Saudi autopsy expert and another a lieutenant in the Royal Saudi Air Force.\nSaudi leaders maintain Mr. Khashoggi left the consulate on his own.\nMr. Trump notably made Saudi Arabia a destination for his first trip abroad as president, in May 2017, during which he announced a $110 billion weapons deal with the kingdom. Not only is Mr. Trump relying on Saudi Arabia to persuade Palestinians to support a peace plan, he is also dependent on the kingdom to help contain Iranian influence in the region.\nHussein Ibish, a senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute, said rising tensions in the United States over Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance and other issues are \u201cgoing to be significant.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s no doubt that Saudi Arabia has become one of the foreign policy issues that has resonated in the domestic political context,\u201d Mr. Ibish said.\nStill, he said the United States had no option but to rely on Saudi Arabia as an ally if seeks influence in the Middle East. \u201cIt can\u2019t really project influence and force in the region without the cooperation of a major regional power,\u201d Mr. Ibish said. \u201cThere are no good options to Saudi Arabia.\u201d\nCongress has have grown increasingly angry over the conduct of the bombing campaign, which is part of a proxy war in Yemen between Saudi Arabia and Iran. An Aug. 9 airstrike that hit a school bus, killing more than 40 children, was particularly shocking \u2014 even for a war in which children have been the primary victims, suffering through one of the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crises.\nThe war in Yemen had killed more than 10,000 people before the United Nations stopped updating the death toll two years ago.\nSenator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, has held up a proposed sale by Raytheon of 60,000 laser-guided bombs to Saudi Arabia, a deal worth about $1 billion. (Mr. Menendez is also holding up a similar deal to sell the same weapons to the United Arab Emirates, Saudi\u2019s main partner in the war.\nThe case of Mr. Khashoggi \u201conly strengthens the need for the administration to answer his questions on the need to approve the proposed sales,\u201d said Juan Pachon, a spokesman for Mr. Menendez. The senator met Mr. Khashoggi on a congressional delegation trip to Saudi Arabia in 2014.\nThe Trump administration certified last month that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were doing enough to minimize the deadly consequences of their aerial campaign in Yemen.\nAhead of the certification, however, international aid groups in Yemen compiled a list of 37 instances between June and September of civilians killed or injured in coalition strikes, and provided it to American officials, according to two officials briefed on the casualty figures.\nFrustration over the Yemen war extends to Pentagon officials and American commanders. In late August, the top American air commander in the Middle East urged the Saudi-led coalition of Arab nations to be more forthcoming about an investigation into the airstrike on the school bus.\n\u201cThey need to come out and say what occurred there,\u201d the officer, Lt. Gen. Jeffrey L. Harrigian, said in an interview with The New York Times.\nA week after General Harrigian\u2019s comments were made public, the Saudi-led coalition acknowledged that the air attack was unjustified, and it pledged to hold accountable anyone who contributed to the error. But human rights groups said the Saudis have made promises before on similar errant strikes with scant results.", "date": "Oct. 11, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/11/us/politics/trump-jamal-khashoggi-turkey-saudi.html", "tags": "relations calls \u2018 khashoggi incensed \u201c officials saudi trump excellent arabia \u2014 congress"}
