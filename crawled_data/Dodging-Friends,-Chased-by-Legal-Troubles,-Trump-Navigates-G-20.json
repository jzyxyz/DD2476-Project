{"title": "Dodging Friends, Chased by Legal Troubles, Trump Navigates G-20", "content": "BUENOS AIRES \u2014 He didn\u2019t sit down with two of his favorite strongmen. He downgraded a meeting with one ally and postponed one with another. He exchanged icy smiles with the prime minister of Canada, who had threatened to skip the signing of a new trade agreement with the United States and Mexico because of lingering bitterness over steel tariffs.\nAnd President Trump was preoccupied by legal clouds back home, tweeting angrily that there was nothing illicit about his business ventures in Russia, a day after his former lawyer Michael D. Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about the extent and duration of those dealings.\nFor Mr. Trump, his first day at the summit meeting of the Group of 20 industrialized nations in Buenos Aires was a window into his idiosyncratic statecraft after nearly two years in office. His \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy has not become \u201cAmerica Alone\u201d exactly, but it has left him with a strange patchwork of partners at these global gatherings.\nMr. Trump canceled a meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, citing the country\u2019s recent naval clash with Ukraine. Nor did he meet with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, though he did exchange pleasantries with the prince, whom he has pulled close despite charges that the prince had a role in the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\nThe president did meet with the leaders of two Pacific allies, Australia and Japan, as well as with the prime minister of India. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most eager courtiers among foreign leaders, congratulated him on his \u201chistoric victory in the midterm election\u201d \u2014 an election in which Democrats seized control of the House.\nStill, in purely social terms, Mr. Trump\u2019s day may well have peaked at 7:30 a.m. when he greeted Argentina\u2019s president, Mauricio Macri, at the Casa Rosada. The pink presidential palace is famous for the balcony from which Eva Per\u00f3n once spoke to adoring crowds in the plaza below.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve known each other a long time,\u201d said Mr. Trump, who was involved in a Manhattan real estate deal with Mr. Macri\u2019s father in the 1980s. \u201cThat was in my civilian days,\u201d said a nostalgic president, who has talked recently about how much he misses his hometown.\nThe Group of 20 is a motley congregation under any circumstances, divided between liberal democratic leaders, who are greater in number, and autocrats, who often drive the agenda. Mr. Trump, who was making his second visit to the G-20, dramatizes its split nature, having alienated European allies and cultivated friendly ties with several of the strongmen.\nThis year, however, the autocrats proved as problematic as the allies. Despite professing his loyalty to Prince Mohammed only two weeks ago, Mr. Trump did not find time for a formal session with him. The president\u2019s national security adviser, John R. Bolton, chalked up the omission to Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cfull to overflowing\u201d schedule of meetings with other leaders.\nWhen the president encountered Prince Mohammed on the sidelines of the meeting, \u201cthey exchanged pleasantries,\u201d according to a White House official, as Mr. Trump did \u201cwith nearly every leader in attendance.\u201d Mr. Trump later told reporters: \u201cWe had no discussion. We might, but we had none.\u201d\nAs if to prove that the prince was not persona non grata, Saudi Arabia\u2019s Foreign Ministry posted photos of him chatting with President Emmanuel Macron of France, President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico and President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, though not Mr. Trump. He even exchanged a modified high-five with Mr. Putin before they sat down next to each other at the first session of the leaders.\nThen there was the president\u2019s frustrated bromance with Mr. Putin, one of the other mini-soap operas that flavored the meeting. After months of trying to arrange another date, Mr. Trump abruptly and unhappily pulled the plug on a scheduled meeting with Mr. Putin in Buenos Aires, citing the recent escalation in Russian tensions with Ukraine.\nThe Kremlin, which learned about the cancellation via Twitter, like the rest of the world, has been tweaking Mr. Trump in response. A Russian official told reporters that the real reason Mr. Trump canceled was the revelation that he had been trying to build a tower in Moscow much later into his presidential campaign than previously acknowledged.\nOn Friday, Mr. Trump insisted again to reporters that the meeting was scrapped \u201con the basis of what took place with respect to the ships and the sailors. That was the sole reason.\u201d Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, lamented the crossed signals. \u201cLove can\u2019t be forced,\u201d he said.\nMr. Trump is sticking to a plan to have a working dinner with President Xi Jinping of China on Saturday. And he expressed more optimism about reaching some kind of compromise with China to ease its escalating trade dispute with the United States.\n\u201cWe\u2019re working very hard,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIf we can make a deal, that\u2019d be good. I think they want to. I think we\u2019d like to.\u201d\nOn Saturday, he is to have a rescheduled meeting with Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, who arrived late on a commercial flight after an emergency landing of her government plane in Cologne.\nBut he downgraded a meeting with another ally, Mr. Moon of South Korea, to a \u201cpull aside,\u201d diplomatic jargon for a less formal encounter. The White House did not say why it had made that change, though Mr. Trump\u2019s nuclear diplomacy with North Korea has bogged down in recent weeks. The White House said Mr. Trump is still hoping for a follow-up summit meeting with President Kim Jong-un of North Korea.\nTo some experts, Mr. Trump\u2019s truncated schedule represented a new phase in his unorthodox approach to statecraft.\n\u201cIn previous meetings, Trump has been more focused on undermining the very notion of a global agenda, let alone affirming the U.S.\u2019s leadership role in defining it,\u201d said Vali R. Nasr, the dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. \u201cBut in this one, with the exception of his working dinner with Xi, he is not even doing the key bilateral meetings.\u201d\nWilliam J. Burns, who served as deputy secretary of state in the Obama administration, said Mr. Trump was dismissive of traditional diplomacy and appeared distracted by the investigation of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia.\n\u201cThe net result is not just a missed opportunity,\u201d Mr. Burns said, \u201cbut the acceleration of international disorder and the long-term weakening of American influence.\u201d\nStill, other former diplomats said the heavy focus on face-to-face meetings at these gatherings was overblown.\n\u201cThe president came to office believing that personal relations among leaders were a central part of international relations,\u201d said Elliott Abrams, who has worked for Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. \u201cI believe he has found that most foreign leaders will not allow personal likes or dislikes to affect policy, and that national policies are most often driven by history, geography and bureaucratic decision-making.\u201d\n\u201cSo,\u201d he added, \u201cmeetings at the top often become less critical.\u201d", "date": "Nov. 30, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/30/world/americas/trump-g20-putin-prince.html", "tags": "leaders friends legal troubles dodging \u201d trump meeting one prince navigates chased"}
