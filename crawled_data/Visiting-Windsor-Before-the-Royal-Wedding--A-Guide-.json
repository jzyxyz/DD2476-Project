{"title": "Visiting Windsor Before the Royal Wedding: A Guide ", "content": "You don\u2019t need an invitation to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u2019s wedding on May 19 to enjoy the ancient castle where they plan to marry, or to attend services at the Gothic chapel where they will say their vows. \nThe wedding is to take place in Windsor, west of London, about 40 minutes to an hour by train. You can figure out what works best for your schedule, including whether you want to travel by bus, at Tfl.gov.uk/plan-a-journey. Alternatively, you can drive (it\u2019s about 50 minutes to an hour by car) though you\u2019ll have to park in town as there\u2019s no visitor parking at the castle. Tour companies also offer trips to Windsor from London (see below).\nThe ceremony will be held in St. George\u2019s Chapel on the grounds of Windsor Castle \u2014 built more than 900 years ago, it is the oldest occupied castle in the world \u2014 and the place where the queen spends most of her weekends. \nServices at the chapel are free and open to anyone. If, however, you want to visit the chapel (and not attend services), you must buy a ticket at the Windsor Castle admissions office (2018 prices are \u00a321.20 for adults, or about $28.30; \u00a319.30 for students with ID and those over 60; \u00a312:30 for disabled visitors and children under 17; free for children under 5; \u00a354.70 for a family of two adults and three children under 17; prices are reduced when the State Apartments are closed). (Note that you cannot take photographs inside St. George\u2019s Chapel.) Also keep in mind that Windsor is a working castle, so expect airport-style security. You can view the rules and hours at Royalcollection.org.uk/visit/windsorcastle.\nPrince Harry is hardly the first royal to marry in the chapel, which dates to the 15th century. There have been more than a dozen royal weddings there, including that of Prince of Wales (later Edward VII) and Princess Alexandra of Denmark more than 150 years ago, in 1863. In 2005 the chapel was the site of a service of prayer and dedication after the marriage of the Prince of Wales (Prince Harry\u2019s father) and Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall. One of Prince Harry\u2019s uncles, as well as the Prince\u2019s cousin, were also married at St. George\u2019s Chapel, in 1999 and 2008, respectively.\nWhile the chapel is on the grounds of Windsor Castle, the Queen attends services at St. George\u2019s only for certain celebrations and occasions, like an annual Easter morning service.\nAfter Prince Harry and Meghan Markle announced their wedding date, news reports said hotel rooms were being snapped up in and around Windsor for the occasion. The Evening Standard reported that \u201crooms everywhere from budget inns to luxury hotels saw royalist tourists purchasing whatever was on offer.\u201d This time of year you can find availability and reasonable rates for favorite area hotels and inns, like the Sir Christopher Wren and the Winning Post. \nThough it\u2019s not necessary to stay overnight \u2014 a day trip from London is more than enough time to see the sights in Windsor; even half a day can make for a nice visit. Windsor is the sort of destination ideal for a day tour from London, which will also streamline the admission process. If you want to visit the chapel, just be sure that any tour you take allows for that and isn\u2019t scheduled for a Sunday, when the chapel is closed to visitors with the exception of those attending services. \nCompanies like Golden Tours offer day trips that include a visit to the chapel. You can also book a trip through London\u2019s tourism website, VisitLondon.com, which has tours to Windsor Castle, including St. George\u2019s Chapel and Queen Mary\u2019s Dolls\u2019 House, built in the 1920s and complete with a teeny tiny library, stocked wine cellar and working elevators.\nNearby, in the Home Park of Windsor Castle, is the more than 300-year-old Frogmore House, a royal retreat that was the home of Queen Victoria\u2019s mother, the Duchess of Kent, for nearly 20 years \u2014 though it\u2019s open to visitors for only a few days in the spring. (Groups of 15 or more that book in advance may also visit in August.) More information is at Royalcollection.org.uk/visit/frogmorehouse. \nLess exclusive is Legoland Windsor Resort, a theme park \u2014 Lego royals included \u2014 about an eight-to-10-minute drive from Windsor Castle. (If you really want to immerse yourself, there\u2019s the Legoland Castle Hotel with \u201cknights\u201d and \u201cwizard\u201d theme rooms, and the Legoland Windsor Resort Hotel.)\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle will live at Nottingham Cottage, according to a statement from Clarence House. The Cottage, where they became engaged, and where Prince William and Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, lived when they were first married, is on the grounds of Kensington Palace in London. Parts of the palace, such as the gardens and the King's State Apartments, are open to the public (online ticket prices are \u00a315.50 for adults; \u00a312.30 for full-time students and people over 60; free for children ages 5 to 15 and for members). A popular exhibition currently on view \u2014 \u201cDiana: Her Fashion Story,\u201d about the evolution of the princess\u2019s style \u2014 is making it tougher than usual to get in. But you can book available dates in advance online at Hrp.org.uk/kensington-palace, or try your luck by joining the walk-up queue for tickets at the door (which generally cost slightly more than online).  \nDie-hard royal watcher? You could take a trip further afield to the place where, weeks after Prince Harry and Meghan Markle met, the prince said they went camping under the stars: Botswana. Geoffrey Kent, a founder of the travel company Abercrombie & Kent, said in a news release that he took Prince Harry on his first safari to Botswana when he was 13 (the company still offers tours there). \nBut then, getting married in St. George\u2019s Chapel is also a homecoming of sorts for Prince Harry: He was baptized there in 1984.", "date": "Dec. 29, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/29/travel/harry-meaghan-royal-wedding-guide.html", "tags": "also st. wedding george visiting windsor royal guide london prince chapel castle \u2014 harry"}
