{"title": "Judge Blocks Mississippi Law Banning Abortions After 15 Weeks", "content": "ATLANTA \u2014 In an often-biting opinion, a federal judge on Tuesday blocked a Mississippi law that sought to forbid most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy.\nJudge Carlton W. Reeves of Federal District Court in Jackson, the Mississippi capital, wrote that the law \u201cdisregards\u201d the 14th Amendment\u2019s promise of due process and defied the United States Supreme Court\u2019s existing precedents on abortion rights.\n\u201cThe state chose to pass a law it knew was unconstitutional to endorse a decades-long campaign, fueled by national interest groups, to ask the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade,\u201d the judge wrote. \u201cThis court follows the commands of the Supreme Court and the dictates of the United States Constitution, rather than the disingenuous calculations of the Mississippi Legislature.\u201d\nHe added, in a footnote, that the Legislature\u2019s \u201cprofessed interest in \u2018women\u2019s health\u2019 is pure gaslighting\u201d and that Mississippi officials challenge abortion rights but \u201cchoose not to lift a finger to address the tragedies lurking on the other side of the delivery room: our alarming infant and maternal mortality rates.\u201d\nJudge Reeves, who cited evidence that viability begins at between 23 and 24 weeks, issued his decision about eight months after the Republican-dominated Mississippi state government enacted the law, which banned abortions if \u201cthe probable gestational age of the unborn human\u201d was determined to be more than 15 weeks. The statute included narrow exceptions for medical emergencies or \u201ca severe fetal abnormality.\u201d\nThe law drew a same-day court challenge by the Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, the state\u2019s only provider of abortion services, and Judge Reeves responded almost as quickly with an order that barred the law from being enforced. It was not until Tuesday, though, that he issued a permanent injunction and described the law as \u201ca facially unconstitutional ban on abortions prior to viability.\u201d\nBut Judge Reeves, who was appointed to the bench by President Barack Obama, said the law may have been the foundation of a \u201cdeliberate effort\u201d by Mississippi politicians to overturn Roe v. Wade, which recognized a nationwide right to an abortion.\n\u201cWith the recent changes in the membership of the Supreme Court, it may be that the state believes divine providence covered the Capitol when it passed this legislation,\u201d Judge Reeves wrote. \u201cTime will tell. If overturning Roe is the state\u2019s desired result, the state will have to seek that relief from a higher court. For now, the United States Supreme Court has spoken.\u201d\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, among the nation\u2019s most conservative appellate benches, would consider an appeal by the state.\nThe Mississippi attorney general\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment. In a statement on Wednesday, a spokesman for Gov. Phil Bryant said the governor was \u201cdisappointed in Tuesday\u2019s ruling against a law that protects both mother and child.\u201d\n\u201cHe fully supports the defense of this law moving forward,\u201d the spokesman, Knox Graham, said in an email.\nCritics of the law regarded Judge Reeves\u2019s decision as a warning to other states that might consider similar legislation.\n\u201cToday\u2019s decision should be a wake-up call for state lawmakers who are continuously trying to chip away at abortion access,\u201d said Nancy Northup, the president and chief executive of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which was involved in the Mississippi litigation. \u201cSuch bans will not stand in a court of law.\u201d", "date": "Nov. 20, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/20/us/mississippi-abortion-law.html", "tags": "blocks abortions weeks judge court states \u201d supreme reeves state mississippi banning law"}
