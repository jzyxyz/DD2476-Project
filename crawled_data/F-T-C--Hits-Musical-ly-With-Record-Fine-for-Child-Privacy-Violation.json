{"title": "F.T.C. Hits Musical.ly With Record Fine for Child Privacy Violation", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday announced a $5.7 million settlement with Musical.ly, a popular video social network now known as TikTok, over accusations that the company\u2019s app illegally collected personal information about children.\nThe F.T.C. said it was a record fine for a child privacy violation. The agency found a large percentage of the app\u2019s users were under 13 and revealed sensitive personal information including their email addresses, names and schools. The F.T.C. said the app did not ask for a parent\u2019s permission to collect data on users. When asked by some parents to delete videos and other data, the site refused.\nUnder the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act, online services need parents\u2019 permission before collecting personal data of users under 13.\n\u201cThis record penalty should be a reminder to all online services and websites that target children: We take enforcement of Coppa very seriously, and we will not tolerate companies that flagrantly ignore the law,\u201d said Joseph J. Simons, the agency\u2019s chairman.\nThe agency has come under increasing pressure to strengthen enforcement of children\u2019s online privacy. Last week, more than a dozen children\u2019s advocacy groups called on the F.T.C. to investigate Facebook after reports surfaced that the company had knowingly deceived children into racking up fees from games on its social network.\nByteDance, a Chinese internet conglomerate, bought Musical.ly in 2017. The new owner then merged Musical.ly with TikTok, an app it already operated. The app allows users to create short video clips and share them with other users. The Musical.ly version had 65 million users in the United States as of 2014, the F.T.C. said, and the TikTok app remains a big hit today.\nThe investigation was prompted by various news reports and a complaint by the Better Business Bureau. The F.T.C. said that even in a casual review of the app, it found a large portion of the users were under 13 and that it found numerous cases where parents were not notified or asked for permission.\nUser accounts were public by default and adults were able to contact users, regardless of their age. Until 2016, the app allowed users to view other users within a 50-mile radius, the F.T.C. said.\nWhen some parents asked to have the data of their children deleted, TikTok deleted a child\u2019s account but retained videos and personal account information about those users on its servers, the agency said.\nIn response to the F.T.C. action, TikTok on Wednesday announced a separate app for people under 13. The new app will not permit the sharing of personal information and puts limits on what content can be posted and shared, the company said.\n\u201cWhile we\u2019ve always seen TikTok as a place for everyone, we understand the concerns that arise around younger users,\u201d the company said. \u201cIn working with the F.T.C. and in conjunction with today\u2019s agreement, we\u2019ve now implemented changes to accommodate younger U.S. users in a limited, separate app experience that introduces additional safety and privacy protections designed specifically for this audience.\u201d", "date": "Feb. 27, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/technology/ftc-tiktok-child-privacy-fine.html", "tags": "users company tiktok fine personal record app musical.ly child children hits information f.t.c privacy violation"}
