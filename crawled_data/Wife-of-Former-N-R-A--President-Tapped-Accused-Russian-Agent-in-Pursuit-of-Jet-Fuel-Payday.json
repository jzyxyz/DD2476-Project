President Tapped Accused Russian Agent in Pursuit of Jet Fuel Payday", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 For the young Russian gun rights activist studying in the United States, it would have been an unimaginably rich payday: $1 million to help broker the sale of Russian jet fuel to an American middleman. All she had to do was secure the fuel.\nSo the activist, Maria Butina, whom American prosecutors now accuse of being a covert Russian agent, reached out to contacts in her homeland \u2014 and turned on the charm. In a July 2017 email, she told one man that his passport photo was \u201ca handsome one.\u201d\nThe following month, she told another Russian contact that she had labeled him in her phone as \u201cthe lovely Shakhov.\u201d Every time he called, she was notified that \u201c\u2018the lovely Shakov is calling you,\u2019\u201d Ms. Butina wrote. \u201cGood feelings.\u201d\nA year later, Ms. Butina, 29, is in a jail cell outside Washington, awaiting trial. Federal prosecutors have depicted her as a character out of \u201cRed Sparrow,\u201d the spy thriller about a Russian femme fatale. Ms. Butina, supported by Russian intelligence, managed to infiltrate conservative groups and advance Moscow\u2019s interests in the United States, prosecutors say.\nIn their telling, she used gun rights \u2014 Ms. Butina had started a pro-gun group in Russia \u2014 to gain a toehold in American conservative circles, and then struck up a romance with a far older Republican operative to open doors further. She has denied the allegations.\nMs. Butina\u2019s efforts to deal in Russian jet fuel, detailed in hundreds of pages of previously unreported emails, were notable not just for their whiff of foreign intrigue but for whom they involved: David Keene, a former president of the National Rifle Association and a prominent leader of the conservative movement, who has advised Republican candidates from Ronald Reagan to Mitt Romney. They also involved Mr. Keene\u2019s wife, Donna, a well-connected Washington lobbyist, and Ms. Butina\u2019s boyfriend, Paul Erickson, who ran Patrick J. Buchanan\u2019s 1992 presidential campaign and who moved in rarefied conservative circles despite allegations of fraud in three states.\nTheir attempt to secure the fuel deal illustrates a reality that investigators have had to navigate in bringing a federal case against Ms. Butina. During her time in the United States, she surrounded herself not only with high-profile American conservatives but also with dubious characters who seemed bent on making a fast buck \u2014 and it was not always easy to tell one from the other.\nIn the emails, and in interviews with people involved in the fuel negotiations, Ms. Butina seems as na\u00efve as she is cunning. She had no experience in the oil business, yet jumped into a scheme that hinged entirely on her securing a supply of huge amounts of jet fuel \u2014 nearly double what all of Russia\u2019s refineries export in a month.\nThe driving force behind the jet fuel negotiations appears to have been Mr. Erickson, 56, a former board member of the American Conservative Union who was accused of defrauding investors in California, South Dakota and Virginia. The other major players were the Keenes, who first raised the idea of brokering a sale of Russian jet fuel and then put Ms. Butina and Mr. Erickson in touch with prospective buyers.\nThe dealings also involved a pair of Pakistani-American businessmen, an Israeli-American salesman for a Virginia-based lawn care and sprinkler equipment company and a purported international fuel broker with no record of successful deals. Mr. Erickson described this person in an email as a \u201ctough, crotchety, sixty-ish divorcee who has spent his life in various energy transactions but now seems intent on using his small wealth to pursue age-appropriate women of a certain flair.\u201d\nRussia has used oil and gas deals  to build influence, deploying companies like Gazprom to cut sweetheart deals for pro-Moscow politicians in other countries. But Ms. Butina did not connect with the likes of Gazprom or other major Russian oil companies. Instead, she relied on a Russian coffee bean trader and a public relations consultant with loose ties to the political party of President Vladimir V. Putin.\nAll of them seemed out of their depth, each projecting confidence and deep knowledge of the jet fuel business while seeming not to grasp the basics. None appeared to have any idea how to pull off the deal they were negotiating \u2014 or the money with which to do it.\nIt did not take an expert to spot serious flaws in the plan.\n\u201cI knew they didn\u2019t have any clue, because there\u2019s no port in the world that could hold the amount of oil they were saying they could sell,\u201d said Yoni Wiss, the Israeli-American who briefly met with Ms. Butina and Mr. Erickson in June 2017.\nLater that summer, Mr. Erickson seemed to acknowledge the absurdity of it all. \u201cIt might be a novel someday,\u201d he wrote to Ms. Keene, the wife of the former N.R.A. president.\nYet he also acted bullish about their prospects. Ms. Butina \u201chas now created a Russian supply side juggernaut that is searching for a buyer,\u201d Mr. Erickson added, assuring Ms. Keene that she and her husband would get a cut of any deal that went forward.\nMr. Erickson did not respond to requests for comment. Neither did the Keenes.\nMs. Butina\u2019s lawyer, Robert Driscoll, said the fuel deal was \u201cjust further evidence that she wasn\u2019t here on any mission on behalf of the Russian Federation. She was essentially operating on her own account.\u201d\nBefore she waded into the fuel trade, Ms. Butina had made a minor splash among American conservatives as an ebullient graduate student at American University with a knack for meeting influential Republicans. She snapped photos with Donald Trump Jr., befriended Grover Norquist, the anti-tax crusader, and accompanied J.D. Gordon, a Trump campaign aide, to see the band Styx. To support herself in the United States, she relied in part on a Rockefeller heir, George O\u2019Neill Jr., who has used his wealth to advocate better relations with Russia.\nGovernment officials have said the charges against Ms. Butina stemmed from a counterintelligence investigation predating the 2016 election. The investigation has in part focused on a Russian official, Aleksandr P. Torshin, who worked closely with Ms. Butina for years. Mr. Torshin, a politician close to Christian conservatives in Russia, has been attending N.R.A. conventions in the United States since 2011.\nMs. Butina worked as an unpaid assistant for Mr. Torshin in Russia. Through him, she met Mr. Erickson, who twice visited Moscow, and leading members of the N.R.A., including the Keenes.\nIn March 2017, emails show, the couple met a man in Virginia who said he was seeking five million barrels of jet fuel. He offered to pay a finder\u2019s fee of $1 million if they connected him with a Russian refinery.\nIn a series of terse, businesslike emails, Ms. Keene enlisted Ms. Butina\u2019s help. On April 15, 2017, she pressed the young Russian to secure a \u201csoft corporate offer\u201d from Gazprom for the fuel. \u201cI will NOT reveal the source at this point,\u201d Ms. Keene wrote.\nInstead, Ms. Butina responded that she could cobble together needed fuel from a number of smaller refineries. She also pushed for a payment of $25,000 as a \u201cgood faith gesture\u201d for potential suppliers.\nShe did not come up with the idea on her own. Emails show that Mr. Erickson was coaching Ms. Butina through nearly every step, drafting long responses that Ms. Butina would copy and paste before sending them to Ms. Keene as her own.\nThe insistence on an upfront payment appears to have killed the first deal by April. But less than two months later, Ms. Keene was in touch again, this time offering up a contact with a jet fuel broker in Arlington, Va., named Roger Pol \u2014 whom Mr. Erickson would later describe as \u201ccrotchety.\u201d\n\u201cA LOT of people waste a LOT of time on unexclusive deals, I am not into \u2018getting to know\u2019 people to broaden my Rolodex,\u201d Ms. Keene cautioned, \u201cbut this sounds worth pursuing.\u201d\nShe arranged for Mr. Erickson and Ms. Butina to meet Mr. Pol at a restaurant outside Washington in late June and then apparently bowed out of the deal. Mr. Wiss, the Israeli-American who knew Mr. Pol, and another associate joined them.\n\u201cAfter five minutes, I said: \u2018I\u2019m done. They don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about,\u2019\u201d Mr. Wiss recalled. \u201cIt just didn\u2019t smell right.\u201d\nMr. Pol pressed on, but he soon proved to be a source of frustration for Mr. Erickson, who complained in an email that \u201che seems to lack any operating history in his own name or that of a company he controls.\u201d\nAs the deal with Mr. Pol was unraveling, Ms. Butina was still working her contacts in Russia \u2014 Sergei V. Shakhov, a public relations consultant and fellow gun rights activist, and Aleksandr Y. Nevmitulin, a coffee bean trader who said he had previously worked in the oil and gas industry.\nIn the emails to the Russians, Ms. Butina takes on a central role, keeping the identities of the Russians and the Americans secret from one another until they signed a nondisclosure agreement and a separate agreement to work exclusively through her.\n\u201cI keep the details of all sides,\u201d she wrote.\nIt was all for naught. Soon it became clear that Mr. Pol, who died of heart problems in February, could not prove that he had ever successfully brokered a fuel deal. Ms. Butina and Mr. Erickson went looking elsewhere.\nThey had at least one more meeting in mid-August with another set of potential partners. Again, it was Ms. Keene who used her Washington contacts to make the connection.\nBut a person familiar with the meeting said the potential partners feared it was some kind of scam. Instead of dealing with the couple, they reported them to the F.B.I., which by then was already tracking Ms. Butina\u2019s dealings in the United States.", "date": "Sept. 2, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/02/us/politics/maria-butina-russian-spy.html", "tags": "agent jet keene \u201c payday butina russian president fuel former accused n.r.a erickson pursuit tapped ms. \u2014 wife"}
