{"title": "'Game Of Thrones' Actor Iain Glen Shoots Down 'Evil Dany' Theory", "content": "The mother (of Dragons) of all \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d theories may not be such a sure thing, according to Jorah Mormont\u00a0actor Iain Glen.\nDespite Daenerys Targaryen\u00a0(Emilia Clarke) seeming like she\u2019s the one to root for on \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d (she did give us dragons after all), a popular theory has come up saying Dany may actually become a villain.\n(Dun, dun, dun ...)\nSupporters point out that her father, the Mad King Aerys Targaryen, also had a penchant for burning people alive, Dany is bringing the murderous Dothraki to Westeros, and she\u2019s becoming colder as time goes on.\nEven the Mother of Dragons seems to notice a change. After saying goodbye to Daario Naharis (Michiel Huisman)\u00a0in the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d Season 6 finale, she told Tyrion (Peter Dinklage), \u201cDo you know what frightens me? I said farewell to a man who loves me, a man I thought I cared for, and I felt nothing.\u201d\nDamn, Dany! Chills.\nBut supporters of this\u00a0\u201cMad Queen\u201d theory shouldn\u2019t go counting their dragon eggs before they\u2019re hatched. During an interview with HuffPost, Glen\u00a0said he thinks the idea is \u201chighly unlikely.\u201d\nGlen first stated that only showrunners Dan Weiss and David Benioff know for sure how the story will end up, saying, \u201cFrom my point of view, from Jorah\u2019s point of view,\u00a0I mean, the great thing about Dan and David is none of us have a clue of where this is going. We have a sense that things are moving toward their end game, but no one knows.\u201d\nDespite that, Glen shot down the idea that Dany would become a villain.\n\u201cI think that would be highly unlikely,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, this is Iain speaking and Jorah speaking \u2015 we share the same voice \u2015 my belief in her is such that I can\u2019t see her going that way myself, so I think that\u2019s highly unlikely. It becomes academic whether I would stand by her or not because I don\u2019t believe that would happen.\u201d\nWe should have expected this from the guy who plays Jorah Mormont. Like a true King of the Friendzone, he is standing by his queen. We\u2019re hopeful Dany won\u2019t end up burning him on this. (With dragons, that can tend to happen.)", "date": "\n07/08/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/game-of-thrones-actor-shoots-down-popular-evil-daenerys-theory_n_596118e6e4b0d5b458eacb84", "tags": "glen shoots game saying actor \u201d jorah theory thrones dany iain dragons"}
