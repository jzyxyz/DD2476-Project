{"title": "Another Mass Shooting, but This Time House Democrats Promise Action", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Since the collapse of bipartisan gun control legislation in 2013, a succession of gruesome mass shootings has been greeted on Capitol Hill by thoughts, prayers and then inaction. But the killing of 12 people late Wednesday night at a California country and western bar came just 24 hours after Democrats \u2014 many of whom campaigned in support of gun control \u2014 regained the House majority in the midterm elections.\nThis time, Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House Democrats\u2019 longtime leader, has promised a legislative response when her party takes control in January.\n\u201cI do believe\u201d there will be action, Ms. Pelosi said in an interview on Thursday on CNN, \u201cbecause in this Congress, the one that we\u2019re in right this minute, there is bipartisan legislation to have common sense background checks, to prevent guns going into the wrong hands.\u201d\nThe likely first push will be a version of the bill written after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012 \u2014 subjecting almost all gun sales to a federal background check, including internet and gun show transactions. Newly elected representatives will descend on Washington next week for freshman orientation, mingling with veteran lawmakers and kicking off the legislative discussions.\n\u201cWe want the new members to be a part of this conversation,\u201d said Drew Hammill, a spokesman for Ms. Pelosi.\nA legislative lunge toward gun control in the inaugural months of the 116th Congress would offer up the first test for the new Democratic majority. The Republican majority in the Senate, fortified on Tuesday with new conservative hard-liners, has balked at any legislation that can be painted as curbing gun owners\u2019 rights. After a gunman opened fire on Republican lawmakers last year at a suburban baseball field, Republicans actually pressed to loosen gun controls.\nAnd Democrats could face their own divisions. A number of victorious Democrats campaigned on reducing gun violence and strengthening gun laws, including Lucy McBath of Georgia, whose son was killed in a 2012 shooting; Jason Crow, from the suburbs of Denver, who made rallying cries of the mass shootings at Columbine High School and an Aurora, Colo., movie theater; and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, a former C.I.A. officer who supports a ban on certain firearms with military-style features.\n\u201cI hope that we take swift action and do it fairly soon to enact sensible gun law reform that will keep communities safe,\u201d said Veronica Escobar, who will succeed Beto O\u2019Rourke as the representative from El Paso, Texas. \u201cI\u2019m so tired of being heartbroken \u2014 so tired of feeling worry and concern for my children and family. It\u2019s about time we do something about it.\u201d\n\u201cIf the president or the Senate chooses not to support it, frankly, it\u2019s on them,\u201d she added, \u201cbut we have to try and we have to continue to try until we get it done.\u201d\nGun safety marches and a new breed of advocates \u2014 most prominently, March for Our Lives, the movement led by the teenage survivors of the shooting at a high school in Parkland, Fla., \u2014 bolstered young voter turnout. Around two dozen candidates supported by the gun lobby were defeated on Tuesday, according to Giffords PAC, the gun safety group run by former Representative Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot in the head in a mass shooting.\n\u201cWe cannot let these tragedies become our new normal,\u201d said Colin Allred, an incoming freshman Democrat who ousted a veteran Republican, Pete Sessions, in the suburbs north of Dallas. \u201cI think we need to find a way to work together to find some real solutions to reduce gun violence, consistent with the Second Amendment.\u201d\nBut a handful of other Democrats, including Representative Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania, a former Marine who favors gun rights, have cautioned the party against any legislative package that would curtail gun owners\u2019 ability to obtain firearms. And winning Democrats in districts like suburban Charleston, S.C., and Oklahoma City will have to be mindful of their fragile mandates \u2014 especially if any House legislation is destined to die in the Republican-controlled Senate or at President Trump\u2019s desk.\nSome incoming freshmen are warning against overpromising or politicizing a tragedy.\n\u201cAs Democrats, we should not try to make this a political issue that is about gun legislation because any of the gun legislation we\u2019re advocating for would not have prevented this,\u201d said Katie Hill, who defeated Representative Steve Knight in a California district near Wednesday\u2019s shooting. \u201cWe lose credibility if we try to make it as if it would\u2019ve,\u201d she added.\nThe gunman, a former Marine, bought his handgun legally in a state with some of the toughest gun control laws in the country.\nThat could limit Democratic leaders\u2019 ambitions. Joe Cunningham, the Democratic representative-elect for South Carolina\u2019s First District, said he would endorse a bill banning so-called bump stocks, which allow semiautomatic rifles to fire like automatic weapons, and strengthening background checks.\n\u201cI think some of these things can be accomplished without infringing on the Second Amendment,\u201d said Mr. Cunningham, a gun owner with a concealed carry permit.\nOther incoming freshmen said Congress could not be timid. Tom Malinowski, an incoming freshman Democrat from New Jersey, noted the longstanding bipartisan support to expand background checks.\n\u201cKeep in mind that even in the Republican House of Representatives, there was a working majority to pass at least universal background checks,\u201d Mr. Malinowski said. \u201cThe only reason it didn\u2019t happen is the leadership was too terrified to allow a vote. The new leadership obviously won\u2019t be.\u201d\nMs. Pelosi, who remains confident that she will reclaim the speaker\u2019s gavel next year, said on Thursday that public support would serve as an impetus for moderate Republicans to endorse background check legislation.\n\u201cI do believe that our strength is in the public involvement,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said on Thursday.\nAccording to Gallup, 61 percent of Americans want stricter gun laws, and there is even more support for universal background checks and red-flag laws, which allow a judge to issue an order that enables law enforcement officers to confiscate guns from individuals deemed a risk to themselves or others. Such initiatives could garner support from more moderate Republicans and their counterparts in the Senate.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to find issues where you can find 50 or 60 percent saying, \u2018yeah, this is a good idea,\u2019\u201d Kris Brown, co-president of the Brady Campaign and Center to Prevent Gun Violence, said of the background check expansion, pointing to a Quinnipiac University National Poll after the Parkland shooting, which found that 97 percent of American voters supported universal background checks.\n\u201cMore people would say they have a problem with apple pie,\u201d she said.", "date": "Nov. 9, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/09/us/politics/gun-control-california-shooting.html", "tags": "shooting promise democrats background legislation gun house \u201d another mass new time \u2014 action"}
