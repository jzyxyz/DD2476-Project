{"title": "Pentagon Officials Fear Bolton\u2019s Actions Increase Risk of Clash With Iran", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Senior Pentagon officials are voicing deepening fears that President Trump\u2019s hawkish national security adviser, John R. Bolton, could precipitate a conflict with Iran at a time when Mr. Trump is losing leverage in the Middle East by pulling out American troops.\nAt Mr. Bolton\u2019s direction, the National Security Council asked the Pentagon last year to provide the White House with military options to strike Iran, Defense Department and senior American officials said on Sunday.\nThe request, which alarmed then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and other Pentagon officials, came after Iranian-backed militants fired three mortars or rockets into an empty lot on the grounds of the United States Embassy in Baghdad in September.\nIn response to Mr. Bolton\u2019s request, which The Wall Street Journal first reported, the Pentagon offered some general options, including a cross-border airstrike on an Iranian military facility that would have been mostly symbolic. But Mr. Mattis and other military leaders adamantly opposed retaliating, arguing that the attack was insignificant \u2014 a position that ultimately won out, these officials said.\nSuch a strike could have caused an armed conflict and could have prompted Iraq to order the United States to leave the country, said a senior American official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal policy deliberations.\nSince Mr. Bolton took over from H.R. McMaster in April, he has intensified the administration\u2019s policy of isolating and pressuring Iran \u2014 reflecting an animus against Iran\u2019s leaders that dates back to his days as an official in the George W. Bush administration. As a private citizen, he later called for military strikes on Iran, as well as regime change.\nMr. Bolton has made headway on some issues, like persuading Mr. Trump to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, but has had less success with others, like maintaining an American military presence in northeastern Syria to counter Iranian influence \u2014 something Mr. Bolton vowed to do only weeks before the president announced in December that he was pulling out.\nIn asking for military options, a senior administration official said, Mr. Bolton was merely doing his job as national security adviser. He pointed out that the Iranian-backed militants also targeted the American Consulate in Basra.\n\u201cThe N.S.C. coordinates policy and provides the president with options to anticipate and respond to a variety of threats,\u201d said a spokesman for the National Security Council, Garrett Marquis.\nMr. Bolton, 70, is not the only Iran hawk in Mr. Trump\u2019s circle of top advisers. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared in a speech at the American University in Cairo last week that \u201ccountries increasingly understand that we must confront the ayatollahs, not coddle them.\u201d\nEarlier this month, he warned Iran against launching three spacecraft, describing them as a pretext for testing missile technology that is necessary to carry a warhead to the United States and other nations. His statement appeared aimed at building a legal case for diplomatic, military or covert action against the Iranian missile program.\nIt was surprising because Iran has used these modest space missions, mostly to deploy satellites, since 2005. The senior American official said that the Pentagon and the intelligence agencies disagreed with Mr. Pompeo\u2019s interpretation of the threat posed by the satellite launches.\nSpeaking on Sunday on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d during a visit to Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates, Mr. Pompeo discounted the argument that Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw 2,000 American troops from Syria in the coming months undercuts Washington\u2019s ability to achieve its other goals in the region.\n\u201cThat certainly includes in Syria,\u201d he said. \u201cIt certainly includes into Iran, if need be.\u201d\nBut Mr. Pompeo also opposed the idea of an airstrike on Iran after its attack on the embassy, according to a former senior administration official. On Sunday, he declined to comment about The Journal\u2019s report. On each stop of his Middle East trip, Mr. Pompeo, a former Army officer, has spoken of the need to counter Iran, but has not talked of military action.\nWhen Mr. McMaster, then a three-star Army general, took over as national security adviser in early 2017, he ordered a new overall war plan for Iran. Mr. Mattis, who is himself an Iran hawk from his days as a Marine Corps commander in the region, delivered options. But those plans were not for the kind of pinpoint strikes that Mr. Bolton envisioned after the attack on the American Embassy on Sept. 6.\nOn the Sunday following the attack, the senior American official said, Mr. Bolton\u2019s deputy at the time, Mira Ricardel, convened an emergency meeting of national security aides to Mr. Trump, called a deputies committee meeting, and asked for retaliatory options.\nOn Sept. 11, the White House said in a statement, \u201cThe United States will hold the regime in Tehran accountable for any attack that results in injury to our personnel or damage to United States government facilities. America will respond swiftly and decisively in defense of American lives.\u201d\nWhat happened next illustrates Mr. Bolton\u2019s management style. As the president\u2019s national security adviser, he has largely eliminated the internal policy debates that could air high-level disagreements.\nMr. Bolton does not want to hear opposing views, these officials said, abhors leaks and wants to control everything that flows to the president. But the result is that there is not much consideration of options and, more important, the risk of escalation, according to these people.\nThe Pentagon declined to comment on Mr. Bolton\u2019s request for military options, saying in a statement, \u201cThe Department of Defense is a planning organization and provides the president military options for a variety of threats; routinely reviewing and updating plans and activities to deal with a host of threats, including those posed by Iran, to deter and, if necessary, to respond to aggression.\u201d\nA senior administration official said the United States would continue to pursue the withdrawal of Iranian-backed forces from Syria and a political solution in that country. He said the United States was leaving a contingent of American troops at the Al Tanf base in south-central Syria, as a deterrent to Iranian movements in that region.\nThe past few days have been turbulent for Mr. Bolton. He traveled to Turkey to present a list of conditions for the Syria withdrawal, including a pledge by the Turks not to attack America\u2019s Kurdish allies in Syria. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan rejected that demand and refused to see Mr. Bolton.\nOn Sunday, Mr. Trump backed up his national security adviser, declaring on Twitter that the United States would \u201cdevastate Turkey economically if they hit Kurds.\u201d\nWith Mr. Pompeo overseeing the nuclear negotiations with North Korea and taking a prominent role on China policy, Mr. Bolton has made Iran the heart of his focus as national security adviser. He scored an early victory when Mr. Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal negotiated by his predecessor, Barack Obama.\nMr. McMaster, backed by Mr. Mattis and former Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, had talked Mr. Trump out of withdrawing from the deal on multiple occasions. Even Mr. Pompeo tried to salvage the deal with the Europeans in the days before the president\u2019s decision.\nIn March 2015, when Mr. Obama was negotiating the agreement, Mr. Bolton called for a military strike on Iran, writing in The New York Times that diplomacy would never prevent it from acquiring nuclear weapons.\n\u201cThe inconvenient truth is that only military action like Israel\u2019s 1981 attack on Saddam Hussein\u2019s Osirak reactor in Iraq or its 2007 destruction of a Syrian reactor, designed and built by North Korea, can accomplish what is required,\u201d Mr. Bolton wrote. \u201cTime is terribly short, but a strike can still succeed.\u201d\nBefore he joined the Trump administration, Mr. Bolton advocated \u201cthe overthrow of the mullahs\u2019 regime in Tehran.\u201d Once in office, he told Voice of America that leadership change was \u201cnot the objective of the administration.\u201d\nThe news of Mr. Bolton\u2019s effort to find a way to strike back at Iran comes as evidence is rising that Tehran is considering \u2014 or at least threatening \u2014 to leave the nuclear agreement.\nThe chief of Iran\u2019s nuclear program, Ali Akbar Salehi, an M.I.T.-educated physicist who helped negotiate the deal, said on Sunday that Tehran had begun \u201cpreliminary activities for designing\u201d a process for enrichment of uranium.\nThe actual enrichment \u2014 which he said would be at 20 percent purity, just short of being sufficient to build a nuclear weapon \u2014 would violate the accord. Under its provisions, Iran could not enrich uranium at any significant quantities until 2030.\nBut the Iranian government has been under pressure to respond to Mr. Trump\u2019s withdrawal and the reimposition of sanctions by the United States. European powers have been urging Iran not to leave the deal, fearing it would give the United States an excuse for military action.\nMr. Salehi did not say what the \u201cpreliminary activities\u201d were, or give a timetable for action. But he said the country wanted to produce \u201cmodern fuel\u201d for its Tehran Research Reactor, a small, aging reactor that was given to it, during the shah\u2019s reign, by the United States.", "date": "Jan. 13, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/13/us/politics/bolton-iran-pentagon.html", "tags": "american iran officials pentagon \u201c military bolton clash risk united fear actions increase"}
