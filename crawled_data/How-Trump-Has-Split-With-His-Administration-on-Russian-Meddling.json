{"title": "How Trump Has Split With His Administration on Russian Meddling", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump has long avoided blaming \u2014 or even naming \u2014 Russia for meddling in the 2016 election that put him in office.\nBut his administration has been far tougher on Moscow for cyberattacks that officials this week said not only sought to sway political opinions, but also wormed into power plants, aviation systems and other critical infrastructure in the United States and Europe.\nOn Thursday, Mr. Trump was studiously silent as his administration imposed sanctions on Russia for interfering in the 2016 presidential campaign and what officials called other \u201cmalicious cyberattacks.\u201d (The president did agree with a British assessment that Moscow was responsible for a nerve-gas attack in England against a former Russian spy and his daughter.)\nThe Treasury Department said the sanctions were to punish \u201cRussia\u2019s continuing destabilizing activities.\u201d And for the first time, the Department of Homeland Security and the F.B.I. directly accused Russia of committing cyberattacks against \u201cenergy, nuclear, commercial facilities, water, aviation and critical manufacturing sectors.\u201d\nLast week, by contrast, Mr. Trump said that \u201cthe Russians had no impact on our votes whatsoever.\u201d\n\u201cBut, certainly, there was meddling and probably there was meddling from other countries and maybe other individuals,\u201d the president said at a March 6 news conference.\nThis pattern of diversion has steadily increased since Mr. Trump took office. Here is a look back at how the president and his own administration have parted ways on Russia.\nFebruary 2018: Deflecting accusations of Russian meddling\nUnited States intelligence officials warned in mid-February that Russia had already begun meddling in the 2018 midterm elections. But Mr. Trump continued to suggest other countries could also be the culprit.\n\u201cBy the way, I have to say, Obama was the president during all of this meddling, or whatever you want to call it, with Russians and others possibly,\u201d he said in a Feb. 24 interview on Fox News.\nDecember 2017: Conflicting signals on national security \nMr. Trump\u2019s first national security strategy blueprint made repeated references to Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election and its \u201cinformation operations as part of its offensive cyberefforts to influence public opinion across the globe.\u201d\nYet in his speech announcing the strategy on Dec. 18, Mr. Trump made one fleeting mention of Russia: of how it and China \u201cseek to challenge American influence, values and wealth.\u201d He made no mention of Russian meddling and instead praised intelligence sharing between Russia and the United States in the face of terrorism threats.\nAugust 2017: Signing a sanctions bill reluctantly\nAfter Congress passed legislation in late July to impose sanctions on Russia and limit the president\u2019s authority to lift them, Mr. Trump signed the bill but criticized it as \u201cseriously flawed \u2014 particularly because it encroaches on the executive branch\u2019s authority to negotiate.\u201d\nMr. Trump signed the legislation on Aug. 2. Several days earlier, President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s government had retaliated by seizing two American diplomatic compounds in Russia and telling the United States Embassy in Moscow to reduce its staff across the country. Mr. Trump did not respond, and Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, declined to comment.\nHowever, the State Department described Moscow\u2019s move as \u201ca regrettable and uncalled-for act.\u201d\n\u201cWe are assessing the impact of such a limitation and how we will respond to it,\u201d the department said in a statement.\nJuly 2017: Suggesting he found Mr. Putin\u2019s denial persuasive\nAfter Mr. Trump met with Mr. Putin during a Group of 20 summit meeting, he recounted the Russian leader\u2019s assurances that Moscow did not intervene in the 2016 election.\n\u201cFirst question \u2014 first 20, 25 minutes \u2014 I said, \u2018Did you do it?\u2019 He said, \u2018No, I did not, absolutely not.\u2019 I then asked him a second time, in a totally different way. He said, \u2018Absolutely not,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump said in an interview with Reuters that was published on July 12. \u201cSomebody did say if he did do it, you wouldn\u2019t have found out about it. Which is a very interesting point.\u201d\nJanuary 2017: Playing down Russian cyberattacks\nOn Jan. 6, the intelligence community released a declassified report of its conclusions about a Russian cyberattack on the election. In a statement about his briefing on the cyberattacks that day, Mr. Trump pointed to \u201cRussia, China, other countries.\u201d\nDays before his inauguration, at a Jan. 11 news conference where he was asked whether he believed Mr. Putin ordered the hacking of American political committees, Mr. Trump said that \u201cas far as hacking, I think it was Russia.\u201d\nHe then added, \u201cBut I think we also get hacked by other countries and other people.\u201d\nMr. Trump\u2019s dismissiveness of accusations of Russian interference predates his time in the White House.\nLate December 2016: Praising Putin in the wake of sanctions\nOn Dec. 29, President Barack Obama issued sanctions against Russia and ejected 35 suspected Russian intelligence operators from the United States as punishment for Moscow\u2019s attempts to influence the election. But in a move widely believed to be aimed at fostering good relations with the incoming Trump administration, Mr. Putin announced on Dec. 30 that he would not retaliate.\nMr. Trump promptly praised Mr. Putin\u2019s decision.\nA day later, Mr. Trump said he still wasn\u2019t convinced that Russia had interfered in the election, telling reporters: \u201cAnd I know a lot about hacking. And hacking is a very hard thing to prove. So it could be somebody else.\u201d\nEarly December 2016: Disparaging intelligence agencies after reports on Russian interference\nAfter reports in December by the The New York Times and The Washington Post that United States intelligence assessments had concluded that Russian election meddling sought to aid Mr. Trump, the president-elect disagreed.\nIn an unsigned statement responding to the news, the Trump transition team dismissed the assessment by comparing it to flawed intelligence reports in the lead-up to the Iraq war.\n\u201cThese are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction,\u201d the statement said.\nOctober 2016: Questioning intelligence consensus that Russia is to blame\nOn Oct. 7, the United States intelligence community released a joint public statement saying it was \u201cconfident that the Russian government\u201d had directed cyberattacks on American individuals and institutions, including political organizations such as the Democratic National Committee.\nThree days after that, during the second presidential debate, Mr. Trump again cast doubt that Russia was responsible \u2014 or even that there was a cyberattack in the first place.\n\u201cMaybe there is no hacking. But they always blame Russia. And the reason they blame Russia because they think they\u2019re trying to tarnish me with Russia,\u201d he said.\nSeptember 2016: Continuing to cast doubt on Russian meddling\nAs the official nominees of their parties, Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton began receiving intelligence reports in early August. On Sept. 22, top Democrats on the House and Senate Intelligence Committees issued a statement saying that they had \u201cconcluded that the Russian intelligence agencies are making a serious and concerted effort to influence the U.S. election,\u201d based on briefings they had received.\nFour days later, during the first presidential debate, Mr. Trump said, \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the D.N.C.\u201d\nHe continued: \u201cI mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, O.K.?\u201d\nJune 2016: Rejecting the D.N.C. claim that Russian hackers penetrated its files\nThe Democratic National Committee and a cybersecurity firm said that Russian hackers had obtained a trove of internal campaign emails and political opposition research.\nIn response, Mr. Trump suggested that the D.N.C. fabricated the story or hacked itself: \u201cWe believe it was the D.N.C. that did the \u2018hacking\u2019 as a way to distract from the many issues facing their deeply flawed candidate and failed party leader,\u201d he said in a campaign statement on June 15.\nHe did not mention Russia.", "date": "March 16, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/16/us/politics/trump-russia-administration-fact-check.html", "tags": "administration intelligence meddling russian \u201d trump russia split"}
