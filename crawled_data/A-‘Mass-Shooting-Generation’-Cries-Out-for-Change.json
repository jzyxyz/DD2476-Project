{"title": "A \u2018Mass Shooting Generation\u2019 Cries Out for Change", "content": "PARKLAND, Fla. \u2014 Delaney Tarr, a high school senior, cannot remember a time when she did not know about school shootings.\nSo when a fire alarm went off inside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and teachers began screaming \u201cCode red!\u201d as confused students ran in and out of classrooms, Ms. Tarr, 17, knew what to do. Run to the safest place in the classroom \u2014 in this case, a closet packed with 19 students and their teacher.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been told these protocols for years,\u201d she said. \u201cMy sister is in middle school \u2014 she\u2019s 12 \u2014 and in elementary school, she had to do code red drills.\u201d\nThis is life for the children of the mass shooting generation. They were born into a world reshaped by the 1999 attack at Columbine High School in Colorado, and grew up practicing active shooter drills and huddling through lockdowns. They talked about threats and safety steps with their parents and teachers. With friends, they wondered darkly whether it could happen at their own school, and who might do it.\nNow, this generation is almost grown up. And when a gunman killed 17 people this week at Stoneman Douglas High in Parkland, Fla., the first response of many of their classmates was not to grieve in silence, but to speak out. Their urgent voices \u2014 in television interviews, on social media, even from inside a locked school office as they hid from the gunman \u2014 are now rising in the national debate over gun violence in the aftermath of yet another school shooting.\nWhile many politicians after the shooting were focused on mental health and safety, some vocal students at Stoneman Douglas High showed no reluctance in drawing attention to gun control.\nThey called out politicians over Twitter, with one student telling Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, \u201cYOU DON\u2019T UNDERSTAND.\u201d Shortly after the shooting, Cameron Kasky, a junior at the school, and a few friends started a \u201cNever Again\u201d campaign on Facebook that shared stories and perspectives from other students who survived the rampage.\nOn a day when the funerals of the shooting victims began here, more than a dozen schools from Massachusetts to Iowa to Michigan were shut down in response to copycat threats and social media interpreted in the worst light. A college near Seattle was on lockdown for several hours on Friday after an unfounded report of gunfire and in at least one case an entire district closed down. Several students have been arrested, accused of phoning in threats to their schools.\nAt other high schools across the country, students rallied in solidarity with Stoneman Douglas High and staged walkouts to protest what they called Washington\u2019s inaction in protecting students and teachers. A gun control advocacy group, Moms Demand Action, said it had been so overwhelmed with requests from students that it was setting up a parallel, student focused advocacy group.\n\u201cPeople say it\u2019s too early to talk about it,\u201d Mr. Kasky said. \u201cIf you ask me, it\u2019s way too late.\u201d\nHis argument reflects the words of other students who want action: The issue is not an abstraction to them. These are their murdered friends, their bloodstained schools, their upended lives.\nStudents said they did not want to cede the discussion over their lives to politicians and adult activists.\n\u201cWe need to take it into our hands,\u201d Mr. Kasky said.\nDavid Hogg, a 17-year-old student journalist who interviewed his classmates during the rampage in Parkland, said he had thought about the possibility of a school shooting long before shots from an AR-15 started to blast through the hallways. As he huddled with fellow students, he stayed calm and decided to try to create a record of their thoughts and views that would live on, even if the worst happened to them.\n\u201cI recorded those videos because I didn\u2019t know if I was going to survive,\u201d he said in an interview here. \u201cBut I knew that if those videos survived, they would echo on and tell the story. And that story would be one that would change things, I hoped. And that would be my legacy.\u201d\nIt is a stark change from the moments that followed the Columbine shooting in April 1999, said Austin Eubanks, who survived the shooting. Mr. Eubanks and a friend hid under a table when the two teenage gunmen walked into the library and started shooting. Mr. Eubanks was wounded. His friend, Corey DePooter, was killed.\n\u201cThere was nobody who took an activism stance,\u201d Mr. Eubanks said of Columbine\u2019s immediate aftermath. He said he began abusing opiates shortly after as a coping mechanism. \u201cI just wanted to be left alone. I was so destabilized and traumatized.\u201d\nMr. Eubanks now helps run an addiction treatment center in Colorado and has sons of his own, aged 8 and 12. The oldest has asked why Columbine happened and whether he needs to be afraid, and Mr. Eubanks said he has tried to make the boys feel safe while also discussing how children can drift toward violence.\nNo matter how rare school shootings are for the vast majority of students, they have grown up in a world so attuned to these threats that high schoolers are now more conversant in the language of lockdowns and code red drills than their parents.\nSpencer Collier, the police chief in Selma, Ala., was chatting recently with a group of high school students when they brought up mass shootings and pressed him about current trends and what law enforcement agencies were doing to address them. In Connecticut, Nathaniel Laske, a high school junior, said he had asked school administrators about the apparent absence of lockdown drills or a mass shooting plan in the event something happened during school theater productions.\n\u201cA lot of people aren\u2019t willing to talk about it,\u201d Mr. Laske said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re part of a school community it makes you much more inclined to want to prevent things.\u201d\nSoon after Amy Campbell-Oates, 16, heard about the Parkland shooting, she knew she wanted to try, in some small way, to influence the national discussion on gun violence. She and two friends organized a protest, made posters, and on Friday, they rallied with dozens of fellow students from South Broward High School.\nThey carried signs that read \u201cIt Could\u2019ve Been Us,\u201d and \u201cYour Silence is Killing Us,\u201d and \u201cWe Stand with Stoneman Douglas.\u201d They chanted, their collective voices rising as cars honked in support.\n\u201cWe agreed that our politicians have to do more than say thoughts and prayers,\u201d Ms. Campbell-Oates said. \u201cWe want voters to know that midterms are coming up. Some of us can\u2019t vote yet but we want to get to the people that can to vote in common sense laws, ban assault rifles and require mental health checks before gun purchases.\u201d\nTyra Hemans, a senior at Stoneman Douglas High, made a poster, too, emblazoned with the word \u201cENOUGH.\u201d On Friday, Ms. Hemans attended the funeral for Meadow Pollack, one of the 17 people killed, and then she spoke about her desire to see President Trump when he visits the area.\n\u201cI want our politicians to stop thinking about money and start thinking about all these lives we have lost,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to talk with him about changing these laws. Seventeen people are dead, killed in minutes.\u201d", "date": "Feb. 16, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/16/us/columbine-mass-shootings.html", "tags": "shooting \u2018 want generation high \u201d change cries mass school \u2014 students"}
