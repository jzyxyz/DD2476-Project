{"title": "Donald Trump's Approval Rating Is In The Toilet", "content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s latest approval rating has sunk to a\u00a0new low, according to the latest Gallup poll.\nOnly 37 percent of Americans approve of the job Trump is doing, and 58 percent disapprove, the daily poll found Sunday.\u00a0Those are the worst ratings since he took office eight weeks ago. His approval rating stood at 45 percent just nine days ago.\nTrump\u2019s approval rating is lower than any other\u00a0president at this point in his first term since Gallup started tracking the numbers 72 years ago in 1945.\u00a0Barack Obama\u2019s rating at this point in his presidency was 60 percent.\nHuffPost Pollster\u2019s aggregate, which combines publicly available polling data, currently puts Trump\u2019s approval rating slightly higher at 44 percent, with 53 percent disapproving.\nIt\u2019s not clear which of several issues may have torpedoed the president\u2019s numbers.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s been a tough week for Trump. His health plan was zapped by the Congressional Budget Office, which revealed some 24 million Americans would be cut out of health insurance over the next decade. His revised travel ban was blocked again in court. And he\u2019s being hammered over his insistence that he was wiretapped during the presidential campaign by Obama, despite what his own intelligence officers are saying and the findings of the intelligence committees in both the House and Senate.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, questions continue about his associates\u2019 connections with Russia. A hearing Monday will address both Trump\u2019s wiretapping allegations and Russian ties.\u00a0\nTrump also had an awkward meeting Friday with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.\nObama\u2019s lowest approval rating throughout both of his terms was 39 percent\u00a0in a Zogby Poll, higher than Trump\u2019s now in his early days in office when a young presidency is usually popular. Trump skewered Obama over the 39 percent numbers in 2011.\nGallup\u2019s daily poll results are based on telephone interviews with 1,500 people nationwide and have a 3 percent margin of error.", "date": "\n03/20/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-approval-rating_n_58cf74b7e4b0be71dcf5b696", "tags": "toilet office percent approval rating poll ago trump donald obama gallup"}
