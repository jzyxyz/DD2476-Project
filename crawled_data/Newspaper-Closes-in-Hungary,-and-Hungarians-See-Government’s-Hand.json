{"title": "Newspaper Closes in Hungary, and Hungarians See Government\u2019s Hand", "content": "BUDAPEST \u2014 Roland Baksa, an investigative reporter at Hungary\u2019s largest opposition newspaper, packed up his computer on Friday. The publication\u2019s parent company had announced that it would move offices over the weekend, and the editor in chief had promised pizza on Sunday to celebrate the move.\nBut on Saturday, Mr. Baksa found that he could access neither his work email nor the newspaper\u2019s website, including its archives. Mediaworks, the parent company, had replaced the website of the newspaper, Nepszabadsag, with  an announcement that it was suspending publication immediately, because of steep circulation losses over the last decade.\nMr. Baksa and many of his roughly 50 colleagues, whose jobs are now in limbo, suspect another motivation: interference from the government of Hungary\u2019s populist, right-wing prime minister, Viktor Orban, which has reined in government-run media and appears to be wielding increasing influence over privately run news companies as well.\nIn the newspaper\u2019s final week, it reported that the head of Mr. Orban\u2019s cabinet office had flown to a celebrity wedding by helicopter \u2014 an exorbitant expense that he had initially denied. The same week, Mr. Baksa revealed that the governor of the central bank was living in a luxury apartment owned by the president of the Hungarian Banking Association. Earlier, he had reported on the governor\u2019s romance with a young woman who was consequently hired by the central bank for a record salary.\n\u201cI was aware these stories might not be to the liking of Viktor Orban\u2019s government,\u201d Mr. Baksa said in an interview, but he was not expecting \u201cthe drastic closure of our newsroom.\u201d\nThe newspaper\u2019s deputy editor in chief, Marton Gergely, said he felt \u201cpretty sure Viktor Orban himself is hiding in the background.\u201d\nThe state minister for government communication, Bence Tuzson, rejected those accusations.\n\u201cThe true violation of freedom of the press would be if the government interfered with the decision of a media owner,\u201d he said in an interview, denying any role by Mr. Orban\u2019s government.\nSzilard Nemeth, the co-chairman of Fidesz, Mr. Orban\u2019s political party, noted that Nepszabadsag was the Communist Party\u2019s mouthpiece from 1956 \u2014 when the Soviet Union cracked down on a Hungarian uprising that threatened to challenge its sway over Eastern Europe \u2014 until 1989, when communism fell. \u201cMy humble opinion is that it was high time Nepszabadsag shut down unexpectedly,\u201d he told reporters.\nHungarians do not seem convinced by the official explanation. Social media pages have filled with expressions of support for the newspaper. On Saturday night, several thousand people protested in front of Parliament, some of them demanding that Mr. Orban resign.\n\u201cI was not a frequent reader of the newspaper, but it\u2019s important we have pluralism of media in Hungary,\u201d said one of the demonstrators, Eva Tubakos, 54, an unemployed event organizer. \u201cThe problem is our government does not bear any sort of criticism. The way Nepszabadsag was shut down is not the sign of a healthy democracy.\u201d\nJudit Bayer, a media lawyer who teaches at Budapest Business School, said Mr. Orban, in office since 2010, had learned from his previous stint as prime minister, from 1998 to 2002. His government passed a law in 2010 that tightened control over media outlets, prompting hand-wringing among European Union officials who feared that Hungary was violating the bloc\u2019s guarantees of a free press.\nCriticism of Mr. Orban is not unheard-of. His former ally and business partner Lajos Simicska \u2014 he was once his university roommate \u2014 owns two newspapers, one of them a weekly, as well as a radio station and a TV station. The two men had a rift last year, and Mr. Simicska\u2019s companies have become critical of Mr. Orban.\nGabor Polyak, an analyst at Mertek Media Monitor, a watchdog organization, said that the Hungarian media landscape was constantly changing and had recently come under the influence of a new type of wealthy oligarchs closer to Mr. Orban.\nLast year, the country\u2019s second-largest TV channel, previously owned by a German company, was sold to a Hungarian-American film producer \u2014 who is also a government official \u2014 and its editorial stance became strongly pro-government. But Mr. Polyak said Nepszabadsag was too much of an established brand to be converted into a pro-government title.\nMediaworks, the parent company of Nepszabadsag, is owned by Vienna Capital Partners, an Austrian-based private equity firm. Heinrich Pecina, its principal owner, did not respond to messages requesting comment on the decision to close the paper.\nAndras Petho, a former reporter at Origo, a news website whose editor was forced out in 2014 after exposing lavish travel abroad by one of Mr. Orban\u2019s ministers, said he was \u201cnot surprised by what happened to Nepszabadsag.\u201d His former employer, under new ownership, is no longer critical of the government.\n\u201cIt definitely seems to fit in a familiar pattern,\u201d said Mr. Petho, who now runs an investigative journalism website, Direkt36, that relies on reader donations and grants from institutions like the Open Society Foundations, set up by George Soros.\nTamas Bodoky, who runs Atlatszo, another partly crowd-funded investigative website, said, \u201cThere are fewer and fewer workplaces for journalists willing to expose corruption, and they mostly exist on the internet.\u201d He noted that the government was a major advertiser, running campaign ads, for example, before the recent referendum on European Union quotas for resettling refugees. (The referendum rejecting the quotas passed overwhelmingly, but the turnout was too low for a legally valid result.)\nGabor Borokai, the chief editor at Heti Valasz, a right-leaning weekly partly owned by Mr. Simicska, said it had lost 10 percent to 15 percent of its annual revenues after the falling-out between Mr. Simicska and Mr. Orban. \u201cIf Nepszabadsag\u2019s owners acted rationally, they would have cut the number of pages,\u201d rather than close the newspaper after investing in a redesign, Mr. Borokai said. He theorized that the company had been sold to a new owner.", "date": "Oct. 11, 2016", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/12/world/europe/hungary-newspaper-nepszabadsag.html", "tags": "hand see closes \u201c hungary media nepszabadsag orban hungarians government newspaper \u2014"}
