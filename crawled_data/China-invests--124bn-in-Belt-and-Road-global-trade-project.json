Instead we will create a new model of co-operation and mutual benefit,\" Mr Xi said at the opening of the two-day summit.\n\"We should build an open platform of co-operation and uphold and grow an open world economy,\" he added.\nA Chinese idea but for everyone's benefit. That's how Mr Xi presented his Belt and Road vision to drive trade and prosperity through Chinese built infrastructure. \nPresident Putin of Russia and President Erdogan of Turkey were among those applauding from the front row as the Chinese leader talked of a big family of harmonious co-existence and pledged billions of dollars in loans and investment.\nBut neighbours Japan and India have stayed away from the summit, suspicious that China's development agenda masks a bid for strategic assets and geopolitical ambitions. And some economists are cautious about the viability of projects in areas of political instability and poor governance. \nIn his keynote address on Sunday, Mr Xi ignored the doubters. He talked of a new model of win-win co-operation, an implicit bid for Chinese global leadership at a time when other big economic powers like the United States and the European Union are preoccupied with internal problems.\nRead more: China's big push for its global trade narrative\nMr Xi said that it was time for the world to promote open development and encourage the building of systems of \"fair, reasonable and transparent global trade and investment rules\".\n\"China is willing to share its development experience with all countries. We will not interfere in other countries' internal affairs,\" he said.\n\"No matter if they are from Asia and Europe, or Africa or the Americas, they are all co-operative partners in building the Belt and Road.\" \nWhat is China's new Silk Road?\nMr Xi did not give a timeframe for the distribution of funds pledged for the projects outlined on Sunday. \nLeaders from 29 countries are attending the Belt and Road forum, which ends on Monday, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayep Erdogan.\nSeveral other European leaders, including the prime ministers of Spain, Italy, Greece and Hungary, are also attending the summit.", "date": "14 May 2017", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-39912671", "tags": "project belt xi china development road global chinese trade invests"}
