{"title": "Pathankot: Gunmen attack India air force base near Pakistan border", "content": "Five attackers and three members of the security forces been killed in an attack on an Indian air force base near the Pakistani border, officials say.\nSecurity personnel secured Pathankot base on Saturday evening, after a battle lasting more than 14 hours.\nThe heavily-armed gunmen entered the base dressed in Indian army uniforms. \nThe attack came days after the Indian and Pakistani leaders, Narendra Modi and Nawaz Sharif, met in Lahore to launch a surprise peace initiative.\nNo group has said it carried out the attack, which is being seen as an attempt to undermine those efforts.\nAll of India's Punjab state has been placed on alert. Soldiers are combing the area around the base looking for more militants.\n\"We want peace but if terrorists carry out attacks on Indian soil we will give them a befitting reply,\" said Indian Home Minister Rajnath Singh.\nPakistan condemned the attack and called it a \"terrorist incident\", adding that it remained committed to peace efforts with India.\nThe gunmen drove a hijacked police vehicle when they launched the attack at 03:30 (22:00 GMT Friday).\nThey entered living quarters at the base, but were contained there and so were unable to cause any damage to military hardware, said air force spokeswoman Rochelle D'Silva. \nLater on Saturday morning, fresh gunfire was heard and a helicopter seen firing at an area inside the base.\nBut by the end of the afternoon, police confirmed the base was secure.\nThe BBC's Sanjoy Majumder in Delhi says it is not yet clear who the attackers were - but suspicion is already falling on Kashmiri militant groups based in Pakistan.\nSome Indian security officials suggested the Islamist militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed was to blame.\nIndia says the group is backed by Pakistan, but Islamabad denies this.\nIn July seven people were killed in a similar attack when gunmen stormed a police station in nearby Gurdaspur district.\nThe three attackers in Gurdaspur were killed after a 12-hour standoff with police.\nPathankot air force base is about 430km (270 miles) north of the Indian capital, Delhi and is on the road linking Indian-administered Kashmir with the rest of the country.\nIndian-administered Kashmir has seen a long-running insurgency against rule from Delhi, and Kashmir has been a flashpoint in relations between Pakistan and India for nearly 70 years since independence.
