{"title": "Ordinary Iranians on Trump Talks Offer: \u2018Why Not Try the Americans?\u2019", "content": "TEHRAN \u2014 Iran\u2019s leaders cannot stand the thought of talking to the United States and say President Trump cannot be trusted. But Jamshid Moniri, a 45-year-old building contractor sweating under the Tehran summer sun, summed up what many ordinary Iranians think.\n\u201cOf course we should talk to Trump,\u201d he said on Tuesday. \u201cWhat is wrong with talks? We\u2019d be nuts not to talk to him.\u201d\nThe day before, Mr. Trump, who withdrew the United States from the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran in May despite Iran\u2019s documented compliance, said he was ready to sit down with Iran\u2019s leaders \u201cwithout preconditions.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll meet with anybody,\u201d Mr. Trump said in Washington. \u201cIf they want to meet, I\u2019ll meet. Anytime they want.\u201d\nOn Tuesday, in Tehran, Mr. Trump\u2019s open invitation seemed to be on everybody\u2019s mind. Increasingly desperate, many say they would welcome any option that could ease Iran\u2019s economic quagmire.\nThe Iranian currency, the rial, has lost 80 percent of its value during the past year \u2014 and nearly 20 percent just in the past few days. Foreign investors have left to avoid new American sanctions that take effect starting in less than a week. And almost every week low-level protests over prices or wages erupt somewhere in the country that have the potential to spread if the economic free-fall worsens.\nMr. Moniri, the contractor, said he feared that what is considered bad now could get a lot worse. \u201cSo we should welcome talks,\u201d he said. \u201cOur leaders should welcome this opportunity.\u201d\nBut if anything, Iran\u2019s leaders seem paralyzed by Mr. Trump\u2019s offer.\nDirect talks with the United States go against their ideology. And in their minds, sitting down publicly with Mr. Trump, whom they have called particularly ignorant, capricious, arrogant and rude, would be an especially humiliating submission to imperialism and pressure.\nWhen dealing with the United States over the past decades, Iranian leaders have often preferred to do it through secret talks, far from ordinary Iranians, who are bombarded daily with organized anti-Americanism from their schoolbooks to state television.\n\u201cThere can only be talks when Trump respects the signatures of the U.S. administration in the nuclear agreement,\u201d said Hossein Sheikholeslam, a senior adviser to Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif. \u201cTrump should reverse the pullout from the nuclear deal, or else there will be no talks.\u201d\nAyatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, who has enshrined anti-Americanism as a tenet of his legacy, made clear after Mr. Trump renounced the nuclear agreement that he would never talk with the American leader. \u201cTrump will wither away, perish, and his body will decompose, but, the Islamic Republic will still be thriving,\u201d Mr. Khamenei proclaimed in a speech.\nHis view was reinforced on Tuesday by the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, the powerful paramilitary force that is intensely loyal to Mr. Khamenei.\n\u201cMr. Trump! Iran is not North Korea to accept your offer for a meeting,\u201d said the commander, Maj. Gen. Mohammad Ali Jafari, in remarks quoted by Reuters. \u201cEven U.S. presidents after you will not see that day.\u201d\nBut many ordinary Iranians said Tuesday that they thought direct talks with Mr. Trump could be a pathway to solving Iran\u2019s most pressing problems.\nSitting behind the wheel of a Peugeot 206, a French car produced in Iran, Ghader Safarzadeh explained that he thinks of himself as a patient man. His spotless car resembled his well-kept black mustache.\nLiving off a dwindling pension, Mr. Safarzadeh works a couple of days a week as a taxi driver. He calculated that with the rising dollar, a cab ride that last year earned him the equivalent of $5 now made him $1.50.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t live like this for very long,\u201d he said.\nPriced in rials, the costs of houses and cars have quickly doubled. At the Allaedin mobile phone bazaar, an iPhone X now costs four times more in rials than a year ago. People fear their wages in the Iranian currency could soon become practically worthless. The French school in Tehran is seeking teachers from abroad, but can offer a salary of only 20 million rials, or $200, a month.\nThere seemed no doubt in Mr. Safarzadeh\u2019s mind that his leaders must talk to Mr. Trump. \u201cWhat should be first is the economic welfare of the people,\u201d he said.\nAnti-Americanism has held Iran back, and especially now, with an unpredictable leader in the United States, it is dangerous, he said. \u201cOur leaders need to be wise and talk to this man,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody else is doing it, why should we be different?\u201d\nOthers said they had no idea who to trust anymore.\n\u201cThey are both bad, Trump and our leaders,\u2019\u2019 said Shahnaz Bagheri, a widow in her 60s. The past year had been tough for her. Her husband died after a long illness, Mrs. Bagheri said, and she has been overtaken by economic worries.\n\u201cSanctions, devaluation \u2014 what should come of us?\u201d she said.\nFor Mrs. Bagheri, Mr. Trump and Iran\u2019s ruling establishment are doing the same disservice.\n\u201cThey are bothering ordinary people,\u201d she said. \u201cThey all speak as if they care for Iranians, but in reality all pressure is on us.\u201d\nStill, Mrs. Bagheri expressed doubt that direct talks between Mr. Trump and President Hassan Rouhani of Iran would automatically help improve the lives of ordinary Iranians.\n\u201cThis Trump has many complexes and he is not interested in compromise, so talking to him might mean we end up losing even more,\u201d Mrs. Bagheri said. \u201cI just want a better life for our people.\u201d\nThe economic problems, combined with dozens of corruption cases that have exposed high-level greed, have made it difficult for Iran\u2019s leaders to convince people that talking to the United States is a bad option, something supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei highlighted in a speech two weeks ago.\n\u201cOf course Trump is manipulating our people by calling for talks,\u201d said Nader Karimi Joni, a journalist and activist critical of Iran\u2019s government. \u201cHe knows our leaders will decline. For ordinary people in Iran, it doesn\u2019t matter whether Trump can be trusted, is crazy or even is serious about really negotiating. They just hear Trump wants to talk and our leaders don\u2019t.\u201d\nIran\u2019s leadership has been trying to show the appearance of unity, and has taken on a defensive posture. Both President Rouhani and several commanders warned that they could close the Strait of Hormuz, a key passageway for global oil traffic, whenever they like.\nBut not everybody believes that would accomplish much.\n\u201cLet\u2019s face it,\u201d said Reza Asghari, a 50-year-old businessman. \u201cWe can\u2019t really close off the Strait without inviting U.S. military action. In fact, we can\u2019t even make preconditions for direct talks. Who are we to do that? We need jobs, not more tension.\u201d\nRumors are swirling across Tehran that secret talks with the United States have already begun. On Friday the foreign minister of Oman, the Persian Gulf sultanate that hosted the secret meetings between Iranian and American officials that led to the nuclear talks, may visit Tehran. The minister, Yusuf bin Alawi bin Abdullah, was in Washington last week.\nSome Iranians have expressed hope that Russia, which supports the nuclear agreement and has sought to strengthen strategic ties with Iran, will help cushion the effect of reimposed sanctions.\nStill, Russia-Iran relations have their own tense history. The countries are rivals in oil production. Many Iranians mistrust Russia over what they view as its past failures to honor agreements on arms sales and energy.\n\u201cWe are betting on the Russians for support, but they have betrayed us many times,\u201d said Kheba Majidi, a 35-year-old graduate student who was walking home from the green grounds of Tehran University. \u201cOur officials should be wise before it\u2019s too late and start negotiations publicly. Why not try the Americans?\u201d", "date": "July 31, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/31/world/middleeast/iran-trump-talks.html", "tags": "iran ordinary \u2018 leaders tehran united \u201d trump try offer iranians americans said talks"}
