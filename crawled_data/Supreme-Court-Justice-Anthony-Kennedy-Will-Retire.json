{"title": "Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy Will Retire", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Justice Anthony M. Kennedy announced on Wednesday that he would retire this summer, setting in motion a furious fight over the future of the Supreme Court and giving President Trump the chance to put a conservative stamp on the American legal system for generations.\nJustice Kennedy, 81, has been a critical swing vote on the sharply polarized court for nearly three decades as he embraced liberal views on gay rights, abortion and the death penalty but helped conservatives trim voting rights, block gun control measures and unleash campaign spending by corporations.\nHis replacement by a conservative justice \u2014 something Mr. Trump has vowed to his supporters \u2014 could imperil a variety of landmark Supreme Court precedents on social issues where Justice Kennedy frequently sided with his liberal colleagues, particularly on abortion.\nMr. Trump and his Republican allies have hoped for months that Justice Kennedy might retire, clearing a way for a new, more conservative jurist before Democrats had an opportunity to capture the Senate and block future Republican nominees. In contrast to his frequent criticisms of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., a generally reliable conservative, Mr. Trump has frequently heaped praise on Justice Kennedy and even has suggested that he might nominate one of his former clerks to the bench \u2014 subtle nudges the president hoped would make Justice Kennedy more comfortable with the idea of stepping down.\nJustice Kennedy\u2019s departure could leave Chief Justice Roberts, who was appointed by George W. Bush, as the decisive vote on a court whose other justices may soon include four committed liberals and four equally committed conservatives.\nThe court\u2019s term that just ended offered a preview of what such a lineup might mean: With Justice Kennedy mostly siding with conservatives this year, the court endorsed Mr. Trump\u2019s power over immigration, dealt a blow to labor unions and backed a Republican purge of voter rolls in Ohio.\nJustice Kennedy hand-delivered a short letter of resignation to Mr. Trump on Wednesday afternoon, shortly after a half-hour meeting at the White House, where the president called him a jurist with \u201ctremendous vision and tremendous heart.\u201d\n\u201cPlease permit me by this letter to express my profound gratitude for having had the privilege to seek in each case how best to know, interpret and defend the Constitution and the laws that must always conform to its mandates and promises,\u201d Justice Kennedy wrote to Mr. Trump.\nThe president called Justice Kennedy a \u201cspecial guy\u201d and a \u201cstar\u201d during a Wednesday night rally in Fargo, N.D., and said that he would find a replacement with \u201cintellect\u201d who would last for several decades on the bench.\nEarlier in the day, Mr. Trump promised to begin an immediate search for a replacement and to pick from a list of 25 conservative jurists he had previously identified as candidates for the court\u2019s next vacancy. In comments to reporters, Mr. Trump said he would nominate \u201csomebody who will be just as outstanding\u201d as Justice Kennedy.\nPotential nominees include Brett M. Kavanaugh, a federal appellate judge for the District of Columbia Circuit who clerked for Justice Kennedy at the Supreme Court. Another possibility is Judge Thomas M. Hardiman of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, whom Mr. Trump seriously considered last year to replace Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in 2016. The president chose Judge Neil M. Gorsuch instead.\nThe Senate, which must confirm the president\u2019s pick for the court, is under Republican control, which gives Mr. Trump the opportunity to win approval of his choice without any Democratic support. But the Senate\u2019s makeup could change after congressional elections this fall, putting immense pressure on the president and his party to nominate and confirm a justice before November.\nSenator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, called on senators to make sure the president\u2019s nominee would be \u201cconsidered fairly\u201d without being subjected to personal or character attacks.\n\u201cWe will vote to confirm Justice Kennedy\u2019s successor this fall,\u201d Mr. McConnell vowed in brief remarks on Wednesday.\nBut Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, demanded that the Senate wait to confirm Justice Kennedy\u2019s replacement until after the midterm elections. Mr. Schumer noted that Republicans delayed consideration of President Barack Obama\u2019s court nominee in 2016, Judge Merrick B. Garland, citing the presidential election that year.\nThe Republicans prevented even a hearing for Mr. Obama\u2019s nominee, which effectively handed Mr. Trump the chance to fill the vacancy created by the death of Justice Scalia. The move infuriated Democrats, who accused Republicans of stealing Mr. Obama\u2019s right to fill a seat on the court.\nMr. Schumer said senators should not \u201cconsider a Supreme Court justice in an election year,\u201d saying that \u201canything but that would be the absolute height of hypocrisy.\u201d\n\u201cPeople are just months away from determining the senators who should vote to confirm or reject the president\u2019s nominee,\u201d Mr. Schumer said on the floor of the Senate, \u201cand their voices deserve to be heard now, as Senator McConnell thought that they deserved to be heard then.\u201d\nJustice Kennedy, a Californian and graduate of Harvard Law School, was appointed to the Supreme Court by President Ronald Reagan in 1987. But he was never a reliable conservative and evolved into one of the court\u2019s most unpredictable jurists.\nHe wrote some of the country\u2019s most important gay rights decisions and helped to drastically shift the United States\u2019 legal treatment of gays, lesbians and transgender people. In 2015, he wrote the court\u2019s opinion that established the right for gay people to marry each other.\n\u201cTheir hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization\u2019s oldest institutions,\u201d Justice Kennedy wrote of gay Americans. \u201cThey ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right.\u201d\nJustice Kennedy has also served as the linchpin of the judicial defense of abortion rights, frequently siding with the court\u2019s liberals in turning back conservative challenges to Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 case that established a constitutional right to abortion.\nBut Justice Kennedy has also been a decisive vote for rulings that cemented conservative principles in some of the most contentious issues in American political life.\nHe wrote the opinion in Citizens United, which gave corporations the right to make unlimited campaign contributions. He joined the court\u2019s conservatives in 2008 in declaring that the Constitution protects a person\u2019s right to keep a loaded gun at home for self-defense.\nAfter the 2000 election, Justice Kennedy also joined the majority in Bush v. Gore, handing the presidency to Mr. Bush and drawing the ire of Democrats who believed the election was stolen from Vice President Al Gore.\nIn leaving this year, Justice Kennedy gives Mr. Trump and the Republican Party the opportunity to undermine the permanence of the liberal cases that he shaped. His retirement will have far more effect than Mr. Trump\u2019s selection of Justice Gorsuch, a conservative who replaced another conservative, Justice Scalia.\nDuring the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump promised voters that he would choose a Supreme Court nominee \u2014 should he get the opportunity \u2014 from a list of mostly conservative judges that he made public.\nHe first offered 11 names, then added 10 more, compiled by Donald F. McGahn II, Mr. Trump\u2019s longtime election lawyer and now the White House counsel, with input from the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation, two conservative legal organizations. Since last year, the list \u2014 which is published at whitehouse.gov \u2014 has grown to 25 names.\n\u201cWe have a very excellent list of great, talented, highly educated, highly intelligent \u2014 hopefully, tremendous \u2014 people. I think the list is very outstanding,\u201d Mr. Trump said Wednesday. \u201cSo it will be somebody from that list.\u201d\nIn addition to Judge Kavanaugh and Judge Hardiman, Mr. Trump is expected to seriously consider William H. Pryor Jr. and Amul R. Thapar, both appeals courts judges. Mr. Trump interviewed Judges Hardiman, Pryor and Thapar in 2017 before picking Judge Gorsuch.\nThe White House is likely to conduct a similar process this year, with Mr. Trump meeting personally with several candidates and discussing the issue with advisers inside and outside the administration.\nBecause Mr. Trump is unpredictable, it is possible that he might pick someone like Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, a conservative lawmaker who appears on the president\u2019s list of 25 possible nominees. Mr. Trump could also, despite his pledge, veer from the list and pick someone else.\nIn his remarks to reporters shortly after meeting with Justice Kennedy, the president appeared to appreciate the gravity of the choice before him.\n\u201cIn our country, the selection of a justice of the United States Supreme Court is considered, I think we can all say, one of the most important events \u2014 one of the most important things for our country,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, you see the decisions that just came down, how big they are, how vital they are.\u201d\n\u201cSome people think,\u201d the president added, \u201coutside of, obviously, war and peace, it\u2019s the most important thing that you could have.\u201d", "date": "June 27, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/27/us/politics/anthony-kennedy-retire-supreme-court.html", "tags": "retire kennedy court justice supreme \u201d conservative \u2014 anthony"}
