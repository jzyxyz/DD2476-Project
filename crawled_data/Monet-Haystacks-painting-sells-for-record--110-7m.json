Sotheby's did not name the new owner.\nMonet's Haystacks series had 25 paintings, the majority of which hang in art galleries around the world. \nThis is one of only four of his works to go under the hammer this century.\nNymph\u00e9as en fleur was previously the most expensive Monet painting, selling for $84.7m in May 2018.", "date": "15 May 2019", "href": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48278312", "tags": "work world haystacks sale painting record bought series sells new monet artist"}
