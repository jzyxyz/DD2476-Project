And as the number of demonstrators grew, the demands started to include a call for top officials from the capital, Tehran, to come to Ahvaz to see the problems for themselves.\nDemonstrators can also be heard shouting, \u201cUnemployment, unemployment,\u201d another big problem in the region, and urging their countrymen to offer assistance: \u201cIranian compatriots, help us, help us.\u201d\nIn the weeks before the demonstrations, Ahvaz was hit by large dust storms. Rain turned the dust into mud, which caused power stations to stop working.\nOil production was also affected, with the Ministry of Petroleum reporting that production had temporarily fallen by 700,000 barrels a day.\nIn addition to the short-term effects of the dust storm, the city is wrestling with long-term environmental challenges.\nAhvaz, home to around one million people, is surrounded by petrochemical factories that emit pollutants on a large scale.\nA 15-year drought, in combination with poorly planned dam building, has caused local marshes to dry up, increasing the level of dust particles in the air to record highs.\nThe World Health Organization said in 2015 that Ahvaz was the most polluted city in the world.\nLocals said they felt ignored and had had enough. \u201cWe feel as if we live in a special zone, where the government only makes money from,\u201d said Mobin Ataee, a local student. \u201cIt seems they would prefer people to leave so they can turn this whole area into an oil-business-only region.\u201d\nState television, dominated by hard-liners, highlighted the protests at first, seemingly to place the moderate government of President Hassan Rouhani in a difficult position. One local reporter even presented the news wearing a protective mask against air pollution in protest.\nBut as the number of protesters started increasing, the official news media fell silent.\nOn Saturday, the local police issued a statement calling on people to refrain from \u201cillegal gatherings,\u201d warning that they would be \u201cconfronted\u201d if they took part.\nWitnesses reported the presence of riot police officers on the streets of Ahvaz. The Iranian authorities did not allow a New York Times reporter to visit the city.\n\u201cThe major part of the flaws and defects have either been resolved or are in the process of being resolved,\u201d said the police statement, published by the semiofficial Fars news agency.\nThe complex mix of problems facing the city, from dust to water shortages and unemployment, may prove hard to solve.\n\u201cThe situation is terrible and extremely complex,\u201d said Mitra Hajjar, a prominent Iranian actress and ecological activist.\nA photograph of her posing on a landmark bridge in Ahvaz wearing a protective mask was widely shared on Instagram, Iran\u2019s most popular social media tool that is not filtered by the authorities.\n\u201cThe government is now trying to flood the marshes,\u201d Ms. Hajjar said. \u201cThat is a good first step, but basically, we have to restore an entire ecosystem.\u201d\nVisitors to the city are often quick to complain of the pollution there, said Forough Emam, 26, an Ahvaz native who moved to Tehran to study. \u201cBut for us from Ahvaz, pollution means you can\u2019t see two meters ahead, and everything is covered in brown dust.\u201d", "date": "Feb. 19, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/19/world/middleeast/iran-ahvaz-pollution-protests.html", "tags": "ahvaz iran \u2018 protests tehran city local \u201d brown everything dust iranian covered government"}
