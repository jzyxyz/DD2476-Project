{"title": "Trump, Citing \u2018a Witch Hunt,\u2019 Denies Any Collusion With Russia", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump declared angrily on Thursday that he was the victim of a witch hunt, and all but contradicted his deputy attorney general on the firing of the F.B.I. director, in an extensive denial of any collusion between his campaign and Russia.\nMr. Trump used a chaotic White House news conference with Colombia\u2019s leader to directly confront a weeklong barrage of criticism and questions in a political storm that he said was dividing the nation. He also conspicuously distanced himself from aides like his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, in repeating his claim that Moscow and its agents had not secretly assisted his campaign.\n\u201cI respect the move,\u201d Mr. Trump said of the Justice Department\u2019s decision on Wednesday to appoint a special counsel to investigate the matter. \u201cBut the entire thing has been a witch hunt.\u201d\n\u201cAnd there is no collusion between, certainly, myself and my campaign \u2014 but I can always speak for myself \u2014 and the Russians,\u201d he said. \u201cZero.\u201d\nMr. Trump made his comments while standing alongside Colombia\u2019s president, Juan Manuel Santos. As he dug in his heels, Mr. Trump further muddied his explanation of why he dismissed the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey \u2014 and in doing so, offered a different version of events from one given to senators just hours earlier by the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein.\nIn that meeting, Mr. Rosenstein outlined his decision to appoint Robert S. Mueller III, a former F.B.I. director, as special counsel. Several senators emerged afterward to say Mr. Rosenstein had told them he was certain that the president was going to dismiss Mr. Comey, even before he wrote a memo critical of the director\u2019s performance.\nBut at his news conference, Mr. Trump reverted to the White House\u2019s original claim that he was primarily responding to Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s recommendation to dismiss Mr. Comey. The president had later claimed that he had moved against Mr. Comey in part because of his frustration over the F.B.I.\u2019s handling of the Russia investigation.\n\u201cDirector Comey was very unpopular with most people,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Thursday. \u201cWhen I made that decision, I actually thought that it would be a bipartisan decision. Because you look at all of the people on the Democratic side, not only the Republican side, that were saying such terrible things about Director Comey.\u201d\nThere was a palpable sense among the senators who filed out of the briefing room that the center of gravity in the investigation was shifting from Capitol Hill to Mr. Mueller, who will spend weeks assembling a staff and a list of witnesses to interview.\n\u201cThis pretty much shuts Congress down,\u201d Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, told reporters. \u201cDemocrats, you got what you wanted. You got a special counsel. Now we\u2019ll just move on. We\u2019re not prosecutors.\u201d\nThe prospect of Mr. Mueller, a former federal prosecutor with a reputation for moral rectitude and an exacting management style, opening a wide-ranging investigation further rattled a demoralized White House staff, only a day before Mr. Trump was scheduled to depart on a grueling nine-day trip to the Middle East and Europe. Several of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers and associates have urged him to hire an experienced outside lawyer to help him deal with the surging controversy over whether his campaign had ties to Russia, according to several people briefed on the conversations.\nMr. Trump began the day in a defiant mood, abandoning the conciliatory tone the White House had shown in a statement Wednesday evening. In an early-morning Twitter post, he cited, without evidence, \u201cillegal acts\u201d committed by the administration of his predecessor, President Barack Obama, and the campaign of his former opponent, Hillary Clinton \u2014 and said they had never led to a special counsel.\n\u201cWith all of the illegal acts that took place in the Clinton campaign & Obama Administration, there was never a special councel appointed!\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, initially misspelling counsel.\nMoments later, he added, \u201cThis is the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history!\u201d\nThe president was correct in his observation about the rarity of a special counsel, though his references to the Clinton campaign and the Obama administration did little to bolster his case. There were multiple congressional investigations into the attacks in Benghazi, Libya, and the role played by Mrs. Clinton, then the secretary of state, and Mr. Obama.\nIt was not the first time Mr. Trump likened the questions about his campaign and Russia to a witch hunt. In January, while president-elect, he said in an interview with The New York Times that the persistent focus on Russia\u2019s hacking of the American presidential campaign was a witch hunt carried out by people bitter at his victory.\nThe president elaborated on that theme in the news conference, casting the investigation as a needless distraction from the achievements of his administration, which he enthusiastically enumerated.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had tremendous success,\u201d he said. \u201cYou look at our job numbers. You look at what\u2019s going on at the border.\u201d\nSome of Mr. Trump\u2019s claims raised more questions than answers. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see some incredible numbers with respect to the success of General Mattis and others with the ISIS situation,\u201d he said, referring to the defense secretary, Jim Mattis. \u201cThe numbers are staggering, how successful they\u2019ve been.\u201d\nHe promised to name a new F.B.I. director soon, having acknowledged to reporters earlier in the day that former Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut was a top contender.\nMr. Trump\u2019s sense of grievance over the Russia investigations had been deepening even before the naming of a special counsel. On Thursday, he arrived in the East Room primed for confrontation.\nRather than call on a reporter from a conservative-leaning news organization, as he has in the past, Mr. Trump pointed to Jonathan Karl, an ABC News correspondent known for his close questioning during White House briefings.\nWhen a second reporter, Scott Thuman of the broadcaster Sinclair, asked Mr. Trump whether he had urged Mr. Comey to drop the Russia investigation, Mr. Thuman could not finish the question before the president interrupted. \u201cNo. No,\u201d Mr. Trump snapped. \u201cNext question.\u201d\nMr. Santos, a Harvard-trained economist who won the Nobel Peace Prize last year for negotiating a peace treaty with the FARC guerrillas, watched the spectacle with an inscrutable expression. After he sidestepped a question about whether he agreed with the White House plan to build a wall on the border with Mexico to halt the flow of drugs into the United States, Mr. Trump jumped in.\n\u201cThat was a very long and very diplomatic answer,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI will say it a bit shorter: Walls work. Just ask Israel.\u201d\nEarlier, Mr. Trump said that coca cultivation and cocaine production had risen to record levels in Colombia, and challenged Mr. Santos to remedy the problem.\nMr. Santos returned the favor minutes later when asked whether he had advice for Mr. Trump.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m in a position to give any advice to President Trump,\u201d Mr. Santos said with a smile. \u201cHe can take care of himself.\u201d", "date": "May 18, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/18/us/politics/trump-back-on-twitter-complains-of-witch-hunt.html", "tags": "hunt \u2018 citing president director collusion \u201d trump denies russia campaign witch special"}
