{"title": "One Of The Stupidest Anti-Obamacare Arguments Is Making A Comeback", "content": "There have been a lot of truly dumb and audaciously dishonest things said about the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare, over the years.\nThink death panels and microchips embedded under the skin.\nBut what might be one of the most boldly absurd things Republicans have said about the law is that it failed because there are still people who have no health insurance.\nSure, an estimated 20 million people have health coverage because of the law, and the national uninsured rate is the lowest it\u2019s ever been. But some people remain uninsured. Train wreck!\n\u201cObamacare itself has woefully fallen short of its goal to cover the American people,\u201d Vice President Mike Pence said during an remarks to Department of Health and Human Services employees Tuesday.\nAnd here\u2019s Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price \u2015 who absolutely knows better \u2015 lamenting this state of affairs on Twitter Tuesday, using a chart Pence displayed on stage at HHS headquarters.\nFirst, that \u201conly 10 million enrolled\u201d refers solely to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s health insurance exchange marketplaces, and completely ignores the law\u2019s Medicaid expansion, which has provided coverage to more people than the exchanges in 31 states and the District of Columbia, which adopted the expansion.\nSen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) has been trotting out this bogus argument for years, most recently on Twitter a few weeks ago. (It\u2019s hard to say whether Cornyn knows better.)\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)\u00a0surely must find this yearning for universal coverage from his Republican colleagues to be utterly heartwarming. He\u2019s got a plan for that!\nBut about that 28 million. That\u2019s how many people the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say lacked health coverage last year, and it amounts to 9 percent of the population, down from 14.4 percent in 2013, the year before the Affordable Care Act\u2019s coverage expansion began. (The Congressional Budget Office pegs this year\u2019s number at 26 million.)\nThose are big numbers, and no one who believes in universal coverage is satisfied that the Affordable Care Act left so many people without help.\nLet\u2019s be clear, though: Mike Pence,\u00a0Tom Price and John Cornyn don\u2019t belong to the group of Americans that believes in universal coverage.\nNor do President Donald Trump,\u00a0House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), or Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). And neither does any member of Congress who voted for the GOP\u2019s American Health Care Act.\nHow do we know? Because that bill would make the number of uninsured much, much bigger. This, presumably, is why Trump reportedly told Republican senators that the House bill is \u201cmean.\u201d\nUnder the legislation the House passed last month \u2015 which the Senate is using as the basis for its legislation \u2015 there would be 51 million uninsured people in the United States by 2026, compared with the 28 million under current law (Obamacare), according to the Congressional Budget Office.\nBy comparison, when the CBO assessed the Affordable Care Act in 2010, it projected the law would shrink the number of Americans without health coverage\u00a0from 51 million to 23 million\u00a0in 2019. After the Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that\u00a0states could refuse the law\u2019s Medicaid expansion, the CBO revised its prediction, saying 29 million would be uninsured in 2019, and 30 million by 2022.\nSo why does a law designed to help people get health coverage leave so many people uninsured?\nIt\u2019s partly by design, because undocumented immigrants deliberately are excluded from the Affordable Care Act\u2019s benefits. It\u2019s partly because there are a lot of people who are eligible for Medicaid coverage or subsidized private health insurance who haven\u2019t signed up. And it\u2019s partly because there are many people who can\u2019t afford or don\u2019t want health insurance, either offered by an employer or via the exchanges, and so they don\u2019t buy it.\nThe Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation created this chart breaking that down, using data from the U.S. Census Bureau:\u00a0\nThe largest group is undocumented immigrants, legally barred from even using their own money to buy health insurance from the exchanges and from enrolling in Medicaid.\nIf Mike Pence wants to change that, he\u2019d find a lot of Democrats\u00a0willing to have that conversation.\nMore than four in 10 of the uninsured are eligible for assistance, but, for whatever reason, aren\u2019t getting it. For some portion of those individuals, it\u2019s because even with financial assistance, they still find the insurance too expensive. Others probably don\u2019t even know that help is available.\u00a0\nIf Tom Price wants to increase aid for poor and middle-income households to buy coverage, and to devote more resources to getting the word out about programs that can help, Democrats would be more than happy to work out a deal.\nThere are more than 2 million people who\u2019d be eligible for Medicaid if they lived in states that took up the Affordable Care Act\u2019s expansion.\nDemocrats would welcome it if John Cornyn pressured his home-state officials in Texas \u2015 which has the highest uninsured rate in the country \u2015 to expand Medicaid.\nAnd then there are the 7.5 million people who either earn too much to qualify for the Affordable Care Act\u2019s tax credits, or can\u2019t get those subsidies because their employers offered them health benefits and they turned them down. It stands to reason that cost is a big reason why these folks are uninsured. So, again, if Pence, Price and Cornyn are so concerned about the plight of these people, they could promote policies that address it.\nInstead, the Republican Party is putting all its weight behind legislation that would\u00a0help far fewer people. Don\u2019t expect Mike Pence to stand in front of a bar graph showing the number of uninsured going up and up and up under the legislation his boss is in such a hurry to sign.", "date": "\n06/14/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/one-of-the-stupidest-anti-obamacare-arguments-is-making-a-comeback_n_59403222e4b09ad4fbe39eb3", "tags": "arguments anti-obamacare coverage making health one comeback act affordable law uninsured million care stupidest"}
