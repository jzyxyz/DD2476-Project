{"title": "U.S.-China Trade Standoff May Be Initial Skirmish in Broader Economic War", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A yearlong trade war between the United States and China is proving to be an initial skirmish in an economic conflict that may persist for decades, as both countries battle for global dominance, stature and wealth.\nProgress toward a trade agreement nearly collapsed this past week, with both sides hardening their bargaining positions. And even if a trade deal is reached, it may do little to resolve tensions between the world\u2019s two largest economies.\nThe United States is increasingly wary of China\u2019s emerging role in the global economy and the tactics it uses to get ahead, including state-sponsored hacking, acquisitions of high-tech companies in the United States and Europe, subsidies to crucial industries and discrimination against foreign companies.\nThe Trump administration has begun trying to limit China\u2019s economic influence in the United States and abroad, warning about China\u2019s ambitions in increasingly stark terms. Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, compared China\u2019s ambitions to Russia and Iran in a speech in London last Wednesday, saying Beijing poses \u201ca new kind of challenge; an authoritarian regime that\u2019s integrated economically into the West in ways that the Soviet Union never was.\u201d\nThe United States has been erecting barriers to limit Chinese investment in American companies, re-examining the kinds of technology that can be exported to China and restricting China\u2019s role in building America\u2019s next-generation telecommunications networks, while also discouraging other countries from using Chinese equipment.\nThe F.B.I. has increased its scrutiny of Chinese researchers in the United States over fears they may be acquiring intellectual secrets. A Justice Department initiative is targeting commercial espionage of American technology, and earlier this year the United States unveiled a sweeping indictment of the Chinese telecom giant Huawei and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, over accusations of stealing trade secrets and evading American sanctions on Iran.\nChina, whose ambition is to dominate industries of the future, is pushing back. A column on Saturday in the Communist Party\u2019s People\u2019s Daily newspaper stated, \u201cThe United States is again waving the club of tariffs after misjudging China\u2019s strength, capacity and will, further escalating trade friction between our two countries.\u201d\nThe piece was written under the pen name Zhong Sheng \u2014 the \u201cvoice of China\u201d \u2014 a name used when the paper publishes comments on foreign affairs that are authoritative.\nRestraining China\u2019s ambitions and methods is a tricky task \u2014 and there is concern that the Trump administration\u2019s effort is creating a new red scare, fueling discrimination against China and its citizens that could ultimately hurt the United States. As many as 30 Chinese professors have had their visas to the United States canceled in the past year, or been put on administrative review, according to Chinese academics and their American counterparts.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got decades of painful negotiating with China ahead,\u201d said David Lampton, a China scholar at Stanford University. Mr. Lampton said a trade deal, if reached, would do little to resolve the bigger conflict. \u201cIt\u2019s just a skirmish in an ongoing battle.\u201d\nChinese negotiators returned to Beijing over the weekend without a trade agreement and with even larger economic barriers between the two countries. The Trump administration raised tariffs on $200 billion in exports on Friday and said it would move ahead with the legal process of taxing another roughly $300 billion of products at the same 25 percent rate.\nThe two countries could yet come to an agreement that opens opportunities for businesses and rolls back the levies they have placed on each other. Both American and Chinese officials said on Friday that they would continue to talk and could meet in Beijing next month. Liu He, China\u2019s vice premier, called the failure to reach a deal \u201cjust a small setback in the talks between two countries,\u201d while Mr. Trump, in a tweet, described the talks as \u201ccandid and constructive.\u201d\nWhile a trade deal could calm some tensions and establish more good will between the two nations, it is unlikely to achieve many of the ambitious goals that the administration has set for itself. Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers, in particular the United States trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, have been focused on what the administration calls China\u2019s practices of \u201ceconomic aggression.\u201d\nBut the administration has struggled to address the immensity of the problems in the text of a trade deal. People close to the talks say that the negotiators appear powerless to force any changes that aren\u2019t in China\u2019s interest.\nMr. Liu, who is leading China\u2019s team in the trade negotiations, hinted at that uphill battle in a video statement released by the official Xinhua news agency.\n\u201cNow both sides have reached consensus in many respects, but frankly there are also areas of disagreement,\u201d he said. \u201cWe believe that these are major matters of principle, and any country has its own important principles \u2014 we can\u2019t make concessions on matters of principle.\u201d\nDespite punishing tariffs already on nearly half of Chinese exports to the United States, Beijing is still resisting many of the most significant changes that the administration seeks. It has been reluctant to roll back subsidies for advanced manufacturing industries or to make public commitments to stop cybertheft.\nInstead, a trade deal between the two countries seems more likely to bring change around the margins \u2014 tens of billions of dollars of soybean purchases, some tariffs lifted and changes to the text of Chinese laws or regulations that the country might ultimately disregard, particularly once another administration occupies the White House.\n\u201cThis is a decades-long endeavor,\u201d said Robert Daly, the director of the Wilson Center\u2019s Kissinger Institute on China and the United States. \u201cThis can\u2019t be waved away over cake at Mar-a-Lago.\u201d\nThe notion that the United States has one last shot to change China\u2019s behavior is held by an array of people on both sides of the political spectrum. But it is an aggressive notion of American power to upend a rival system that has delivered prosperity for its people and put China on course to be the world\u2019s largest economy.\nMany in China see the United States as a declining power bent on enforcing its will on a world that no longer cowers before its hegemonic might. The troubles in American democracy and the long economic slump after 2008 persuaded many in China that its instincts to chart its own course were correct. In the eyes of many Chinese, their country is simply reclaiming its historic status as a dominant regional power in Asia.\nIt has also projected power across Asia, Africa and elsewhere while the United States has, on many fronts, retreated from its post-World War II commitment to the global order. But it has done so with little application of military force, in sharp contrast to what many in China see as American militarism.\nMany in China have sought to avoid a trade conflict, which could have a larger impact on their economy than the United States\u2019. But they have long thought the United States would have a difficult time accepting a true peer in economic, technology and military power, so consider the management of conflict with the United States to be an inevitable result of their own rise.\nWhile the Trump administration accused China of breaking a trade deal, China\u2019s resistance to the emerging terms stemmed from its belief that the United States was asking too much and offering too little in return. Many of the changes the United States seeks would limit what Chinese officials regard as a tried-and-true approach of using tens of billions of dollars from state-owned banks and government investment funds to turn previously small industries like car production or solar panel manufacturing into the largest industries of their kind in the world.\nAnd the Chinese view some of the Trump administration\u2019s demands as infringing on their sovereignty and giving America too much power over their economy \u2014 including requiring the country to codify changes through legislation in the National People\u2019s Congress. To the increasingly nationalistic public in China, the American requests are reminiscent of 19th century history of unequal treaties forced on the country by foreign powers.\nMr. Trump on Saturday suggested China was simply delaying a deal in the hopes that a Democrat would win election in 2020 and continued his pugilistic approach, saying \u201cthe deal will become far worse for them if it has to be negotiated in my second term. Would be wise for them to act now, but love collecting BIG TARIFFS!\u201d\nIn the United States, China\u2019s unwillingness to bow to America\u2019s demands is uniting lawmakers like the Democratic Senate leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, and Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida.\nThat is a significant shift from the prevailing view in the United States since the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 that close economic engagement with China would produce an increasingly democratic country that would be closely tied to an international economic order founded mainly on Western liberal ideals.\nThat has not happened.\nChina has indeed grown in prosperity, leaping into the ranks of what the World Bank defines as upper-middle income countries. Its economy is now bigger than any other country except the United States. Its manufacturing sector is now bigger than those of the United States, Germany and South Korea combined.\nBut in the last five years, China has veered toward increasingly repressive authoritarianism at home and a rapid military buildup. The State Department estimates that Beijing has put 800,000 to two million Muslims in hastily built internment camps ringed with barbed wire in northwestern China. The Chinese government has built an archipelago of air bases on artificial islands in the South China Sea in between Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. And China now has the world\u2019s largest navy and has conducted military exercises as far away as East Africa and the Baltic Sea.\nOn the economic front, the competition is even fiercer. Trump administration officials warn that China is trying to dominate the global 5G infrastructure that will be the basis for future mobile communications and is competing to set other technological standards that will determine which global companies win.\nChina is extending low-cost loans and building infrastructure around the globe through its One Belt, One Road program, which critics warn is making poorer countries beholden to China. It is out-investing the United States in some high-tech industries, and is gaining dominance in certain segments, like mobile payment, new energy vehicles and areas of artificial intelligence.\nWhile American companies have long hankered for access to China\u2019s growing market, their position has begun to shift as they see China\u2019s practices and treatment of foreign companies. A survey released by the American Chamber of Commerce in China in February showed that the majority of its members favored retaining tariffs on Chinese goods while trade negotiations continued.\nChina\u2019s own experts say that the Beijing leadership has been caught off guard by the pace of change in American perceptions of Sino-American relations.\n\u201cEven if there is some kind of agreement between Xi and Trump, in the long run the strategic bilateral relationship is already in trouble,\u201d said Zhang Jian, a professor in the School of Government at Peking University. \u201cThere is no coming back, even if there is a deal.\u201d", "date": "May 11, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/11/world/asia/us-china-trade-war.html", "tags": "american administration may initial skirmish standoff china broader united states \u201d economic war trade chinese many u.s.-china"}
