{"title": "\u2018Billy Elliot\u2019 Musical Branded Gay Propaganda in Hungary; Cancellations Follow", "content": "The Hungarian State Opera on Thursday canceled over a dozen performances of the musical \u201cBilly Elliot,\u201d after a newspaper columnist accused the production of being \u201cgay propaganda.\u201d\nThe award-winning musical about an English coal miner\u2019s son who discovers a taste for ballet opened at the opera company in 2016 to critical acclaim, and was even credited with inspiring fresh talent to train in the nation\u2019s top ballet school.\nBut, before a revival of the show began its summer run in Budapest, an article on June 1 in the pro-government daily newspaper Magyar Idok accused the production of corrupting young people.\nZsofia N. Horvath said that the musical\u2019s message of \u201cDare to be yourself\u201d referred \u201cof course\u201d to being gay.\n\u201cHow can such an important national institution as the opera go against the objectives of the state and use a performance made for young people around 10, at their most fragile age, for such pointed and unrestrained gay propaganda?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cPromoting homosexuality cannot be a national objective in a situation where the population is already aging and decreasing, and our nation is threatened by foreign invasion,\u201d she added.\nShe said the Hungarian government promoted the family, but that \u201cBilly Elliot\u201d encouraged young people to take a different direction. Perhaps they \u201cwouldn\u2019t have taken this direction on their own,\u201d she added.\nOthers in the pro-government media followed Ms. Horvath\u2019s lead and condemned the show.\nThe director of the Hungarian State Opera, Szilveszter Okovacs, replied on June 2 in an article in the same newspaper. \u201cJust because something that is an undeniable part of life appears onstage at the opera, it doesn\u2019t mean we are promoting it,\u201d he wrote in defense of the production.\nThe Hungarian State Opera announced the cancellation of 15 shows on Thursday. In an email on Friday, Mr. Okovacs said he decided to cancel them because of Ms. Horvath\u2019s attack on the production, which had caused an unprecedented fall in audience numbers. Other performances of the production are to go ahead as planned.\nThe newspaper Magyar Idok is known as an unofficial organ of Prime Minister Viktor Orban\u2019s nationalist government. It routinely accuses and shames public figures who act or speak against the government.\nSince its election in 2010, Mr. Orban\u2019s government has worked to reshape Hungary\u2019s culture so that it fits with his signature brand of nationalism and what he calls \u201cilliberal democracy,\u201d which rejects western liberalism and its values.\nMr. Orban is known for his populist ideology, for his staunch stance against migration and for stigmatizing sections of the population, like the homeless or those aiding migrants. He has not criticized homosexuality himself, but homophobic insults go mostly unsanctioned in public speech and conservative, government-friendly personalities have spoken out against what they call the tyranny of political correctness and the promotion of homosexuality.\nTo Noemi Herczog, a theater critic for Elet es Irodalom, a literary review, the exchange of articles between the columnist and the opera director in Magyar Idok recalled the atmosphere of Hungary\u2019s communist past.\n\u201cIt summons the same feelings,\u201d she said in a telephone interview. \u201cAnd people are now talking about censorship and how this column was written on command.\u201d\nMs. Herczog added, however, that it was still possible to present diverse political positions onstage in Hungary\u2019s theaters, even in large ones funded by the state.\nMr. Okovacs said that the media reaction was not limiting his artistic work, nor, he said, did he expect it to do so in the future.\n\u201c \u2018Be yourself\u2019 is just as much of a general and widely accepted principle of our culture as \u2018Be free\u2019 or \u2018Don\u2019t be afraid,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cThe latter is from Jesus and was the motto of Pope John Paul II, the Polish pope. These all have their place in every democracy.\u201d", "date": "June 22, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/22/theater/hungary-billy-elliot.html", "tags": "branded \u2018 musical propaganda hungary cancellations production \u201d billy elliot state hungarian opera government newspaper follow gay"}
