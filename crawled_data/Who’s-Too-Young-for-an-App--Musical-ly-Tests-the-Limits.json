{"title": "Who\u2019s Too Young for an App? Musical.ly Tests the Limits", "content": "In the folklore of the start-up world, few figures loom larger than the teenager. Teenagers see the future, set trends and spend money, or compel parents to spend it for them. Their behavior has become an obsession for entrepreneurs.\nThis would seem to bode well for Musical.ly, an app that is young in every sense of the word. The Shanghai-based company founded in 2014 claims over 100 million users, most of whom, the company says, are in the 13-20 age bracket. In August, the company teamed up with MTV for a promotion tied to the Video Music Awards.\nWhat is striking about the app, though, is how many of its users appear to be even younger than that. Musical.ly hasn\u2019t just found the coveted teenage audience \u2014 it may have gone lower. And it points to a growing tension between younger users, technology companies, and the norms and laws that regulate them both.\nThe app encourages a youthful audience in subtle and obvious ways. It lets users create short videos in which they can lip-sync, dance or goof around to popular songs, movie scenes and other audio sources, and then post the videos to an Instagram-style feed. Its featured feed includes stars popular with young listeners, including Ariana Grande and Selena Gomez, as well as lesser-known talent and social media personalities who have crossed over from services like Vine. And its tool for posting videos includes an entire category for songs from Disney films and TV shows.\nThe app does not collect or show the age of its users, but some of its top-ranked users, whose posts routinely collect millions of likes, called hearts, appear from their videos and profile photos to be in grade school. Until recently, the app had a feature that suggested users to follow based on their location. In New York, that feature revealed a list composed largely not just of teenagers, but of children.\n\u201cThis is no question the youngest social network we\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said Gary Vaynerchuk, the chief executive of VaynerMedia, an advertising agency that focuses on social media. Mr. Vaynerchuk, who has helped clients produce campaigns for the platform, said he first spotted the app in the iTunes App Store charts, and through Musical.ly videos reposted to other services like Instagram.\n\u201cI would say that Snapchat and Instagram, they skew a little bit young,\u201d he said. But with Musical.ly, \u201cyou\u2019re talking about first, second, third grade.\u201d\nThis puts Musical.ly in a strange position. Websites and online service operators that target users under 13 must meet federal requirements regarding the collection and sharing of personal information, which is defined broadly to include names, photos or videos, or persistent identifiers, such as user names. The restrictions are part of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Rule, often called Coppa, enacted by the Federal Trade Commission.\nLike most social networks that operate in America, Musical.ly says in its terms of service that it prohibits users under the age of 13. But the app doesn\u2019t collect age information about its users, a convention often used by networks that, at least anecdotally, are widely used by children. (Those networks that do ask for an age, like Facebook, tend to take the user\u2019s word for it.)\n\u201cThe approach taken by most operators is to avoid triggering Coppa \u2014 to claim ignorance,\u201d said Denise G. Tayloe, chief executive of Privo, a company that assists online services with Coppa compliance. Enforcement is both difficult and relatively rare; the rule neither requires social platforms to screen for age, nor holds companies accountable for users\u2019 reporting false ages.\nAccording to a spokesman, the F.T.C., as a law enforcement agency, cannot comment publicly about individual companies. In an email, the agency said, \u201cWe support the development of robust, easy-to-use mechanisms companies that collect kids\u2019 personal information can use to seek the parents\u2019 consent.\u201d\nServices that are more openly marketed toward children often stringently adhere to Coppa\u2019s privacy rules. Vine Kids, for example, is a limited and largely passive service with no user names or video posting capabilities; similarly, YouTube Kids is essentially an app full of streaming children\u2019s programming, walled off from the rest of YouTube\u2019s ecosystem. In contrast, Musical.ly, like Snapchat or Instagram, is a full-functioning social network, popular with young people but not openly marketed to them.\nSuch discussions about privacy can feel strained against the backdrop of technological change. The first version of Coppa became law in 1998, almost a decade before the iPhone was introduced. Last year, the research firm Influence Central said that, on average, parents who give their children smartphones do so at age 12. And once they have a phone, they get apps.\nIn a study of the law published in 2011 by the academic journal First Monday, researchers suggested that Coppa created intractable issues. To remain compliant, tech companies either cut off young users or claimed ignorance of their presence, while parents, for whom the law is meant to provide guidance and comfort, often ended up helping their children circumvent sign-up rules. Increasing the current style of enforcement, the report concluded, would only encourage firms to \u201cfocus on denying access rather than providing privacy protection or cooperating with parents.\u201d\nIn short, children are using their smartphones much like the rest of us, whether or not they are comprehensively addressed by regulations or by broader cultural conventions.\nAlex Hofmann, president of Musical.ly, said the company tries to be mindful of its popularity with younger users. \u201cOne of the differences to other apps,\u201d he said, \u201cis that we don\u2019t only talk to the musers\u201d \u2014 the company\u2019s term for users \u2014 \u201cwe talk to the parents.\u201d\nHe keeps close counsel with a network of a few dozen top users, and some of their families, and frequently asks for feedback from both regarding everything from user safety to new features. (The company\u2019s support page contains an entire section directed toward parents \u2014 one that notes the app is \u201cintended for 13+ only.\u201d)\nUltimately, Mr. Hofmann said, he expects the app to diversify its audience. \u201cWe really see ourselves as a real social network, and as a network for different age groups,\u201d he said.\nFor now, the company will have to navigate a peculiar if widely envied situation \u2014 capitalizing on its apparent popularity with an audience that it cannot fully acknowledge, watched over by wary but increasingly complicit parents.\n\u201cA year ago, there was basically nobody who was 40 years old on Snapchat,\u201d Mr. Vaynerchuk said. \u201cIf Musical.ly can hold on, they will age up.\u201d\nAsked whether an app attracting such a young audience might be a liability, he cast the matter of children using social apps less as an argument than as an inevitability. Children are using these apps, he said. And besides, in the beginning, it was the children who chose Musical.ly, not the other way around.\nWhat remains to be seen, he said, is whether any particular service is too much, too soon \u2014 something that is largely out of the company\u2019s hands.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no campaign, there\u2019s no money to be thrown at it, it will just become something you get used to,\u201d Mr. Vaynerchuk said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to address. This is about social norms.\u201d", "date": "Sept. 16, 2016", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/17/business/media/a-social-network-frequented-by-children-tests-the-limits-of-online-regulation.html", "tags": "users company young \u201d app social tests musical.ly limits children age"}
