{"title": "US carmakers hit by tariffs disputes", "content": "Three major automakers have warned that changes to trade policies are hurting performance.\nFord and General Motors lowered profit forecasts for 2018, citing higher steel and aluminium prices caused by new US tariffs.\nFiat Chrysler also slashed its 2018 revenue outlook, after sales in China slumped as buyers postponed purchases in anticipation of lower car tariffs.\nShares in all three companies fell after they reported results.\nGeneral Motors shares ended the day about 5% lower, while Fiat Chrysler shares sank about 11%. \nShares in Ford, which reported its earnings to investors results later in the day, dropped about 4% in after hours trade.\nFord said tariffs, including on steel and aluminium, could cost it up to $1.6bn (\u00a31.2bn), while General Motors said higher metals prices would add about $600m-$700m to costs.\nGeneral Motors chief executive Mary Barra said the firm had anticipated higher costs this year, but \"the challenge has become significantly greater than we expected\".\nAt Fiat Chrysler, executives said fixed price contracts have helped to shield it from some of the impact of higher metals prices, but they warned those expenses would rise in 2019.\nMs Barra said the firm had been in frequent contact with the White House about how trade policies would affect its business.\nIn addition to the metals tariffs, the Trump administration is considering placing new duties on foreign vehicles and car parts.\nCarmakers are also grappling with questions about the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta).\nGeneral Motors said it is also worried that trade tensions could eventually put buyers in China off American brands. China is GM's biggest market after North America. \n\"We are in a very uncertain and volatile environment at this time,\" said GM chief financial officer Chuck Stevens.\nThe warnings came amid disappointing quarterly results.\nFord revenues slipped by 2.3% to $38.9bn, while profits nearly halved as sales in China fell and it halted some production due to a fire at a key parts supplier.\nAt GM, sales and revenue fell almost 1% to $36.8bn, despite gains in the US, where the number of vehicles sold to dealerships increased by 4.6% amid increased demand for pickup trucks.\nThe firm reported profit of about $2.4bn, down roughly 2.8% year-on-year.\nFiat Chrysler revenue increased 4% in the quarter to almost 29bn euros, but profits tumbled by 35%.\nThe firm said it expected sales in China to rebound, but faced future challenges as new emissions rules in the country come into effect.", "date": "26 July 2018", "href": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44957350", "tags": "us disputes carmakers china fiat hit ford higher trade chrysler general tariffs motors"}
