{"title": "Within Minutes Of Notre Dame Cathedral Fire, Conspiracies Reigned", "content": "Minutes after a fire began to engulf the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, Fox News anchor Shep Smith interviewed a man he described as a \u201cFrench elected official\u201d who immediately characterized the blaze as \u201cthe French 9/11\u201d and said only the \u201cpolitically correct will tell you that it\u2019s probably an accident.\u201d\nActual French officials are still early in the process of determining the exact cause of the fire \u2015 but that didn\u2019t stop America\u2019s most-watched cable TV news source from amplifying the fantasies of a conspiracy theorist.\nAs it turns out, Smith\u2019s guest, Philippe Karsenty, is a media analyst and conspiracy theorist who was previously convicted of defamation for making false accusations against a French TV network. Although Karsenty\u2019s website claims he is the deputy mayor of the city of Neuilly, he hasn\u2019t held that office in years. In fact, Karsenty now holds an opposition seat on the town\u2019s municipal council, Le HuffPost reported.\nSmith cut him off, but the damage was done.\nInadvertently or otherwise, Fox News had joined a conspiracy chorus that hummed loudly in the minutes after the fire broke out.\nThose looking to social media for answers would find white nationalists like Faith Goldy or Infowars writer Paul Joseph Watson claiming that the fire was deliberate.\nThey\u2019d find far-right chuds like Twitter user @Partisangirl declaring matter-of-factly, to 112,000 followers, that French President Emmanuel Macron \u201chas probably set fire to Notre Dame to try and make the yellow vests look bad,\u201d referring to the protesters who have beleaguered his regime of late.\nOfficials initially said that the fire was \u201cpotentially linked\u201d to renovation\u00a0work in the building.\nThose who sought out news on YouTube were met with videos of the Sept. 11 terror attacks. On Twitter, white nationalist Richard Spencer hoped that the fire \u201cserves to spur the White man into action.\u201d Noted Islamophobe Pam Gellar opined that Islam had something to do with it.\nAnd of course, the QAnon adherents had to weigh in. Some of the folks who insist pedophiles have long controlled the U.S. government used a shotgun approach and pushed any and every conspiracy theory at once: It\u2019s British Prime Minister Theresa May; it\u2019s former first lady Michelle Obama; it\u2019s Pope Francis himself, \u201cburning evidence\u201d of \u201critual sacrifice\u201d of children.\nConspiracy theories abound after most crises, regurgitated by prominent voices and often online. Mass shootings are called \u201cfalse flag\u201d operations\u00a0by loud people like Infowars host Alex Jones. QAnon followers cried hoax when bombs were sent to top Democrats and others last year. President Donald Trump himself has been criticized for pushing conspiracy theories about a number of groups, including immigrants on the southern border and Muslims.\nSuch mindless speculation is often dangerous and can lead to more violence.\u00a0The fire that razed the Notre Dame Cathedral seemed to bring all of these conspiracy theories into the same room, all at once \u2015 and for a time, that noise was louder than any other.\nCORRECTION:\u00a0A previous version of this story stated Karsenty doesn\u2019t currently hold an elected position. He is a member of the town municipal council in Neuilly.", "date": "\n04/15/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/notre-dame-cathedral-fire-conspiracy-theories_n_5cb4ce57e4b098b9a2d825c7", "tags": "minutes fire within news smith notre reigned conspiracies \u201d cathedral dame karsenty french conspiracy"}
