{"title": "A Farmer\u2019s Tough Year on the Trade War\u2019s Kansas Front", "content": "Justin Knopf finished harvesting soybeans as November\u2019s first snowflakes started falling on his fields in Gypsum, Kan. Then he did what thousands of farmers throughout the grain belt are doing: He got an application for some of the $12 billion in federal emergency relief intended to blunt the economic fallout from President Trump\u2019s trade policy brinkmanship.\nChina, the biggest buyer of American soybeans, all but stopped purchases after the White House imposed tariffs this summer and set a retaliatory spiral in motion. The pronouncements and maneuvers in world capitals have reverberated through the kitchens and living rooms of farmers, who were targets in part because they are big exporters and core supporters of Mr. Trump.\n\u201cSome say enough already \u2014 it\u2019s a big gamble and the timing is horrible for us to be messing with trade,\u201d Mr. Knopf said. \u201cOther farmers are incredibly excited about what the administration is doing on trade and truly believe they\u2019ll come up with a better deal for us long term. I\u2019m probably somewhere in the middle. I\u2019m cautiously hopeful.\u201d\nThe past year has tested the patience and resilience of Mr. Knopf, 40, who lives on the farm with his wife, Lindsey, and three children. For now, he is waiting to see what happens when Mr. Trump and President Xi Jinping of China meet at the Group of 20 summit meeting in Argentina on Friday and Saturday before deciding what to do with the rest of his soybean harvest.\nHere\u2019s what the past four seasons have been like for Mr. Knopf.\nFALL 2017\nTrade frictions with China mounted through most of last year, but when Mr. Trump traveled to Beijing in November, the tone changed. The president piled praise on Mr. Xi, and blamed the United States for inequitable trade deals. It looked as if relations were warming, and the price of soybeans was floating around $9.90 a bushel.\nOn the farm, Mr. Knopf was deciding how many acres of soybeans, sorghum and corn to plant in the spring to take advantage of an early-order discount for seed. As a no-till farmer, he diversifies and rotates crops to create healthier soil, instead of plowing and relying heavily on pesticides. \nThose considerations play an important role in his crop choices, but so do calculations about what looks as if it will fetch the best price over the next year. Soybeans seemed to promise a better return, so Mr. Knopf went ahead with increasing his soybean acreage.\nWINTER 2018\nFor years, family farmers have struggled with limp prices, tight credit and more extreme weather.  \u201cTrade is just one more thing to worry about,\u201d Mr. Knopf said.\nTensions heated up in January and February. Two weeks after Mr. Trump placed new tariffs on washing machines and solar panels, Chinese officials began an anti-dumping inquiry into American exports of sorghum. \nMr. Knopf said China\u2019s announcement was \u201cwhen the reality really sank in that this trade war was going to have a significant impact on my farm here in the middle of central Kansas.\u201d\n\u201cOur local price that day dropped by \u2014 I believe it was 80 cents,\u201d he said. \u201cJust that one announcement from China decreased my potential revenue by 20 percent in one day.\u201d\n Soon, though, the sorghum and soybean prices rebounded.\nSPRING 2018 \nThe price of soybeans largely stayed above $10 a bushel \u2014 what Mr. Knopf would characterize as a \u201cnot horrible, not fantastic\" price \u2014 through May. Hopes for a deal were further bolstered when the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said on May 20 that \u201cwe\u2019re putting the trade war on hold.\u201d \nLess than two weeks later, though, Mr. Trump said he was moving ahead with a plan to impose 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion worth of imported Chinese goods within the next month. China retaliated and identified $50 billion worth of American goods for a 25 percent tariff. \nMr. Knopf had decided to reduce his corn and sorghum acreage because soybean prices looked favorable. He had finished planting corn and was halfway through his soybean fields when prices started sinking. \u201cAll of a sudden, things have changed pretty quickly,\u201d he said.\nHe could have sold part or all of his spring crops in advance, but rain had been sparse. \u201cI wasn\u2019t in a good mood to sell before I had a better picture of what we had planted and if the crop was off to a good start,\u201d he said.\nBy waiting, Mr. Knopf was betting that the price of soybeans would not drop too much. But from late May to mid-June, it went from $10.41 a bushel to $8.95. Now, he had a different reason to hold off.\n\u201cI will tell you from an emotional standpoint, it\u2019s hard to sell or write a contract when something has just taken a big plunge,\u201d Mr. Knopf said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to sell just after the price falls, so I was getting paralyzed.\u201d \nSUMMER 2018 \nWashington and Beijing seesawed through a set of punishing threats and tariffs. The first China-specific tariffs went into effect on July 6. Beijing responded by imposing tariffs on American products, including soybeans. By mid-July the price sank to $8.18 a bushel, the lowest in nearly a decade. At the same time, Midwestern farmers were contending with a drought.\n\u201cThis affects my family each day,\u201d Mr. Knopf said. \u201cSome days, I just think I need to \u2014 golly, I need to trust what he\u2019s doing,\u201d he said of the president. \u201cOther days, I think, \u2018Golly, I wish this would be over.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cThe president keeps calling us farmers great patriots and keeps asking us to trust him and says that we\u2019re going to end up with a better deal,\u201d Mr. Knopf said. \u201cThat is in the back of farmers\u2019 minds. But at the same time, we can only do this for so long.\u201d\nMr. Trump sent out an early-morning Twitter post on July 24 that \u201cTariffs are the greatest!\u201d\nLater that day, the administration announced $12 billion in emergency relief for farmers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice that the administration has recognized that this is having an impact on our local pricing,\u201d Mr. Knopf said. \u201cOn the other hand, any farmer will tell you we\u2019d much rather have markets that are open and fair.\u201d \nOn Aug. 1, Mr. Knopf sold 2,000 bushels of soybeans at the local cash price of $8.25 a bushel. \u201cI remember thinking \u2018O.K., prices have come back some, at least we\u2019re off the lows, although they\u2019re not what they were,\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cI would have liked to have done much more, but I wasn\u2019t sure how many bushels we were going to raise. We were on the verge of almost having areas in the field begin to die because of the drought.\u201d \nThe next day, tensions between China and the United States rose again, with virtually no break through most of September. On Sept. 18, after a list of Chinese goods was drawn up for a new tariff, soybeans fell to $8.14 a bushel.\nIn Kansas, there had been some good news. Rain. Because of the weather, Mr. Knopf said, \u201cI realized I\u2019m going to raise an above-average crop.\u201d But prices remained low, so he held off selling more soybeans. \nFALL 2018 \nAt a United Nations Security Council session on Sept. 24, Mr. Trump accused the Chinese of trying to interfere in the midterm elections. By the time this cycle of threats, counterthreats and complaints to the World Trade Organization concluded, the United States had applied tariffs to $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, and China had imposed tariffs on $110 billion worth of American goods, including soybeans. \nIn the Kansas fields, rain delayed the start of the harvest until the first week in October. Mr. Knopf noticed that the local price he could get for his soybean crop was diverging more and more from the benchmark price on the Chicago Board of Trade, further depressing his return. So on Oct. 15, he sold 3,000 bushels at $7.70. \nA couple of weeks later, with the midterm elections a few days away, Mr. Trump offered some hope about an agreement at a meeting with Mr. Xi at the end of November. \nThe same day that Mr. Trump sent that soothing signal, Mr. Knopf decided to sell another 5,000 bushels while prices remained steady. A couple of days later, he harvested the last of the soybeans, but chose to store the final batch \u2014 roughly 4,500 bushels \u2014 at a grain elevator. He is waiting to see if the Trump-Xi meeting produces a positive announcement that could lift prices. \nHe knows there\u2019s a risk: \u201cIf nothing comes out of the G-20 summit and prices fall, I will be penalized for waiting.\u201d In any case, he hopes to have an acceptable price by the end of the year, so as to avoid further storage costs. That is also when the United States plans a further increase in tariffs on Chinese goods. \nThere is no formula for managing the uncertainty. Farmers\u2019 responses vary widely. \n\u201cEveryone will have a different take,\u201d Mr. Knopf explained. \u201cSome will use market advisory services. Some depend on political persuasion, how much he trusts or doesn\u2019t trust what this administration is promising to deliver. There\u2019s also the business reality of cash flow.\u201d\nFor example, Joe Kejr, Mr. Knopf\u2019s neighbor and another no-till farmer, can store his soybeans at no cost because he has a grain elevator. He is betting that Brazil \u2014 a big soybean supplier to China since the tariffs were imposed \u2014 will be running out of its inventory and prices will rise by spring. \nBoth Mr. Kejr and Mr. Knopf are taking part in the emergency relief program, which amounts to 82.5 cents a bushel for soybeans. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a Band-Aid effect, trying to heal a little bit of the wound,\u201d Mr. Kejr said. \u201cAll of us would just as soon not have the government paying or us needing that type of assistance.\u201d\nA fifth-generation farmer, Mr. Knopf has successfully managed the whammy of trade tussles, low prices, hard-to-get credit and weather fluctuations. Not everyone has been so fortunate. Recent analyses by the Federal Reserve Banks of both Kansas City and Minneapolis found the combined stresses threatened the survival of some farms. \nLOOKING AHEAD\n\u201cThere is more uncertainty now with trade than since I\u2019ve been farming, 18 years ago,\u201d said Mr. Knopf. \u201cFor my generation, this is the first and most extreme trade thing we\u2019ve been through.\u201d\nOver the last six months, he has become more skeptical of the president\u2019s policies. In early June, he said: \u201cWe\u2019re willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. It\u2019s a different approach \u2014 he\u2019s changing things up. Let\u2019s give it a try.\u201d\nThis week, Mr. Knopf sounded a darker tone: \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating. We haven\u2019t seen a lot of progress.\u201d Chinese tariffs on soybeans have reduced farmers\u2019 incomes, but American tariffs on foreign steel have significantly raised the costs of their machinery and equipment. \u201cWe\u2019re on the wrong end of it on both sides,\u201d he said.\nThe growing cycle has started again, and Mr. Knopf is planning next year\u2019s crop. The meeting this week between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi, he said, is \u201creally important to farmers who are already beginning to think about and make plans for spring.\u201d \nWithout an accord by planting season, \u201cI think the mood is going to sour pretty quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cPatience will run out.\u201d", "date": "Nov. 29, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/business/economy/farmer-trade-tariffs.html", "tags": "tough knopf kansas \u201c farmers price war front trade year soybeans tariffs farmer"}
