{"title": "Trump's Biggest Win In 2017- His Judicial Confirmations-", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2015 Almost a year into his job, President Donald Trump\u2019s biggest accomplishment isn\u2019t any specific legislation that\u2019s passed or executive action he\u2019s taken. It\u2019s how he\u2019s reshaped the courts.\nTrump is breaking records with his judicial confirmations. The Senate voted Thursday to confirm James Ho to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit,\u00a0which bumps the number of Trump\u2019s nominees approved for the circuit courts to 12. That\u2019s more than any president has confirmed in their first year in office since the circuit courts were created in 1891. He surpassed Presidents Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy, who had 11 circuit court judges confirmed in their first year. For President Barack Obama, the number was just three.\nRepublicans didn\u2019t waste time celebrating the achievement.\nThis is in addition to the Senate confirming Trump\u2019s Supreme Court pick, Neil Gorsuch, and six of his district court nominees.\nThe circuit court judges, in particular, will have a tremendous effect on the way the nation\u2019s laws are interpreted. These are lifetime seats on courts one level below the U.S. Supreme Court, which only hears between 100-150 of the more than 7,000 appeals cases it is asked to review by circuit courts. That means circuit courts are often the final word in thousands of cases.\nThere\u2019s a clear theme to the president\u2019s judges, too: many are young, conservative, and opposed to abortion and LGBTQ rights.\nLet\u2019s meet some of them!\nAmy Coney Barrett, 45, is now on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit. She previously\u00a0questioned the precedent of the Roe v. Wade\u00a0abortion rights ruling, and condemned the birth control benefit under the Affordable Care Act as \u201ca grave infringement on religious liberty.\u201d She also took a speaking fee from the Alliance Defending Freedom, a nonprofit that\u2019s defended forced sterilization for transgender people and has been dubbed a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.\nJohn Bush, 52, is now on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit. He\u2019s referred to\u00a0abortion to slavery as \u201cthe two greatest tragedies in our country.\u201d He has also said he strongly disagrees with same-sex marriage, mocked climate change and proclaimed \u201cthe witch is dead\u201d when he thought the Affordable Care Act might not be enacted.\nKevin Newsom, 44, is now on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit. He wrote a 2000 law review article equating the rationale of Roe v. Wade to Dred Scott v. Sandford, the 1857 decision upholding slavery. He also argued in a 2005 article for the Federalist Society, a right-wing legal organization that is behind many of Trump\u2019s court picks, that Title IX does not protect people who face retaliation for reporting gender discrimination. The Supreme Court later rejected that position.\u00a0\nPerhaps the most alarming of Trump\u2019s judges is Leonard Steven Grasz, confirmed this week to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit. He earned a rare and unanimous \u201cnot qualified\u201d rating by the American Bar Association after his colleagues essentially described him as a real jerk who can\u2019t separate his advocacy from his role as a judge on issues like abortion and LGBTQ issues.\nAmong other things, Grasz, 56, pushed to amend the Omaha City Charter in 2013 to let employers discriminate against LGBTQ people, and he served on a nonprofit board that backed so-called conversion therapy for LGBTQ kids. In a 1999 article, he argued that lower courts should be able to overrule Supreme Court decisions on abortion rights because \u201cabortion jurisprudence is, to a significant extent, a word game.\u201d\nMost people don\u2019t pay much attention to how senators vote on judicial nominees. But a closer look shows that some in both parties are voting to confirm lifetime federal judges with records that clash with policy positions they supposedly support.\nFor example, Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine are pro-choice and often tout their support for Planned Parenthood. They\u00a0both voted\u00a0for Grasz.\nOr, look at Ho. He donated thousands of pro bono hours to First Liberty Institute, a conservative legal group that takes up cases opposing LGBTQ rights. Their clients include the owners of Sweet Cakes, an Oregon bakery fined for refusing to serve a lesbian couple, and a newspaper editor fired for writing a post condemning the \u201cLGBTQXYZ crowd and the Gaystapo\u201d for trying to \u201cmake their sinful nature right with God.\u201d\nWho voted for him Thursday? Collins, Murkowski and Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), all of whom have advocated for LGBTQ rights. Three Senate Democrats voted for Ho as well \u2015 Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Claire McCaskill of Missouri.\nIn any event, there\u2019s not much Democrats can do to block Trump\u2019s judicial nominees, save for invoking\u00a0an obscure Senate Judiciary Committee rule that lets them hold up nominees from their home states. They can also try public shaming.\nCarl Tobias, a University of Richmond law professor and expert on judicial nominations, said what stands out the most to him this year is the sloppy process by which Republicans rushed through judicial nominees.\nThe White House has not been meaningfully consulting with senators before announcing nominees, he said, and Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa)\u00a0has been packing hearings with multiple circuit court nominees. That\u2019s turned hearings into \u201ca farce,\u201d\u00a0he said, as committee members, particularly Democrats,\u00a0are left with little time to prepare questions and even less time to probe people about to become lifetime federal judges.\n\u201cThe increasingly partisan and politicized processes undermine respect for the White House, the Senate and the courts, making judges appear to be politicians in robes,\u201d lamented Tobias. \u201cThese phenomena are detrimental to separation of powers and the health of the republic.\u201d", "date": "\n12/14/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-judicial-nominations_n_5a32ddd9e4b0ff955ad14bad", "tags": "judicial win court u.s. \u201d trump confirmations- circuit courts biggest nominees judges appeals"}
