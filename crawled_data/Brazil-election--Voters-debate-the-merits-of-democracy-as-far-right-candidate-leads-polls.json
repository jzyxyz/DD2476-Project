{"title": "Brazil election: Voters debate the merits of democracy as far-right candidate leads polls", "content": "Should Brazil stick to democracy, or not? Unlikely as it might seem to outsiders, this has been a key debating point as Latin America's largest country edges towards its election. \nWith just two days to go, a new survey by Datafolha suggests 69% of Brazilians believe democracy is the best way forward. \nHowever, some are concerned that leading candidate Jair Bolsonaro - a far-right former army captain - will threaten this path. \nHe has talked positively of the military junta which ruled the country from 1964 to 1985, and promised to fill his cabinet with generals. \n\"I'm in favour of a dictatorship!\" he said boldly in a 1993 speech, Reuters news agency reports. \"We will never resolve grave national problems with this irresponsible democracy!\" \nCurrent polling has him on a comfortable 35%, which is set to take him into the second round where he is likely to meet left-wing Fernando Haddad, standing for the  Workers' Party (PT).\nIn the candidates' final meeting on Thursday night, the future of the democracy was addressed. \nMr Bolsonaro did not take part, under doctors' orders. He was stabbed at a campaign rally in September and was only released from hospital last weekend. \nHowever, he did manage to give a television interview to a channel that has given him favourable coverage. It was aired simultaneously and his critics said it was a move to avoid being challenged.    \nGuilherme Boulos, a candidate for the Socialism and Liberty party, used the debate to send a warning to viewers. \n\"[The dictatorship] was 30 years ago now, but I think we have never been so close to what happened back then...\" he said. \"This is always how it starts out: guns, sorting things out with violence, human lives worth nothing.\" \nHe has vowed to get tough on crime after a spike in the homicide rate. He has said he will loosen gun laws so citizens can protect themselves.  \nHis approval rating has climbed and he picked up even more supporters after he was attacked. Datafolha's polling suggests he is also the current leading choice for young people and Brazilian women, even though he is known for having made misogynist, racist and homophobic comments.\nPolling companies give him roughly a 30% chance of winning the race outright, according to Reuters news agency. \nHis supporters hope more voters might be silently in his camp but are not making their intentions known to pollsters.  \nHowever, most analysts believe he will end up in the 28 October run-off, and current projections suggest his likely run-off with Mr Haddad is too close to call.\nMr Haddad has 22% support for the first round. \nDespite being former mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo, he is largely unknown in many parts of the vast country. He was only named as the candidate for just over three weeks before election day. The party was pinning its hopes on ex-President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva but he was banned from standing as he is serving prison time for corruption convictions. \nA criminal investigation has seen a number of Brazilian politicians jailed for corruption, including Lula and various other PT leaders, losing the party many voters.", "date": "5 October 2018", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-45757937", "tags": "country election candidate debate polling voters party leads merits democracy brazil polls current haddad far-right however"}
