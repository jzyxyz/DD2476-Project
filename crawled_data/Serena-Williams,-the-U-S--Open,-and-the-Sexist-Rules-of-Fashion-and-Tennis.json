{"title": "Serena Williams, the U.S. Open, and the Sexist Rules of Fashion and Tennis", "content": "Before the explosive women\u2019s singles final of the U.S. Open, which saw Serena Williams pitted against an umpire she described as sexist as well as the winner Naomi Osaka, tennis was already in an uproar.\nThe previous brouhaha, of course, was a recent tempest in a tennis racket over the catsuit Serena Williams wore to the French Open, which apparently didn\u2019t sufficiently \u201crespect the game\u201d for Bernard Giudicelli, the president of the French Tennis Federation. \nCue a social media spike of outrage and eloquence over the \u201cpolicing of women\u2019s bodies,\u201d as Billie Jean King tweeted.\nThe situation was expertly deflected by Ms. Williams herself, who knows a thing or two about spin. But I can\u2019t help but wonder if we are all missing the forest for the tree. Because pondering the catsuit hoo-ha has raised another, broader question.\nWhy, in 2018, when performance garments are practically a science unto themselves, sneakers a designer staple and gender-fluid clothes a reality, are female tennis players still going through the motions of wearing a little flap of fabric around the hips in order to suggest a dress?\nIt\u2019s the clothing equivalent of a vestigial tail.\nJust consider the Nike looks on Simona Halep (who lost in the first round) and on the returning champion Sloane Stephens. Both \u201cdresses\u201d had draped skirts slit to the waist, which played peekaboo with the patterned compression shorts underneath. When the women are in motion, as they most often are on the court, the slit has the effect of turning the \u201cdress\u201d into something that most resembles what the outside world might call a peplum top. Or a long shirt.\n\u201cWe had fun with the skirt,\u201d Abby Swancutt, the design director of Nike Court, explained in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s designed to open up at the left hip to give athletes maximum range of motion, and this silhouette also highlights the beautiful pleating construction of the skirt, and shows off the tie-dyed ball short. A slightly shorter length really helps for maximum range of motion.\u201d\nYet, at this point, \u201cslightly shorter\u201d has become so abbreviated that the resulting garments would never qualify as dresses to anyone in the outside world. And it\u2019s not just Nike, but also Adidas\u2019s color-blocked Stella McCartney styles and Fila\u2019s star-spangled heritage looks, to name a few other U.S. Open fashion debuts. They barely even qualify as tunics.\nThere are exceptions, of course. Ms. Williams\u2019s Virgil Abloh for Nike asymmetric tulle tutu, which looks like the sort of thing a \u201cSwan Lake\u201d cygnet might wear if she suddenly developed a yen for breathable fabrics, and Maria Sharapova\u2019s LBD with strategic back cutouts, were cut into recognizable cocktail silhouettes.\nBut the general effect is of a notional dress. Which is to say, a garment that once had a purpose \u2014 cloaking the female athlete in the socially acceptable markings of her gender so her power was somehow less threatening \u2014 but serves it no longer.\nThis is only underscored by the Adidas satin shorts and tank worn by Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza at the Open. The shorts, which have a bit of a flip at the side, don\u2019t look that different from the skirts-over-shorts worn by her fellow competitors. So why bother with the extra fabric in the first place? It can\u2019t enhance performance.\nAfter all, female players don\u2019t have to wear dresses or skirts. There is nothing in the Grand Slam rule book that forbids simply wearing, say, shorts. It requires only \u201cclean and customarily acceptable tennis attire,\u201d as \u201cdetermined by each respective Grand Slam Tournament.\u201d Which is the hitch. What is customarily acceptable tennis attire? \nDepends on the viewer, presumably. As the Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart once said of pornography, \u201cI know it when I see it.\u201d\nAt least it seems that shorts increasingly qualify. Maria Sharapova wore a white shorts tuxedo look at Wimbledon in 2008. Victoria Azarenka has been a fan of shorts off and on since 2012. Demi Schuurs, a dominant Dutch doubles player, wears men\u2019s shorts. Ms. Williams herself wore a shorts unitard at the U.S. Open in 2002. \nMost women players practice in shorts. And they all wear them under their skirts and dresses when they compete, as opposed to the frilly underpants of yesteryear. \nThe dresses \u2014 or dress gestures \u2014 may be a nod to history, and to the women who came before and what they wore (long lawn skirts!). They may be, as Ms. Swancutt of Nike said, a symbol to the athlete of the difference between a Slam and a practice session, and thus a psychological tool. They may enhance the feeling of readiness by dint of style. \nBut they also seem like shadows of older stereotypes. And such goals can also be achieved by other decorative means and materials, as Nike itself has shown with Ms. Williams\u2019s catsuit, and as fashion has long known.\nIt\u2019s time we served those up.", "date": "Aug. 28, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/28/style/tennis-fashion-us-open-serena-williams.html", "tags": "tennis dresses open fashion sexist nike u.s. \u201d ms. serena women shorts williams rules"}
