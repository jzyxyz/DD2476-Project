{"title": "Rep- Steve King Goes Full White Nationalist In Interview With Austrian Site", "content": "Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) visited Austria in August and gave an extensive interview to a far-right publication there in which he spelled out, in clearer and more shocking terms than he ever has before, his white nationalist worldview. \nThe eight-term congressman, up for re-election next month, talked to Caroline Sommerfeld of the Austrian far-right propaganda site Unzensuriert (which means \u201cuncensored\u201d in English). Sommerfeld is a prominent intellectual in Europe\u2019s neo-fascist identitarian movement, which has deep connections to America\u2019s so-called alt-right.\nThe interview, published in September, came to HuffPost\u2019s attention this week. In his conversation with Sommerfeld, King discussed his belief in the superiority of European culture over others. He talked fearfully of falling fertility rates in the West and spoke at length about his belief that Europe and America are threatened by Muslim and Latino immigration. \n\u201cIf we don\u2019t defend Western civilization, then we will become subjugated by the people who are the enemies of faith, the enemies of justice,\u201d King said.\nThe interview is remarkable, capturing a sitting U.S. congressman completely fluent in modern white nationalist talking points just weeks before an election he is favored to win. \n\u201cThis interview reveals a whole new level of reality underneath this guy\u2019s politics,\u201d said Roger Griffin, an expert on fascism and modern history at Oxford Brookes University. \nKing never would have opened up that way with mainstream reporters, since they wouldn\u2019t understand what he was talking about, Griffin said. He added, \u201cBut with her, who is obviously steeped in this stuff, he just opens up because he knows he\u2019s going to be understood.\u201d\nThe congressman\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment.\u00a0The interview took place on Aug. 24 at the Vienna Marriott Hotel and was conducted in English, according to Unzensuriert.\nKing\u2019s conversation with Sommerfeld largely revolves around the paranoid idea of the Great Replacement \u2014 the belief that mass migration, particularly from Muslim-majority countries, is an extinction-level event for white European culture and identity. Or as he put it in the interview, a \u201cslow-motion cultural suicide.\u201d \n\u201cThe U.S. subtracts from its population a million of our babies in the form of abortion,\u201d King said. \u201cWe add to our population approximately 1.8 million of \u2018somebody else\u2019s babies\u2019 who are raised in another culture before they get to us.\u201d \nSommerfeld responded, \u201cThat\u2019s what we call the Great Replacement.\u201d \nNick Ryan, the director of communications at the British-based anti-racism advocacy group\u00a0Hope Not Hate, told HuffPost that \u201cterms such as \u2018Great Replacement\u2019 are the preserve of conspiracy theorists and extremists.\u201d \nIt\u2019s a phrase, he said, widely used by anti-Muslim European networks to refer to the supposed Islamification of Europe by migrants and refugees.\nThe idea of the Great Replacement is imagined most vividly in The\u00a0Camp of the Saints, a stunningly racist 1973 novel by Jean Raspail that \u201creframes everything as the fight to death between races,\u201d said C\u00e9cile Alduy, a professor of French at Stanford University and an expert on France\u2019s far right. It describes the takeover of Europe by waves of immigrants that \u201cwash ashore like the plague.\u201d \nIn the interview, King said that he read the book and that it was \u201ccompletely logical to me that this could come to pass.\u201d He went on to describe how he believes George Soros, the billionaire philanthropist and bogeyman of the far right, might be footing the bill for the Great Replacement. \nUnzensuriert is known in Austria for routinely publishing Islamophobic, anti-refugee articles and attacking the country\u2019s traditional media outlets. In recent months, it has translated more of its articles into English in an attempt to reach a larger audience. \u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cUnzensuriert is very much like a German-language version of Breitbart,\u201d said Ingrid Brodnig, the author of a book about online misinformation and an expert on the Austrian far right. She said many of Unzensuriert\u2019s stories are not factual. \u201cThey are opinion pieces which offer a far-right view on the world.\u201d\u00a0\nLast year Austria\u2019s intelligence services, in an internal report that was leaked to Austrian media, found that the site promoted anti-Semitism and extreme xenophobia. The site also spreads misinformation and conspiracies: Of the 10 best-performing Unzensuriert articles on Facebook, five contained false information or were wholly debunked, according to BuzzFeed Germany.\nThe site has close ties with the far-right Freedom Party, or FPO, and its former editor-in-chief is now the head of communications for the FPO-controlled Interior Ministry.\nKing celebrated President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration with FPO leaders in Washington.\nKing has long-standing connections to the far right in Europe and was the first elected U.S. official\u00a0to meet with France\u2019s National Front leader, Marine Le Pen. In the interview with Unzensuriert, he mentioned that he phoned Dutch anti-Islam politician Geert Wilders to offer support after Wilders was convicted of hate speech. King\u2019s affinity for the global far right extends to outright extremists \u2014 including retweeting British neo-Nazi Mark Collett and this week endorsing Canadian white nationalist Faith Goldy. \nJ.D. Scholten, King\u2019s Democratic opponent, told HuffPost that while King had time to talk to Unzensuriert during his visit to Austria, he skipped an editorial board interview with The Des Moines Register, Iowa\u2019s largest newspaper, before the election. \n\u201cIt\u2019s disrespectful to this district that he\u2019s spent more time (5 times in the last 6 years) in Austria on TAXPAYER DIME than he does in most counties in our district,\u201d Scholten wrote in an email.\u00a0\nKing, who represents one of the reddest districts in America, has beaten his Democratic opponents by more than 20 points in the past five elections. An Emerson College poll last month showed him leading Scholten by 10 percentage points.\nJosh Groeneveld contributed reporting from HuffPost Germany.\u00a0\nThis story has been amended to reflect that Unzensuriert previously misstated the date it said King\u2019s interview took place and corrected its statement.\u00a0", "date": "\n10/19/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/iowa-rep-steve-king-austria-white-nationalist_n_5bca4851e4b0a8f17eec6001", "tags": "goes site austria steve austrian full great white interview \u201d europe unzensuriert sommerfeld king rep- nationalist"}
