{"title": "'Game Of Thrones' Star Talks Revealing That Jon Snow Bombshell", "content": "Jon Snow finally knows something.\nIn the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d Season 8 premiere on Sunday, Samwell Tarly (John Bradley) finally revealed to Jon Snow (Kit Harington) the mother of all secrets: his parents are Lyanna Stark (Aisling Franciosi) and Rhaegar Targaryen (Wilf Scolding),\u00a0his name is Aegon Targaryen, and he is the rightful heir to the Iron Throne.\nThe King in the North is shook.\nWe knew it was coming. After years of theories (decades really), the show\u2019s sixth season confirmed fans\u2019 suspicions that R + L = J (that\u2019s fanspeak for Rhaegar + Lyanna = Jon) with a pivotal scene at the Tower of Joy. Of course, Rhaegar was known to have married Elia Martell, so technically Jon still could have been a bastard. But in Season 7, Gilly (Hannah Murray) discovers Rhaegar got an annulment, and it\u2019s later revealed that he and Lyanna were legally married. Jon Snow, aka Aegon Targaryen, is the legitimate heir to the throne.\u00a0\nSam and Bran, aka the Three-Eyed Raven, aka the Westerosi Google search, learned all of that information in some of the final moments of Season 7, so it was only a matter of time before Jon learned the truth.\u00a0\nFollowing the Season 7 finale, Bran himself (Isaac Hempstead Wright) got on the phone with HuffPost and said he hoped Sam would be the one to ultimately deliver the news to Jon.\n\u201cIt\u2019d be a bit of an underwhelming reunion for Jon to come back like, \u2018Bran, how are you?\u2019 [And Bran goes], \u2018Great.\u00a0I know everything and you\u2019re the heir to the Iron Throne.\u2019 Probably don\u2019t want that kind of delivery,\u201d he said.\nOn Sunday, Hempstead Wright got his wish.\nToward the end of the episode, Bran prompts Sam to tell Jon the truth of his parentage, basically saying, \u201cThe fans have waited long enough! Just do it!\u201d\nSam finds Jon in the Winterfell crypts and, after an awkward reunion \u2014 he\u2019s obviously been avoiding Jon the whole time he\u2019s been at Winterfell to keep from telling him the news \u2014 he drops the truth bomb, saying Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) shouldn\u2019t be the queen. Jon\u2019s really Aegon Targaryen, Sixth of His Name, the whole shebang:\nThere\u2019s a lot going on in this moment. Sam has also just learned from Dany that she incinerated his brother and father when they did not bend the knee, so the idea of serving under the Mother of Dragons doesn\u2019t sit too well with him. He tells Jon as much, saying he should be the king and asking him if he would have also burned the Tarlys.\nJon says he\u2019s executed men before, but the implication is, no, he wouldn\u2019t have had a dragon fry Sam\u2019s family to a crisp. Understandably.\nTalking to HuffPost about the moment, Sam actor John Bradley, said:\n\u201cIt\u2019s never going to be easy telling somebody what Sam\u2019s got to tell Jon, but I think that as far as Jon\u2019s concerned, if he had to hear that, he\u2019d want to hear it from Sam. I think he knows that Sam\u2019s the one who does love him and he has his best interest at heart. ...\u00a0He wouldn\u2019t be telling Jon for any kind of agenda or to kind of start trouble. He\u2019d be telling him because he feels that he needs to know. I think if Jon was to hear it from anybody, he\u2019d rather hear it from a source he trusts and loves.\u201d\nDuring the scene, Jon protests that Ned Stark (Sean Bean) wouldn\u2019t have kept that truth from him. (Sure, maybe he wouldn\u2019t have if he had made it out of King\u2019s Landing.)\nBut in the end, and with surprisingly little evidence from Sam \u2014 no worries, Sam, we all know you\u2019re right \u2014 Jon seems to accept his parentage, reaching his final form:\u00a0an R + L = J stan.\nBradley added, \u201cI think [fans] will take away from that moment a real sense of the right thing\u2019s been done by the right person.\u201d\nComposer Ramin Djawadi\u2019s score puts the punctuation on the moment, making it the standout scene of the Season 8 premiere.\nThe implications here are game-changing. Like Sam says, Jon is the true heir to the throne. The weight of that statement hits him hard. Well, it\u2019s that, or the fact that he just found out he\u2019s been hooking up with his aunt.\nThat\u2019s not a cute look.\nOf course, \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d has already had Jaime (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) and Cersei\u2019s (Lena Headey) \u201ctwincest\u201d relationship going on for years, and the Targaryens have a history of marrying each other. Dany\u2019s parents, for instance, were brother and sister, and if not for Khal Drogo (Jason Momoa) she would have likely ended up with her brother Viserys (Harry Lloyd).\u00a0\nGeorge R.R. Martin, author of the \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire\u201d novels on which the HBO series is based, said as much in the first book:\u00a0\u201cShe had always assumed that she would wed Viserys when she came of age.\u201d\n\u00a0(Guess she\u2019ll have to settle for her nephew. Tough break, bruh.)\nAll that being said, still \u2026 gross.\nSo what now? Will Jon tell Dany immediately? Will he still \u201ckeep his queen warm\u201d? Could he suddenly realize that earlier he was riding Rhaegal, a dragon named after his daddy? Whatever happens, rest assured: Jon Snow knows something. Actually, forget that, now he knows way too much.", "date": "\n04/14/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/game-of-thrones-season-8-jon-snow-targaryen_n_5caf34dbe4b0308735d5c032", "tags": "revealing targaryen sam season bombshell \u201d jon knows snow thrones bran star talks"}
