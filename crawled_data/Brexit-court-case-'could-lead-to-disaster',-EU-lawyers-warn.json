The UK government was worried that anything said about Brexit by European judges could be used as ammunition in the battle to bring down Theresa May's deal. \nThe EU fretted about Article 50 being re-written in a way that meant a country could announce it was leaving then change its mind again and again, creating a state of permanent anxiety. Or worse, using it as a tactic to secure a better deal at the EU's expense. \nThe campaigners who brought the case were just glad that the concept of Brexit being reversed had a very public airing so close to the vote on the deal by MPs. \nHubert Legal, the chief lawyer for the European Council, argued that allowing unilateral withdrawal could therefore lead to \"disaster\", of which \"the main victim could be the European project altogether\".\nThis was echoed by lawyers for the European Commission, who said states could act in an \"abusive\" manner by stopping and restarting the countdown clock, creating \"endless uncertainty\" - which the two-year time limit built into Article 50 was designed to guard against.\nA four-hour hearing on Tuesday morning saw the full court of 27 judges consider the arguments in the case. \nThe court has said it will aim to decide \"quickly\" on the case, but has not yet set a date for doing so.\nThe case is being considered against the backdrop of Prime Minister Theresa May fighting to sell her draft Brexit deal to MPs, ahead of a vote in the Commons in December.\nThe UK will leave the EU on 29 March under the terms of \"Article 50\", a two-year notification of withdrawal which MPs triggered in March last year.\nThe case has been brought by a cross-party group of Scottish politicians including Green MSPs Andy Wightman and Ross Greer, MEP Alyn Smith and MP Joanna Cherry of the SNP, and Labour MEPs David Martin and Catherine Stihler. \nThey say it could give MPs an extra option when considering whether to approve the draft deal or not, because it could keep alive the prospect of calling off Brexit\nMr Wightman said the question was \"vital\", saying that \"the chaos around Brexit shows no sign of being resolved\" and that the UK parliament \"must be fully informed of all of its options\".\nAidan O'Neill QC, who is representing the Scottish politicians, told the court that European lawyers were inviting the judges to act \"unconstitutionally and in contravention of the rule of law by reinterpreting the treaties\".\nHe said: \"It cannot be in the interest of the union as a whole to force a member state to leave the union against the wishes of the people. \n\"The union's wider interest lies with member states remaining in the EU when their peoples wish to do so.\"\nThe UK government has opposed the case being heard from the outset, but failed to prevent it going before judges in Luxembourg after a series of appeals.\nThe UK government's position is that the court has \"long refused for very good reasons\" to answer hypothetical questions which could interfere with domestic politics. They argue that because \"the UK does not intend to revoke its notification\", the question of whether it can do so unilaterally is a hypothetical one.\nMs Cherry raised the case and the issue of revoking Article 50 with Mrs May in the Commons on Monday, prompting the prime minister to say that \"it is not going to happen because it is not government policy\".\nAdvocate General Lord Keen, who is representing the UK government, argued in court that the case was being used as \"ammunition\" by opponents of Brexit, and said the judges should find it inadmissable.", "date": "27 November 2018", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-46345287", "tags": "brexit european uk eu court disaster warn lead lawyers judges could case deal"}
