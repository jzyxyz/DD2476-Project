{"title": "Trump Signs New Trade Deal With Canada and Mexico After Bitter Negotiations", "content": "BUENOS AIRES \u2014 President Trump and his Mexican and Canadian counterparts sought to put the acrimony of the past two years behind them on Friday as they signed a new trade agreement governing hundreds of billions of dollars in commerce that underpins their mutually dependent economies.\nMeeting for the first time since the revised North American Free Trade Agreement was sealed, Mr. Trump, President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada hailed the results as a boon for workers, businesses and the environment, even as they alluded to the harsh talks that had preceded this day.\nBut Mr. Trump faces a daunting challenge at home, where Congress must approve the deal before it can take effect.\nThe complicated politics of trade would have made the task formidable enough even before the midterm elections, but it will grow only more so once Democrats assume control of the House in January.\nIn signing the agreement on Friday, Mr. Trump sought to ratchet up the pressure on President Xi Jinping of China, with whom he will meet on Saturday amid an escalating trade war.\nMr. Trump has already imposed tariffs of 10 percent on many Chinese goods and has threatened to raise them to 25 percent. He signaled as late as Friday that he may reach an understanding with Mr. Xi during a dinner to forestall such a move.\nThe agreement with Canada and Mexico is a signature achievement for Mr. Trump, who has long derided nearly every major trade deal that the United States has entered.\nSome pro-trade lawmakers complain that the revised agreement puts too many limits on the free flow of goods and services across borders, while trade skeptics maintain that it does not do enough to safeguard American jobs, encourage higher wages and protect the environment.\nSubmission to Congress will open a frenzy of fresh negotiations over legislation to enact the agreement, potentially unraveling the careful balance achieved with Mexico and Canada.\nNegotiators reached a last-minute deal in September after months of rancorous talks that raised doubts about whether any accord was possible. Mr. Trump repeatedly assailed his counterparts and threatened to scrap Nafta altogether.\nThe appearance of the three leaders side by side in Buenos Aires to attend an economic summit meeting of the Group of 20, or G-20, was meant to paper over the bitterness, but the hard feelings were still evident.\n\u201cWe worked hard on this agreement,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s been long and hard. We\u2019ve taken a lot of barbs and a little abuse, and we got there. It\u2019s great for all of our countries.\u201d\nMr. Trump did not say that he was the one who had dished out most of the barbs and much of the abuse, but he insisted that he had come out of the process with a stronger relationship with the two leaders.\nHe said that Mr. Trudeau, whom he once assailed as \u201cvery dishonest and weak,\u201d had become \u201ca great friend,\u201d despite it all.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a battle,\u201d he added, \u201cand battles sometimes make great friendships.\u201d\nStoic and unmoved, Mr. Trudeau did not respond directly but seemed to refer implicitly to speculation that he might not attend the ceremony and send a lower-level official to sign in his place.\nHis schedule for Buenos Aires did not initially list the ceremony. He opted to attend anyway, saying the deal \u201cmaintains stability for Canada\u2019s entire economy\u201d and removes the dangers associated with a threatened United States withdrawal.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here today,\u201d he said. \u201cThe new agreement lifts the risk of serious economic uncertainty that lingers throughout a trade renegotiation process.\u201d\nMr. Trudeau pointedly referred to the accord as the \u201cnew North American Free Trade Agreement\u201d and described it as \u201cmodernizing Nafta,\u201d despite Mr. Trump\u2019s effort to rebrand it as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.\nThe Canadian leader also used the occasion to press Mr. Trump on steel and aluminum tariffs, which remain unresolved.\n\u201cMake no mistake, we will stand up for our workers and fight for their families and their communities,\u201d Mr. Trudeau said. \u201cAnd Donald, it\u2019s all the more reason why we need to keep working to remove the tariffs on steel and aluminum between our two countries.\u201d\nThe signing came shortly after a separate ceremony, hosted by Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, presenting Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, with Mexico\u2019s highest award for foreigners in honor of his role in negotiating the trade agreement.\nThe announcement this week that the award would go to Mr. Kushner drew waves of criticism, given the insulting language Mr. Trump has used about Mexicans, including his description during the presidential campaign of illegal immigrants from Mexico as rapists.\nIn accepting the Order of the Aztec Eagle from Mexico, Mr. Kushner insisted that the president\u2019s harsh language did not reflect the trust that has developed between the leaders of the two countries.\n\u201cThrough your direction and leadership we were able to accomplish a lot of great things,\u201d Mr. Kushner told Mr. Trump at the ceremony. \u201cWhile there has been a lot of tough talk, I have seen the genuine respect and care that President Trump has for Mexico and the Mexican people, and I do believe we have been able to put that in the right light.\u201d\nWhile analysts said the new trade agreement was not as much of a transformation as Mr. Trump has suggested, it does rewrite the rules for an extraordinary amount of commerce between the three nations.\nThe United States did $581.6 billion in business with Canada last year, and $557.6 billion with Mexico, making them the nation\u2019s second- and third-largest trading partners.\nUnder the agreement, American dairy farmers would be allowed greater access to Canada\u2019s market to sell their cheese, milk and other products. A higher percentage of cars would have to be manufactured in North America and factories must pay their workers an average of $16 an hour or more to be exempted from tariffs.\nThe deal also updates provisions on the digital economy, agriculture and labor unions, but it preserves an international dispute mechanism that Mr. Trump had sought to eliminate.\nWhether Mr. Trump can reach across the aisle to sell it to Congress remains an open question. In nearly two years in office, he has made little effort to forge bipartisan consensus in Congress, as Republicans controlled both chambers.\nBut trade muddies the usual partisan lines, with free traders and skeptics of globalization in both parties, and the dynamics were further complicated by the announcement this week by General Motors that it will eliminate 14,000 jobs and idle five plants in the United States and Canada.\nMr. Trump played down the challenge on Friday, expressing confidence that he would easily win approval by Congress.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been so well reviewed, I don\u2019t expect to have very much of a problem,\u201d he said.\nBusiness groups and some Republicans praised the agreement and called for expeditious endorsement by lawmakers. \u201cI believe it will create more jobs and expand economic opportunities for American workers, farmers and manufacturers by leveling the playing field on trade,\u201d said Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio.\nBut Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic minority leader and a longtime critic of Nafta, said on Friday that the new agreement could not be \u201csimply a rebranding of the same old policies that hurt our economy and workers for years\u201d if it is to pass Congress.\n\u201cIt must prove to be a net benefit to middle-class families and working people in our country and must have strong labor and environmental protections, which in the present deal are too weak,\u201d he said.\nA dozen Republican senators sent Mr. Trump a letter last week urging him to submit the agreement for approval in the lame-duck session of the departing Congress before Democrats assume control of the House in January.\nSenator Patrick J. Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania who signed the letter, said the deal still needed to be improved even now, despite what he considered the improvements to the trade structure between the three nations.\n\u201cUnfortunately, the benefits of these enhancements are more than offset by the trade-limiting provisions,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cHowever, I would be willing to vote for the agreement if the president takes steps to strengthen it in the coming weeks through pro-trade modifications in the implementing legislation.\u201d", "date": "Nov. 30, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/30/world/americas/trump-trudeau-canada-mexico.html", "tags": "agreement \u201c signs bitter trump mexico trade new canada congress deal negotiations"}
