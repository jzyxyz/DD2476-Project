{"title": "'Game Of Thrones' Won't Stop Hinting At That Dark Daenerys Theory", "content": "Warning: Spoilers below!\nYou mad after that episode of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d? Because Dany (Emilia Clarke) is, and it seems like she\u2019s just getting started.\nWasn\u2019t this supposed to be a victory lap?\nIn Episode 3, \u201cThe Long Night,\u201d Arya (Maisie Williams) shattered the Night King (Vladim\u00edr Furd\u00edk) \u2014 the embodiment of death \u2014 into a million ice cubes with one thrust of a Valyrian steel dagger \u2015 thus supposedly ending the threat of the army of the dead.\nBut apparently, death doesn\u2019t have anything on Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey).\nWhereas the Night King clearly hadn\u2019t been watching game film (Arya\u2019s been practicing that dagger switch for a while, dude), Cersei did her prep work. In Episode 4, she dealt the dragon queen two shocking losses:\u00a0Missandei (Nathalie Emmanuel) and her baby boy Rhaegal.\u00a0\nMissandei of Naath has been on the show since Season 3, becoming one of Dany\u2019s closest friends and most trusted advisers after the Mother of Dragons acquired the Unsullied army. Sadly, now her watch has ended.\nAs much as we loved Missandei, she was probably on borrowed time already, planning a beach getaway with Grey Worm (Jacob Anderson) before the battle with the dead even began.\nIn Sunday\u2019s episode, after being captured by Cersei\u2019s forces, Missandei is beheaded by the Mountain (Haf\u00fe\u00f3r Bj\u00f6rnsson) in front of Dany and what\u2019s left of her army. Her last word was \u201cDracarys,\u201d basically imploring Dany to burn the eff out of Cersei.\nGrey Worm is, understandably, heartbroken.\u00a0\nAnd in addition to that loss \u2015 among ongoing struggles with Jon Snow (Kit Harington) and Sansa (Sophie Turner) \u2015 the Mother of Dragons lost another one of her kiddos.\u00a0Rhaegal is taken down by Euron (Pilou Asb\u00e6k) and his fleet in a surprise attack when Dany and her team are heading south.\u00a0\nWith that, it looks like a well-worn \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d theory may finally be coming true: It\u2019s time for the Mad Queen to \u201cburn them all.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d is a cyclical show, as all the constant callbacks of Season 8 prove over and over again, and the idea that Dany becomes the villain, aka the Mad Queen \u2014 much like her father, Aerys Targaryen II, the Mad King \u2014 has been alive within the fan base for years.\nWe asked her friend zone ambassador, Jorah Mormont (Iain Glen), about the idea in 2017 \u2014and at the time, he was doubtful, telling us, \u201cMy belief in her is such that I can\u2019t see her going that way myself, so I think that\u2019s highly unlikely. It becomes academic whether I would stand by her or not because I don\u2019t believe that would happen.\u201d\nBut times have changed.\u00a0\nWe\u2019ll see what happens in Episode 5 next week, but it\u2019s safe to say Dany\u2019s new House words are, \u201cWe don\u2019t need no water, let that Mother of Dragons burn.\u201d", "date": "\n05/06/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/game-of-thrones-season-8-daenerys-theory_n_5ccde395e4b0e4d7573372f8", "tags": "dark mad cersei game wo episode \u201d theory stop missandei thrones hinting dany daenerys \u2014"}
