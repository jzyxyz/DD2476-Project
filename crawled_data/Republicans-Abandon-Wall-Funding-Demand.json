{"title": "Republicans Abandon Wall Funding Demand", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2015 Republicans, facing the refusal of Democrats to fund President Donald Trump\u2019s border wall in an upcoming spending bill, seem to have abandoned their wall construction demands as lawmakers work to avert a government shutdown.\n\u201cNo wall money in latest offer\u201d from Republicans, a congressional aide confirmed.\nAlthough Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) declined to detail the talks, he and other members of the Democratic leadership team seemed convinced wall funding was now off the table. With that issue settled, Democrats suggested they were making real progress toward passing an omnibus spending bill by Friday, when government funding runs out.\n\u201cThe president\u2019s 11th-hour demand [for wall money] threatened to upend the progress. We\u2019re pleased he\u2019s backing off,\u201d Schumer said.\nSchumer added that there remain a number of outstanding issue. \u201cFirst and foremost, Democrats remain committed to making sure there are no poison-pill riders in this agreement,\u201d Schumer said, referring to amendments that are intended to be politically divisive.\n\u201cThe fact that the wall is now off the table, Americans should breathe a huge sigh of relief,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cThe negotiations can resume and move forward.\u201d\nTrump and other administration officials had previously indicated they would demand wall funding in the omnibus spending bill, with Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney raising the possibility that Republicans would offer dollar-for-dollar funding between a wall and Obamacare subsidies for low-income people. \nBut Democrats have been resolute that they won\u2019t accept money for a physical border wall in any spending bill. That leaves Republicans with an obvious choice: Either abandon their demand for wall funding, or insist on the money, try to make Democrats cave, and risk a potential government shutdown.\nWith Republicans in control of the House, the Senate, and the White House, Democrats were willing to bet that voters would blame the GOP for a shutdown \u2015 and that a lapse in government funding would show that Trump and congressional Republicans can\u2019t govern. In short, Republicans had hardly any leverage, and Democrats knew it.\nRepublicans don\u2019t have the votes to pass an omnibus bill on their own. They need at least eight Democrats in the Senate to get 60 votes, and potentially many more Democrats in the House. Democrats, lacking the votes to pass a bill themselves, have taken a hard line on the spending bill, denying Trump and Republicans a number of policy priorities, including defunding Planned Parenthood, restricting money for immigration \u201csanctuary cities,\u201d and blowing up the subsidy program for the Affordable Care Act.\nWithout those GOP wins, more and more Republicans have appeared apt to vote against the legislation, tilting further momentum toward Democrats. That has put Democrats in a position to fund their own priorities, like the Obamacare subsidies, and simultaneously troll Trump.\n\u201cPresident Trump laid out his demands for this spending bill, and thankfully, Democrats and many Republicans in Congress have so far stood together to say \u2018absolutely not.\u2019\u201d Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) said Tuesday.\nMurray continued that Trump had dropped all demands to defund Planned Parenthood, and hasn\u2019t said \u201ca word about the $18 billion in extreme [domestic spending] cuts that his fellow Republicans have simply ignored.\u201d\n\u201cAllow Democrats and Republicans to work together,\u201d Murray added, \u201cand don\u2019t shut down the government to try to distract people from your failed 100 days in office.\u201d\nThere are still a number of issues for Democrats and Republicans to work out before they can reach a deal. Lawmakers have yet to settle on miners\u2019 health provisions, Puerto Rico funding, or how much money the spending bill will deliver for Obamacare subsidies. Those unresolved issues could lead Republicans and Democrats toward another short-term funding bill for, say, a week or so.\nBut either way, it\u2019s clear that Trump\u2019s most significant demand, perhaps his signature campaign promise \u2015 the construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border \u2015 isn\u2019t going to happen soon.\nThat hasn\u2019t exactly deterred Trump or his administration. Department of Homeland Security spokesman David Lapan said recently that DHS could \u201creprogram\u201d existing funding to cover the cost of wall \u201cprototypes.\u201d\n\u201cNone of this is going to happen in one fiscal year,\u201d Lapan said.\nApparently not.\nElise Foley contributed reporting.", "date": "\n04/25/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/republicans-wall-funding_n_58ffb2a0e4b091e8c711147c", "tags": "funding wall democrats \u201d demand bill republicans abandon spending"}
