{"title": "Trump On Notre Dame Fire- 'Perhaps Flying Water Tankers Could Be Used To Put It Out'", "content": "President Donald Trump commented on the raging fire at the iconic Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris on Monday by suggesting first responders use \u201cflying water tankers\u201d to extinguish it.\n\u201cSo horrible to watch the massive fire at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris,\u201d the president tweeted shortly after news broke of the blaze. \u201cPerhaps flying water tankers could be used to put it out. Must act quickly!\u201d\nThe White House did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for additional comment about Trump\u2019s suggestion.\nFrance\u2019s civil security agency tweeted Monday evening that dropping water from a helicopter or airplane could lead to the collapse of the entire cathedral and cause collateral damage to surrounding buildings.\u00a0\nOfficials say the blaze broke out at the historic cathedral around 6:50 p.m. local time. Video of the fire showed the structure nearly totally engulfed in flames and smoke.\nThe fire, which appeared to be in the cathedral\u2019s attic, is \u201cpotentially linked\u201d to ongoing renovations, firefighters told Agence France-Presse.\nAfter his water-tanker tweet, Trump again addressed the Notre Dame blaze ahead of a roundtable discussion he was leading in Minnesota on economic issues, calling it \u201ca terrible, terrible fire.\u201d\n\u201cThe fire that they\u2019re having at the Notre Dame Cathedral is something like few people have witnessed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was burning at a level that you rarely see a fire burn.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the great treasures of the world,\u201d he said of the cathedral. \u201cIt might be greater than almost any museum in the world and it\u2019s burning very badly. Looks like its burning to the ground. ... I\u2019ve been there and I\u2019ve seen it ... There\u2019s no cathedral in the world like it.\u201d\nFirst lady Melania Trump tweeted that her \u201cheart breaks for the people of Paris.\u201d\n\u201cPraying for everyone\u2019s safety,\u201d she wrote.\nTrump\u2019s tweet about the Notre Dame fire was his second piece of unsolicited advice related to aviation on Monday. Earlier, he tweeted that Boeing should \u201cFIX the Boeing 737 MAX,\u201d the type of aircraft flown in the recent Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air crashes in which hundreds of people died.\n\u201cREBRAND the plane with a new name. No product has suffered like this one. But again, what the hell do I know?\u201d wrote the president, who walked away from his own failed airline, known as the Trump Shuttle, in 1992.\nThis story has been updated with comments from French officials.", "date": "\n04/15/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-notre-dame-fire_n_5cb4c426e4b082aab08a079e", "tags": "put tweeted fire used notre flying \u201d trump water cathedral could dame fire- like tankers"}
