{"title": "The Pen Proves Mighty for an Unlikely Trump Correspondent", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 It has become a favorite parlor trick of President Trump\u2019s, and on Wednesday, he was at it again, brandishing his latest letter from the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un.\n\u201cThose few people that I\u2019ve shown this letter to,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters during a cabinet meeting, his voice trailing off as he waved three typewritten sheets in front of the cameras. \u201cThey\u2019ve never written letters like that. This is a great letter. We\u2019ve made a lot of progress with North Korea and Kim Jong-un.\u201d\nIf history is any guide, he will end up showing Mr. Kim\u2019s letter to more than a few people. Mr. Trump delights in sharing with visitors the correspondence he has received from North Korea\u2019s leader since they began writing to each other last year.\nTypically, according to people who have witnessed such displays, Mr. Trump calls to an assistant sitting just outside the Oval Office to bring him \u201cthe letters,\u201d which he then fans out across the Resolute Desk so the people facing him can get a glimpse. They are translated into English and filled with flowery references to Mr. Trump as \u201cYour Excellency.\u201d\nTheirs is not the first improbable pen-pal relationship \u2014 Catherine the Great famously corresponded with Voltaire. Nor is it the most passionate \u2014 the writers Henry Miller and Anais Nin come to mind. But few pen-pal relationships have ever been so proudly celebrated, at least by one of the pals.\n\u201cHe wrote me beautiful letters,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a rally in September. \u201cAnd they\u2019re great letters. We fell in love.\u201d\nThe White House has yet to release any of Mr. Kim\u2019s missives to Mr. Trump, though the president did post on Twitter a brief letter he received from Mr. Kim in July. Mr. Trump has said he would like to make more of Mr. Kim\u2019s letters public but that the North Korean leader asked him to keep them private. In the meantime, the president plays peekaboo with inquiring reporters.\n\u201cOh, would you like to see what was in that letter. Wouldn\u2019t you like it?\u201d Mr. Trump joked last June when they pleaded for details of one letter. \u201cHow much? How much?\u201d\n\u201cIt was a very interesting letter,\u201d he continued, \u201cand at some point, it may be appropriate \u2014 I may be able to give it you.\u201d\nMr. Trump has a long history of showing off to visitors. His 26th-floor office at Trump Tower has a windowsill crammed with mementos, including a championship belt sent to him by the boxer Mike Tyson; a football helmet from Tom Brady, the New England Patriots quarterback whom the president once said he hoped would be his son-in-law; and a basketball shoe signed by Shaquille O\u2019Neal, the N.B.A. star.\n\u201cThis is some serious foot,\u201d he told a Wall Street Journal reporter, gesturing at the shoe, during the 2016 presidential campaign.\nWhat makes Mr. Kim\u2019s letters different, analysts said, is that they are key to a highly sensitive diplomatic negotiation over North Korea\u2019s nuclear arsenal. The North Korean leader, they said, has set out methodically to cultivate Mr. Trump \u2014 building a rapport with him, even to the exclusion of other senior American officials, like Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is overseeing the negotiations.\nSome analysts said they believed that South Korea\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in, had counseled Mr. Kim on the wording in the letters, calculating that the president would respond to flattery and a solicitous tone.\nIf so, it has worked: Mr. Trump has been unstinting in his praise of Mr. Kim, even as the nuclear negotiations have bogged down, sometimes rancorously. In one letter, said a person who saw it, Mr. Kim complained that he did not want to deal with Mr. Pompeo \u2014 only with Mr. Trump.\n\u201cWe really have established a very good relationship,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Wednesday, noting that he and Mr. Kim would meet for a second time. If he had not been elected, Mr. Trump added, the United States and North Korea would be involved in a \u201cnice, big, fat war.\u201d\n\u201cFrom a negotiation standpoint, what Trump thinks is happening is that he has the trust of Kim Jong-un,\u201d said Joseph Y. Yun, a former State Department official who has negotiated with North Korea.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve bonded, and what that means is that there\u2019s not going to be any hostility between them,\u201d Mr. Yun said. \u201cWhether Pompeo makes progress or not doesn\u2019t really matter because everyone has pulled back from the brink. There is no degree of urgency on the part of Trump.\u201d\nMr. Trump is not the first president to try to turn a hardened foe into a pen pal. His predecessor, Barack Obama, sent two letters to Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in 2009 to try to restart negotiations over its nuclear program. The ayatollah sent a multipage response to Mr. Obama\u2019s first letter and never replied to the second.\nThose letters, however, have never been released; the White House refused even to confirm their existence.\nMr. Trump has been considerably less discreet. In June, he posed, smiling, with Kim Yong-chol, an emissary from the North Korean leader, who had hand-delivered a letter from Mr. Kim in a curiously oversize envelope. After teasing reporters about its \u201cinteresting\u201d contents, he abruptly reversed course, when asked whether he had replied.\n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. I haven\u2019t seen the letter yet,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI purposely didn\u2019t open the letter. I haven\u2019t opened it.\u201d", "date": "Jan. 2, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/us/politics/trump-kim-jong-un-letters.html", "tags": "letter pen letters proves unlikely trump \u201d mighty correspondent kim north"}
