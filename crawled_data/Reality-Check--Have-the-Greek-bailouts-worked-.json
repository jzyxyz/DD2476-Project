{"title": "Reality Check: Have the Greek bailouts worked?", "content": "As eurozone finance ministers meet in Brussels for crucial talks on Greece, Reality Check looks at whether the bailouts the country has received have secured Greece's economic survival or just created unsustainable debt.\nNeither Greece nor its creditors would say they are happy with how it has worked out. \nIn 2010, when the Greek debt crisis started, Greece received \u20ac110bn (\u00a396bn) in bailout money.\nAnd in 2012, the country received a second bailout of \u20ac130bn.\nThese loans, from the eurozone and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), were deemed necessary to stop Greece going bankrupt.\nIn exchange, Greece was required to make deep public spending cuts, raise taxes and introduce fundamental changes to the public sector and labour legislation.\nIn August 2015, the eurozone countries agreed to give Greece a third bailout, of up to \u20ac86bn, on the condition of further changes. \nThe next tranche of that bailout, which Greece needs in order to honour repayments due in July, is being discussed at the eurozone finance ministers' meeting on Thursday. \nIn 2010, they managed to keep Greece in the euro and prevented the collapse of the common currency. \nSo, from the perspective of the eurozone as a whole, a chaotic \"Grexit\" did not happen.\nBut seven years on, and many more billions of euros later, was this price worth paying, both from the point of view of Greece's creditors and of the Greek people?\nIt is impossible to know what the situation would be like now had Greece not received the bailouts, but the consequences of receiving them have been painful.\nFor the Greek people, the bailouts and the austerity measures implemented with them have come at a huge cost. \nGreece's creditors, strongly influenced by Germany, demanded that Greece start spending less than it earned.\nIn 2016, for the first time, Greece achieved this. The surplus is small, at \u20ac1.3bn or 0.7% of GDP.\nBut this can hardly be seen as a success - the economy has shrunk and the overall debt pile is still going up, not down.\nWhat to do about the debt is the main stumbling block between Greece's creditors, the eurozone countries and the IMF. \nSome countries, including Germany and the Netherlands, do not want to release any more money unless the IMF agrees to be part of the third rescue programme for Greece.\nThey think that, without the IMF, the EU institutions would be too soft on Greece in their demands for changes.\nThe IMF has so far refused to get involved because it says Greece's debts are unsustainable and need restructuring. \nIt says that Greece cannot be expected to grow out of its debt problem, even with the full implementation of changes. \nThe talks on Thursday will determine whether Greece will be able to make the repayments due in July. \nBut the key question is whether the creditors can reach any agreement on restructuring Greek debt.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said he would \"lead the fight\" for debt relief because \"there's no chance of returning to a stable economy and society in the eurozone with the current level of debt\".\nGermany is much more reluctant to allow any debt relief, ahead of elections there in September.\nBailouts for Greece may have dropped from the headlines, but have they worked? Not yet.\nRead more from Reality Check\nFollow us on Twitter", "date": "15 June 2017", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-40288065", "tags": "debt imf bailouts creditors bailout greek received worked greece eurozone reality check"}
