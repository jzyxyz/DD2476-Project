{"title": "Sen- Blumenthal Says Donald Trump Jr- Should Be 'Locked Up' If He Defies Subpoena", "content": "Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) told reporters Thursday that Donald Trump Jr. should face jail time if he refuses to comply with a Senate subpoena concerning his contacts with Russia.\n\u201cIf he fails to answer, he ought to be put in jail,\u201d Blumenthal told reporters. \u201cIf he fails to comply with a lawful subpoena, he has no privilege. Prison is the only answer.\u201d\nNews that the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee has\u00a0subpoenaed Trump, the president\u2019s eldest son, broke Wednesday. The panel is seeking to question him about testimony he gave in 2017 to the Senate Judiciary Committee, of which Blumenthal is a member. Though Trump said at the time that he was only \u201cperipherally aware\u201d of plans to build a Trump Tower in Moscow, his father\u2019s former attorney Michael Cohen contradicted that claim when testifying in special council Robert Mueller\u2019s probe.\n\u201cI was in the room and my clear impression was that his answers were deliberately misleading and false,\u201d Blumenthal continued, referencing Trump\u2019s 2017 testimony. \u201cHe said he was only peripherally aware of the negotiations in Moscow for Trump Tower there when apparently he was briefed extensively.\u201d\nBlumenthal\u2019s comments come amid suspicion that the president\u2019s son will defy the subpoena. President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he was \u201cvery surprised\u201d by the request because he believed the Mueller report had \u201cexonerated\u201d his son and that he had given enough hours of testimony.\nWhen asked if his son would fight the Senate Intelligence Committee on this, Trump responded, \u201cWell, we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d\nThe Trump Tower Moscow deal, which Trump Sr. pursued throughout the 2016 campaign, remains controversial because the then-candidate repeatedly lied to the public about whether he had any business dealings with Russia.", "date": "\n05/09/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/richard-blumenthal-donald-trump-jr-subpoena_n_5cd49c85e4b0705e47d8fd0f", "tags": "testimony \u201c jr- son committee defies trump donald says senate sen- subpoena blumenthal"}
