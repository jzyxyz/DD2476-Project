{"title": "Senate Democrats Want To Stop Trump From Bringing Back Junk Health Insurance", "content": "Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) and 30 Democratic colleagues want to block a Trump administration regulation that could flood health insurance markets with junk coverage.\nThe effort seems unlikely to succeed. It requires passing a bill that would ultimately need support from both the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and President Donald Trump himself.\nBut Baldwin\u2019s gambit could force her GOP colleagues to declare publicly whether they support this latest effort to undermine the Affordable Care Act\u2019s insurance reforms \u2015 and to do so shortly the midterm elections, amid polling that shows voters care a lot about those reforms.\nThe impetus for all of this is a rule that the Trump administration had been promising since January and finalized in early August. The rule will make it easier for people to buy and then hold onto \u201cshort-term, limited-duration\u201d plans, which, as the name suggests, are supposed to serve as temporary stopgaps for people with brief lapses in coverage.\u00a0\nShort-term policies are exempt from the Affordable Care Act\u2019s rules, which means they don\u2019t have to include benefits like behavioral health, maternity care and prescription drugs that the 2010 health care law deemed essential.\u00a0\nInsurers also don\u2019t have to sell short-term policies to people who already have medical conditions. When beneficiaries file claims, insurers who sell these plans can scour medical records for evidence that the conditions were there all along.\nPrecisely because short-term plans don\u2019t end up paying out many big medical bills, they tend to be a lot cheaper than comprehensive policies. The Trump administration says that makes the plans a valuable alternative for\u00a0people who buy coverage on their own, don\u2019t get tax subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, also known as \u201cObamacare,\u201d and as a result, face high premiums. \nThose high premiums are likely the major reason that enrollment among these unsubsidized customers now seems to be falling, according to a recent analysis from the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.\nBut Baldwin, who has supported past initiatives to bolster the Affordable Care Act as well as proposals to replace private insurance with a single government program,\u00a0thinks short-term plans don\u2019t solve the problem and could make things worse. \nIn a Tuesday meeting with reporters, she\u00a0echoed a chorus of experts and state officials\u00a0\u2015 warning\u00a0that consumers might not understand the limits of what they are buying and that, as short-term plans lure people in good health, insurers will have to raise premiums for everybody else.\n\u201cIt is sabotage, in my mind,\u201d Baldwin said.\nBaldwin\u2019s bill to stop the regulation from taking effect falls under the Congressional Review Act, which means that it can get a floor vote with the support of just 30 senators \u2015 exactly the number of co-sponsors on the bill \u2015 and that it can pass with a simple majority.\nIf all 49 Democrats in the Senate support the bill, they would need just one or two Republicans to join them, depending on whether the seat of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who died Saturday, remains vacant.\nBaldwin said Tuesday that she had already approached two GOP senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, about supporting the resolution. Collins was one of three Republican senators who voted against the GOP\u2019s repeal bill in the summer of 2017, defeating it, and she has recently reiterated her support for the Affordable Care Act\u2019s protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\nCapito wavered on those repeal votes last year, ultimately supporting the final GOP bill, but Baldwin said she thought Capito might support this new resolution because mental health coverage, which short-term plans typically lack, is critical for treating the opioid addiction epidemic that has hit states like West Virginia hard.\nBaldwin said she hoped to continue reaching out to potential Republican supporters, including Alaska\u2019s Lisa Murkowski, who had joined Collins in voting no on Obamacare repeal. \nThe actual enthusiasm of those senators for Baldwin\u2019s measure remains to be seen. Republicans, on the whole, have been trying to avoid talking about health care this election season. When they can\u2019t avoid the subject, they have professed their own support for protections for pre-existing conditions, despite their record of supporting legislation that would undermine those protections.\nDemocrats can read the same polls as Republicans and, not surprisingly, they are raising the issue at every chance they get. That\u2019s especially true for senators, like Baldwin, who ar up for re-election in politically contested states that supported Trump in the 2016 presidential election.\nBut Baldwin also has a personal connection to the issue. She has frequently described having a childhood illness that left her with a pre-existing condition and uninsurable for many years. \u201cDespite my full recovery, which is irrelevant in actuary world, I was considered a child with a preexisting condition,\u201d Baldwin told\u00a0Vox this spring.\nAnd whether or not her bill can get past the Senate, let alone through the House and then win over the president, Baldwin said on Tuesday that it was important to put down a marker on behalf of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s consumer protections \u2015 and to remind voters that, without those protections in place, people could struggle to get insurance simply because they\u2019ve had medical problems, just as they did before the Affordable Care Act became law. \n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you the letters I used to get then,\u201d said Baldwin, who was a House member at the time. She went on to recount a story about a man who got cancer, only to discover that his insurance had limits on coverage. \nThe man and his wife took out loans and maxed out credit cards to pay for the chemotherapy, which was ultimately unsuccessful and left the wife ruined financially, Baldwin said.\n\u201cThey went bankrupt, they lost their house, they lost everything, and sadly,\u00a0in that case, the dad didn\u2019t survive,\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cHow many families should undergo things like that?\u201d", "date": "\n08/29/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/baldwin-trump-pre-existing-junk_n_5b85f8ade4b0cf7b0030086f", "tags": "support care bringing want \u201c democrats short-term baldwin back trump act senate stop affordable bill insurance junk health"}
