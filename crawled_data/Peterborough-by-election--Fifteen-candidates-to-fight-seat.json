{"title": "Peterborough by-election: Fifteen candidates to fight seat", "content": "Fifteen candidates for the Peterborough seat vacated by Fiona Onasanya have been confirmed.\nThe by-election on 6 June was triggered when Ms Onasanya was removed following a recall petition, after being jailed for lying about a speeding offence.\nShe won the seat for Labour in 2017, narrowly beating the Conservatives who had held it since 2005. \nBut UKIP and the Brexit Party will be hoping to capitalise on the city's 61% Leave vote in the 2016 EU referendum.\nDespite moves by pro-Remain parties to back a joint candidate, the Lib Dems, Greens and Renew have announced separate ones and Change UK - The Independent Group is not standing one at all.\nChange UK MP Gavin Shuker said the four parties had agreed to stand aside \"in favour of a genuinely independent, pro-People's Vote and pro-Remain candidate\" but blamed \"senior Labour figures\" for having \"made it clear that they would strenuously disrupt the campaign and obstruct an independent candidate\".\nBut Labour's Jonathan Reynolds said on BBC One's Question Time said Change UK's argument was \"strange\". \n\"Elections are contests between different candidates... so trying to somehow complain that political parties are going to fight against each other - that's exactly what elections are.\"\nA Lib Dem spokesman said the parties understood \"the need for a collective effort in securing a People's Vote and stopping Brexit\" but moves to back an independent candidate had not been successful.\nThe candidate they had planned to back, Femi Oluwole, told the BBC he had pulled out over concerns his candidacy would hand victory to the Brexit Party and ultimately harm the campaign for another referendum.\nThe confirmed candidates are:\nBrexit Party - Mike Greene\nChristian People's Alliance - Tom Rogers\nCommon Good: Remain in the EU - Dick Rodgers\nConservatives - Paul Bristow\nEnglish Democrats - Stephen Goldspink\nGreen Party - Joseph Wells\nIndependent - John Moore\nIndependent - Bobby Smith\nLabour - Lisa Forbes\nLiberal Democrats - Beki Sellick\nOfficial Monster Raving Loony Party - Alan \"Howling Laud\" Hope\nRenew - Peter Ward\nSDP Fighting for Brexit - Patrick O'Flynn\nUK European Union Party - Pierre Kirk\nUKIP - John Whitby", "date": "9 May 2019", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-48218957", "tags": "fifteen brexit uk independent candidates candidate parties peterborough party vote fight seat labour by-election"}
