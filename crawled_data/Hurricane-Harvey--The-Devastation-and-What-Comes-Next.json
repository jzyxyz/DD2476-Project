{"title": "Hurricane Harvey: The Devastation and What Comes Next", "content": "Overwhelmed by the news since Harvey made landfall? Here is an overview of coverage by The New York Times, which sent nearly two dozen journalists to Texas.\nWith rainfall topping 50 inches in some areas, Harvey devastated a swath of Texas stretching from the Houston area into Louisiana. \u201cOur whole city is underwater,\u201d Derrick Freeman, the mayor of Port Arthur, Tex., said on Wednesday. (Read an account from one of our reporters on his trip home to nearby Beaumont.)\nEven as the rain and wind moved on, the region continued to suffer consequences of the storm. Explosions rocked a chemical plant early Thursday, and many hazards lurk beneath the floodwaters that soaked the region. The storm has also forced Houston to grapple with the limits of its growth.\nHere are some of the most powerful photos of the devastation and a before-and-after look at the affected areas.\nIf you can do so safely, please share your own photos and videos here, or leave us a voice mail message. Listen to Thursday\u2019s episode of \u201cThe Daily\u201d to learn about how Houston was built to flood.\nAt least 39 people have died, including a Houston police officer, a family trapped in a van beneath surging floodwater, and a mother whose shivering 3-year-old was found clinging to her unresponsive body.\nSurvivors face hurdles of their own, with help likely to be slow in coming. Managing the shelters that are housing tens of thousands of them remains \u201cthe biggest battle that we have right now,\u201d Brock Long, the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said on Thursday. Rich and poor alike have had their homes and lives upended.\nThere were many positive stories, too. A huge volunteer effort operated with little official guidance. A businessman turned his mattress store into a safe haven. And the women and cat in a viral photo of a flooded nursing home are safe. The Houston Independent School District also said that all students will receive three free meals a day for the school year.\nHere\u2019s a look at how victims sought out help online.\nWhat set Harvey apart was its rain. Once it made landfall, the storm essentially stalled, turning roads into rivers. Scientists say it was fueled by a deadly combination of environmental factors.\nWhile it has been called a \u201c500-year flood,\u201d that term may be misleading: A similar storm may not be as far off as you might think.\nFor many people, the images of inundated streets and victims on rooftops evoked comparisons to Hurricane Katrina. In New Orleans, survivors of Katrina saw themselves in the scenes from Houston. And New Yorkers who survived Hurricane Sandy offered advice to the victims trying to piece their lives back together.\nThese maps track Harvey\u2019s path through Texas and Louisiana. And here\u2019s how experts prepared for the storm and worked to warn the public.\nMany organizations are helping victims on the ground. Here are a few of them; a fuller list can be found here. (For those who have been displaced, here\u2019s a guide to getting help.)\n\u2022 The Hurricane Harvey Relief Fund was established by Mayor Sylvester Turner of Houston and is administered by the Greater Houston Community Foundation.\n\u2022 The Houston Food Bank, the Galveston County Food Bank and the Food Bank of Corpus Christi are accepting online donations.\n\u2022 The Houston Humane Society and the San Antonio Humane Society are helping animals affected by the storm.\n\u2022 Save the Children is accepting donations.\nSome scams are circulating online. Here are a few things to watch out for.", "date": "Aug. 28, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/28/us/hurricane-harvey-texas.html", "tags": "next harvey victims texas \u2022 hurricane devastation new \u201d storm many comes houston"}
