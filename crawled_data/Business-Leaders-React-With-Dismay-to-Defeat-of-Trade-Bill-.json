{"title": "Business Leaders React With Dismay to Defeat of Trade Bill ", "content": "As big a setback as Friday\u2019s vote on Capitol Hill was for President Obama\u2019s efforts to advance his trade agenda, it was an even bigger rebuff for the leaders of American business.\nWhile there are deep divisions over trade policy among Democrats, and to some extent among Republicans as well, corporate America has been nearly unified in its support of a deal that would lower various barriers to trade and investment between the United States and 11 other Pacific Rim nations.\nThough many sought to put the best face on the vote, business groups and chief executives were quick to voice their displeasure with the House\u2019s rejection of aid to workers harmed by imports, which could doom prospects for eventual approval of a wider trade pact.\n\u201cThis is disappointing and discouraging,\u201d said Todd J. Teske, chief executive of Briggs & Stratton, a 107-year-old manufacturer based in Wauwatosa, Wis. \u201cWe do business around the world, and free and fair trade allows the U.S. and our company to be competitive globally.\u201d\nIn a classic strange-bedfellows-in-Washington moment, big-business lobbies swung into action Friday afternoon in a concerted effort to save a signature initiative of President Obama, a leader with whom they have rarely seen eye to eye.\n\u201cManufacturers will not back down in this fight for expanded trade, for the future of our industry and our country,\u201d the National Association of Manufacturers said in a statement.\nManufacturers have been among the most vocal supporters of what is formally known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or T.P.P., but officials from other sectors also made their frustration plain on Friday. David French, senior vice president for the National Retail Federation, called the vote \u201ca victory for those with a narrow agenda that puts petty politics ahead of people, while jeopardizing the futures of millions of men and women in America.\u201d\n\u201cIt is nothing short of astounding that in the 21st century anyone would think it is in our country\u2019s best interest to sit back and let foreign governments dictate our role in a global marketplace,\u201d he added.\nAfter the vote, many trade associations representing consumer electronics, semiconductor manufacturers and Silicon Valley firms, as well as individual companies like the computer chip maker Intel, issued statements cheering on the president and urging Congress to reconsider its opposition to the piece of the legislation dealing with assistance to workers.\nFriday\u2019s showdown on Capitol Hill makes the odds of a trade agreement before President Obama leaves the White House much longer, but some experts insist the fight is far from over.\n\u201cI\u2019m still hopeful,\u201d said Gary Hufbauer, a senior researcher with the Peterson Institute for International Economics, who characterized the vote on Friday as a vehicle for Democrats to show their displeasure with aspects of the pact. \u201cThis was a way of them stomping their feet, but in the end I think the president will get his way.\u201d\nBill Lane, director of global government affairs for Caterpillar, echoed Mr. Hufbauer\u2019s view that the door was not completely shut. \u201cEven though the process is temporarily stalled, we are optimistic,\u201d he said.\nMark Grayson, a spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, an industry trade group, said that the group was hopeful \u201cthat the House will pass the bill so it can get to the president\u2019s desk.\u201d\nHe declined to comment on the group\u2019s position on the overall pact, saying it was still being negotiated. But he made clear that the pharmaceutical industry was hoping for what he called \u201cstrong\u201d intellectual property provisions to be included in the trade pact.\nHe dismissed concerns that the pact could limit access to generic drugs, noting that the overwhelming majority of prescriptions filled in the United States were for generic medications, despite strong intellectual property laws in this country.\nGeneric drug industry officials hailed the vote, however.\nHeather Bresch, the chief executive of Mylan, a generic drug maker, applauded the defeat on Friday by the House, saying it would give her more time to lobby against the trade pact. \nShe and other leaders in the generic drug industry have argued that the pact goes too far in protecting the patents of the brand-name drug industry and would block access to generic drugs around the world.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s scary and dangerous that the president is looking for this kind of authority on a trade bill that I think has serious flaws in it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s setting the global generic industry back 30 years.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m thankful for this reconsideration, and I\u2019m going to use this window to try and educate and let our voice be heard,\u201d she said.\nAlthough certainly a minority, a few business groups oppose the trade pact. Unions, environmental groups and many liberals are also opposed. Many critics cited the job losses that followed the signing of North American Free Trade Agreement more than two decades ago.\nThere was also some applause for the defeat from groups like the American Sustainable Business Council, a network of progressive business organizations.\n\u201cThe T.P.P. would give multinational corporations unprecedented power to evade safeguards that protect consumers, workers and the environment. It would hurt smaller, innovative businesses,\u201d said David Levine, the group\u2019s co-founder.\nWhile most economists generally support the White House\u2019s trade agenda, some on the left have kept up a steady drumbeat, warning that it has been structured primarily to advance the interests of Wall Street and major corporations doing business abroad.\n\u201cThe more you learned about the T.P.P., the less it sounded like a simple free trade deal and the more it sounded like a handshake between businesses and investors on all sides of the border,\u201d said Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\nMr. Bernstein, who served as the chief economist to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. from 2009 to 2011, argued that voters were also suspicious about the benefits of trade agreements.\n\u201cMany constituents were deeply uncomfortable,\u201d he said. \u201cMembers from districts where there\u2019s nervousness not just about trade deals but about the impact of globalization on jobs and wages had a hard time saying yes.\u201d\nMany manufacturing giants have been pushing hard to create a broad set of trade rules across major Pacific Rim nations (not including China, however), in part because they already have a major presence in the region. These include companies like General Electric, Honeywell and Cummins. But even a company like Briggs & Stratton, which exports less than 10 percent of what it makes to Asia, stands strongly behind the pact being negotiated.\nIf sales of the gasoline engines for outdoor power equipment that his company makes \u2014 along with Snapper lawn mowers, Simplicity tractors and other products \u2014 are to grow in the future, Mr. Teske, the company\u2019s chief executive, said, new customers in Asia are vital.\nAbout 85 percent of Briggs & Stratton\u2019s products are manufactured in the United States, with factories in Missouri, Kentucky, Nebraska and other states, Mr. Teske said, noting that his work force is efficient enough to be competitive with rival manufacturers in low-wage countries.\n\u201cIf we become isolated as a country,\u201d Mr. Teske said, \u201cthat\u2019s not to our advantage.\u201d", "date": "June 12, 2015", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/13/business/business-leaders-react-with-dismay-to-defeat-of-trade-bill.html", "tags": "defeat leaders generic pact business president react \u201d friday industry trade bill dismay"}
