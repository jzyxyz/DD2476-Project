{"title": "Trump Sweet-Talks Xi, Trying to Ease Trade Fears Before Midterms", "content": "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 When President Trump said Thursday he held a \u201clong and very good conversation\u201d on trade with President Xi Jinping of China, it kicked off a brief rally in financial markets and a flurry of questions about why the tensions between Washington and Beijing had suddenly eased.\nThe answer is, they haven\u2019t really. The explanation for Mr. Trump\u2019s newly soothing tone lies less in the state of trade negotiations \u2014 which remain on hold \u2014 than in the president\u2019s domestic political calculations, particularly in states heavily dependent on trade, like Indiana.\nFour days before a midterm election that features a nip-and-tuck Senate race in this state, Mr. Trump is trying to quell fears of a protracted trade war with China. His reassuring message may resonate in Indiana, the United States\u2019 largest producer of steel but also home to soybean farmers who have been hurt by China\u2019s retaliatory tariffs on American agriculture.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had very good discussions with China,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House, as he left for a pair of political rallies in Indianapolis and Huntington, W.Va. \u201cWe\u2019re getting much closer to doing something. They very much want to make a deal.\u201d\nThe president\u2019s enthusiasm was at odds with his advisers, who said nothing much had changed with Beijing. But it cheered investors in a market increasingly depressed by worries about a trade war. And analysts said it would pacify farmers and factory workers across the Midwest.\nMr. Trump came to Indiana to campaign for Mike Braun, a Republican who is trying to unseat the Democratic incumbent, Senator Joe Donnelly. Mr. Donnelly has a slim lead in the polls, but Mr. Braun has made inroads lately, in part by challenging his opponent on trade.\n\u201cI spoke to President Xi today,\u201d Mr. Trump told a raucous crowd at a high school here. \u201cThey want to make a deal, but we have to have a fair deal. We have to have a deal that\u2019s fair for the United States.\u201d\nThe president took credit for the recently revised North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, which he called a \u201cgiant victory for Indiana farmers, manufacturers and dairy producers.\u201d\nThe trade showdown with China, however, has whipsawed Indiana, benefiting it in some ways while hurting it in others. Steel mills in the industrial north are prospering because of Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs on China and other steel exporters. But soybean farmers are suffering because of the retaliatory tariffs China imposed on agricultural exports.\nCompanies that make auto parts are able to charge higher prices because of a loss of competition from China. But the recreational vehicle industry, one of Indiana\u2019s manufacturing pillars, worries that sales will be hurt if it passes along those higher prices to customers.\n\u201cThe R. V. industry could be in a period of transition,\u201d said Richard Curtin, an economist at the University of Michigan, who studies the industry. A deal with China \u201cwould be widely welcomed,\u201d he said. \u201cThe closer you are to these industries, the more it would be welcomed.\u201d\nMr. Trump\u2019s phone call to Mr. Xi, however, did not appear to be linked to any progress in trade negotiations. Those talks have been on hiatus for weeks, and officials said they did not expect any progress at least until the two presidents meet, which is likely to be at the Group of 20 meeting of industrialized nations in Buenos Aires early next month.\nMr. Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, dismissed reports that Mr. Trump asked his cabinet to draft a trade deal with China and said \u201cthere\u2019s no massive movement\u201d to get something done quickly.\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing a normal, routine run-through of things that we\u2019ve already put together and normal preparation,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said on Friday on CNBC. \u201cWe\u2019re not on the cusp of a deal.\u201d\nStill, after warning for weeks that China was not ready to negotiate on trade with the United States, Mr. Trump took an uncharacteristically conciliatory tone after his call with Mr. Xi, which was both unusually long \u2014 56 minutes \u2014 and initiated by him.\n\u201cWe talked about many subjects, with a heavy emphasis on Trade,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Twitter. \u201cThose discussions are moving along nicely with meetings being scheduled at the G-20 in Argentina.\u201d\nMr. Xi issued a similarly warm statement on Friday, reaffirming the importance of his personal relationship with Mr. Trump and predicting that the two sides could reach a deal. Chinese officials have been taken aback by the vehemence of Mr. Trump\u2019s language against them, and Mr. Xi\u2019s response suggested he was eager to lower the temperature.\nAdministration officials caution that the gulf between the two countries remained wide over issues like market access and China\u2019s alleged purloining of technology from American companies. Any deal, they said, would require specific pledges on the part of the Chinese.\nIn a sign of the administration\u2019s determination to keep up the pressure, the Justice Department took legal action this week against two companies based in China and Taiwan, accusing them of stealing trade secrets from Micron Technology, an American technology company.\nThe Trump administration remains divided internally between officials who want to take an uncompromising approach toward China \u2014 allying the European Union and other trading partners in a united front \u2014 and those who favor cutting some kind of deal.\nIn recent months, Mr. Trump has sided with the hard-liners, though he remains unpredictable, particularly when there are other considerations at play, as his most recent about-face demonstrates.\nMr. Trump, people who know him said, was also motivated by a desire to give the markets a tonic, days before voters go to the polls. The president has regularly boasted about rising stock prices since he took office, but the markets have given up those gains in recent weeks.\nThe Chinese are also seeking to defuse the situation at a time when their own economy and currency are showing signs of weakening.\nStill, they remain confounded by Mr. Trump \u2014 especially his recent claims that they are attempting to interfere in the midterm elections \u2014 and they still feel burned by the president\u2019s rejection of a steel deal negotiated last year by his commerce secretary, Wilbur L. Ross.\nCraig Allen, the president of the U.S.-China Business Council, which represents 200 American companies that do business with China, said Chinese nationalism would make it \u201cdifficult for any Chinese leader to accept anything that is a less than equal agreement.\u201d\nTrade concerns have dominated the Senate race in Indiana, with Mr. Donnelly and Mr. Braun, both of whom have business ties, accusing each other of selling out American workers.\n\u201cI voted against every bad trade deal that hurts Hoosiers,\u201d Mr. Donnelly said in one recent campaign ad, in which he stands next to a pickup truck loaded with boxes of auto parts sold by Mr. Braun\u2019s company \u2014 each bearing a sticker that says, \u201cMade in China.\u201d \u201cMike Braun has used those same deals to outsource Hoosier jobs to China.\u201d\nSome analysts here said they were dubious that Mr. Trump\u2019s shifting tone on trade would drastically change the outcome in Indiana, a state he won by 19 points in 2016 and in which he remains popular.\n\u201cI have been amazed by the steadfast support of farmers for the president,\u201d said Mike Yoder, a Republican who is the commissioner of Elkhart County. \u201cThey have been willing to stick by this president, and if there is some plan for an endgame on tariffs, it has escaped me.\u201d\nBut Mr. Yoder said he welcomed Mr. Trump\u2019s softer tone. Elkhart County is a manufacturing hub, with assembly lines that produce recreational vehicles, as well as trucks and buses. Tariffs on steel and aluminum are driving up the cost of parts for these manufacturers.\n\u201cIt is a good message,\u201d Mr. Yoder said, \u201cbecause for Indiana \u2014 and especially Elkhart County \u2014 these tariffs need to go away.\u201d", "date": "Nov. 2, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/02/us/politics/trump-xi-trade.html", "tags": "sweet-talks midterms xi \u201c china fears trump trade trying ease deal \u2014"}
