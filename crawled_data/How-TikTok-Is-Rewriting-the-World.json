{"title": "How TikTok Is Rewriting the World", "content": "Hello, person who is, statistically speaking, a human adult aged approximately \u201cmillennial\u201d to \u201cboomer.\u201d The analytics suggest a high likelihood that you\u2019re aware there is an app named TikTok, and a similarly high likelihood that you\u2019re not totally sure what it\u2019s all about. Maybe you asked someone younger in your life, and they tried to explain and possibly failed. Or maybe you\u2019ve heard that this new, extraordinarily popular video app is \u201ca refreshing outlier in the social media universe\u201d that\u2019s \u201cgenuinely fun to use.\u201d Maybe you even tried it, but bounced straight out, confused and sapped. \n\u201cFear of missing out\u201d is a common way to describe how social media can make people feel like everyone else is part of something \u2014 a concert, a secret beach, a brunch \u2014 that they\u2019re not. A new wrinkle in this concept is that sometimes that \u201csomething\u201d is a social media platform itself. Maybe you saw a photo of some friends on Instagram at a great party and wondered why you weren\u2019t there. But then, next in your feed, you saw a weird video, watermarked with a vibrating TikTok logo, scored with a song you\u2019d never heard, starring a person you\u2019d never seen. Maybe you saw one of the staggering number of ads for TikTok plastered throughout other social networks, and the real world, and wondered why you weren\u2019t at that party, either, and why it seemed so far away. \nIt\u2019s been a while since a new social app got big enough, quickly enough, to make nonusers feel they\u2019re missing out from an experience. If we exclude Fortnite, which is very social but also very much a game, the last time an app inspired such interest from people who weren\u2019t on it was \u2026 maybe Snapchat? (Not a coincidence that Snapchat\u2019s audience skewed very young, too.) \nAnd while you, perhaps an anxious abstainer, may feel perfectly secure in your \u201cchoice\u201d not to join that service, Snapchat has more daily users than Twitter, changed the course of its industry, and altered the way people communicate with their phones. TikTok, now reportedly 500 million users strong, is not so obvious in its intentions. But that doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t have them! Shall we?\nTikTok is an app for making and sharing short videos. The videos are tall, not square, like on Snapchat or Instagram\u2019s stories, but you navigate through videos by scrolling up and down, like a feed, not by tapping or swiping side to side. \nVideo creators have all sorts of tools at their disposal: filters as on Snapchat (and later, everyone else); the ability to search for sounds to score your video. Users are also strongly encouraged to engage with other users, through \u201cresponse\u201d videos or by means of \u201cduets\u201d \u2014 users can duplicate videos and add themselves alongside. \nHashtags play a surprisingly large role on TikTok. In more innocent times, Twitter hoped its users might congregate around hashtags in a never-ending series of productive pop-up mini-discourses. On TikTok, hashtags actually exist as a real, functional organizing principle: not for news, or even really anything trending anywhere else than TikTok, but for various \u201cchallenges,\u201d or jokes, or repeating formats, or other discernible blobs of activity. \nTikTok is, however, a free-for-all. It\u2019s easy to make a video on TikTok, not just because of the tools it gives users, but because of extensive reasons and prompts it provides for you. You can select from an enormous range of sounds, from popular song clips to short moments from TV shows, YouTube videos or other TikToks. You can join a dare-like challenge, or participate in a dance meme, or make a joke. Or you can make fun of all of these things.\nTikTok assertively answers anyone\u2019s what should I watch with a flood. In the same way, the app provides plenty of answers for the paralyzing what should I post? The result is an endless unspooling of material that people, many very young, might be too self-conscious to post on Instagram, or that they never would have come up with in the first place without a nudge. It can be hard to watch. It can be charming. It can be very, very funny. It is frequently, in the language widely applied outside the platform, from people on other platforms, extremely \u201ccringe.\u201d \nTikTok can feel, to an American audience, a bit like a greatest hits compilation, featuring only the most engaging elements and experiences of its predecessors. This is true, to a point. But TikTok \u2014 known as Douyin in China, where its parent company is based \u2014 must also be understood as one of the most popular of many short-video-sharing apps in that country. This is a landscape that evolved both alongside and at arm\u2019s length from the American tech industry \u2014 Instagram, for example, is banned in China.\nUnder the hood, TikTok is a fundamentally different app than American users have used before. It may look and feel like its friend-feed-centric peers, and you can follow and be followed; of course there are hugely popular \u201cstars,\u201d many cultivated by the company itself. There\u2019s messaging. Users can and do use it like any other social app. But the various aesthetic and functional similarities to Vine or Snapchat or Instagram belie a core difference: TikTok is more machine than man. In this way, it\u2019s from the future \u2014 or at least a future. And it has some messages for us. \nConsider the trajectory of what we think of as the major social apps.\nTwitter gained popularity as a tool for following people and being followed by other people and expanded from there. Twitter watched what its users did with its original concept and formalized the conversational behaviors they invented. (See: Retweets. See again: hashtags.) Only then, and after going public, did it start to become more assertive. It made more recommendations. It started reordering users\u2019 feeds based on what it thought they might want to see, or might have missed. Opaque machine intelligence encroached on the original system. \nSomething similar happened at Instagram, where algorithmic recommendation is now a very noticeable part of the experience, and on YouTube, where recommendations shuttle one around the platform in new and often \u2026 let\u2019s say surprising ways. Some users might feel affronted by these assertive new automatic features, which are clearly designed to increase interaction. One might reasonably worry that this trend serves the lowest demands of a brutal attention economy that is revealing tech companies as cynical time-mongers and turning us into mindless drones. \nThese changes have also tended to work, at least on those terms. We often do spend more time with the apps as they\u2019ve become more assertive, and less intimately human, even as we\u2019ve complained.\nWhat\u2019s both crucial and easy to miss about TikTok is how it has stepped over the midpoint between the familiar self-directed feed and an experience based first on algorithmic observation and inference. The most obvious clue is right there when you open the app: the first thing you see isn\u2019t a feed of your friends, but a page called \u201cFor You.\u201d It\u2019s an algorithmic feed based on videos you\u2019ve interacted with, or even just watched. It never runs out of material. It is not, unless you train it to be, full of people you know, or things you\u2019ve explicitly told it you want to see. It\u2019s full of things that you seem to have demonstrated you want to watch, no matter what you actually say you want to watch.\nIt is constantly learning from you and, over time, builds a presumably complex but opaque model of what you tend to watch, and shows you more of that, or things like that, or things related to that, or, honestly, who knows, but it seems to work. TikTok starts making assumptions the second you\u2019ve opened the app, before you\u2019ve really given it anything to work with. Imagine an Instagram centered entirely around its \u201cExplore\u201d tab, or a Twitter built around, I guess, trending topics or viral tweets, with \u201cfollowing\u201d bolted onto the side.\nImagine a version of Facebook that was able to fill your feed before you\u2019d friended a single person. That\u2019s TikTok.\nIts mode of creation is unusual, too. You can make stuff for your friends, or in response to your friends, sure. But users looking for something to post about are immediately recruited into group challenges, or hashtags, or shown popular songs. The bar is low. The stakes are low. Large audiences feel within reach, and smaller ones are easy to find, even if you\u2019re just messing around.\nOn most social networks the first step to showing your content to a lot of people is grinding to build an audience, or having lots of friends, or being incredibly beautiful or wealthy or idle and willing to display that, or getting lucky or striking viral gold. TikTok instead encourages users to jump from audience to audience, trend to trend, creating something like simulated temporary friend groups, who get together to do friend-group things: to share an inside joke; to riff on a song; to talk idly and aimlessly about whatever is in front of you. Feedback is instant and frequently abundant; virality has a stiff tailwind. Stimulation is constant. There is an unmistakable sense that you\u2019re using something that\u2019s expanding in every direction. The pool of content is enormous. Most of it is meaningless. Some of it becomes popular, and some is great, and some gets to be both. As The Atlantic\u2019s Taylor Lorenz put it, \u201cWatching too many in a row can feel like you\u2019re about to have a brain freeze. They\u2019re incredibly addictive.\u201d\nIn 1994, the artist and software developer Karl Sims demonstrated \u201cvirtual creatures\u201d that moved in realistic ways discovered through \u201cgenetic algorithms.\u201d These simulations, through trial and error, gradually arrived at some pre-existing shapes and movements: wriggling, slithering, dragging and walking. \nBut some early models, which emphasized the creatures\u2019 ability to cover a certain distance as quickly as possible, resulted in the evolution of a very tall, rigid being that simply fell over. In doing so, it \u201cmoved\u201d more quickly than a wriggling peer. It didn\u2019t understand its evolutionary priority as \u201ccreature-like locomotion.\u201d It needed to get to a certain place as efficiently as possible. And it did. \nOlder social apps are continuously evolving, too. Their models prioritize growth and discovery, of course, but also assume the centrality of your people: the accounts you follow and which follow you, or with whom you communicate directly, and are bound up in their founding myths and structures: Facebook\u2019s social graph; the News Feed; the Instagram feed; Twitter\u2019s rigid user relationships. \nTikTok though is the towering stick falling far and fast, not caring to wait to evolve through a wriggling, cumbersome social phase, but instead asking: Why not just start showing people things and see what they do about it? Why not just ask people to start making things and see what happens? If engagement is how success is measured, why not just design the app where taking up time is the entire point? There\u2019s no rule, in apps or elsewhere, against engagement for engagement\u2019s sake. Let the creature grow tall and fall upon us all. \nTikTok is far from an evolutionary fluke. Its parent company, ByteDance, recently valued at more than $75 billion, bills itself first as an artificial intelligence company, not a creator of mission-driven social platforms. TikTok was merged with Musical.ly, a social network initially built around lip-syncing and dancing and adopted by very young people. It still carries a lot of Musical.ly\u2019s DNA, and its app store reviews contain more than a little yearning for Musical.ly\u2019s return. It was the defunct Musical.ly against which the Federal Trade Commission recently levied its largest-ever penalty for mishandling the private data of young users.\n\u201cByteDance\u2019s content platforms enable people to enjoy content powered by AI technology,\u201d its website says. Its vision is \u201cto build global creation and interaction platforms.\u201d ByteDance\u2019s wildly popular news and entertainment portal, Jinri Toutiao (translated as \u201cToday\u2019s Headlines,\u201d) relies heavily on AI \u2014\u00a0not human editors, or a self-selected feed of accounts \u2014 to curate and create customized streams of largely user-and-partner-generated content tailored to each of its readers. \nThese are services where a sort of \u201cfilter\u201d bubble \u2014 isolating users into worlds of points of view \u2014 isn\u2019t an unintended consequence. It\u2019s the point. And it\u2019s extremely effective: Both Toutiao and Douyin have drawn attention from Chinese regulators for, among many other things, some familiar to any large social-ish platform, and others unique to its speech-constrained political environment, capturing too much user time. As a result, TikTok\u2019s \u201cDigital Wellbeing\u201d settings include an option to enforce a password-protected time limit. The company\u2019s other challenges can be addressed more assertively: an algorithm-first attention market isn\u2019t just centrally ruled, it\u2019s centrally allocated.\nAll of this goes a long way to explain why, at least at first, TikTok can seem disorienting. \u201cYou\u2019re not actually sure why you\u2019re seeing what you\u2019re seeing,\u201d said Ankur Thakkar, the former editorial lead at Vine, TikTok\u2019s other most direct forerunner. On Vine, a new user might not have had much to watch, or felt much of a reason to create anything, but they understood their context: the list of people they followed, which was probably the thing letting them down. \n\u201cIt\u2019s doing the thing that Twitter tried to solve, that everyone tried to solve,\u201d he said. \u201cHow do you get people to engage?\u201d Apparently you just \u2026 show them things, and let a powerful artificial intelligence take notes. You start sending daily notifications immediately. You tell them what to do. You fake it till you make it, algorithmically speaking. \nAmerican social platforms, each fighting their own desperate and often stock-price-related fights to increase user engagement, have been trending in TikTok\u2019s general direction for a while. It is possible, today, to receive highly personalized and effectively infinite content recommendations in YouTube without ever following a single account, because Google already watches what you do, and makes guesses about who you are. And while Facebook and Twitter don\u2019t talk about their products this way, we understand that sometimes \u2014\u00a0maybe a lot of the time \u2014\u00a0we use them just to fill time. They, in turn, want as much of our time as possible, and are quite obviously doing whatever they can to get it.\nSo maybe you\u2019ll sit TikTok out. But these things have a way of sneaking up behind you. Maybe you never joined Snapchat \u2014 but its rise worried Facebook so much that its prettier product, Instagram, was remade in its image, and copied concepts from Snapchat reached you there.\nAnd maybe you skipped Twitter \u2014 but it still rewired your entire news diet, and, besides, it\u2019s how the president talks to you, now. \nTikTok does away with many of the assumptions other social platforms have been built upon, and which they are in the process of discarding anyway. It questions the primacy of individual connections and friend networks. It unapologetically embraces central control rather than pretending it doesn\u2019t have it. TikTok\u2019s real influence going forward may be that the other social media platforms decide that our friends were simply holding us back. Or, at least, it was holding them back.
