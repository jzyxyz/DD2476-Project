{"title": "Death Of Obamacare Repeal Could Spur New Medicaid Expansions", "content": "The failure of President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans to repeal the Affordable Care Act could lead to an ironic result: the expansion of government-run health care.\nThe Affordable Care Act provides generous federal funding to states that expand their Medicaid programs starting in 2014, but 19 states led by Republicans or by divided partisan control of their governments declined to do so after a 2012 Supreme Court ruling made it optional.\nNow that the federal effort to repeal and replace \u201cObamacare\u201d is dead, states that turned down those federal dollars to cover their poorest residents may revisit the idea to open up Medicaid\u00a0\u2015 which is jointly managed and financed by the federal and state governments\u00a0\u2015 to more people.\nThe Republican-led Kansas Senate passed a bill Monday to expand Medicaid in the Sunflower State, following passage by the majority-GOP Kansas House last month. This legislation had been moving before the collapse of the congressional repeal effort, but it illustrates interest in red states in covering more people using Affordable Care Act funding. Republican Gov. Sam Brownback opposes the bill, however, making its fate uncertain.\u00a0\nAlso Monday, one Democrat\u00a0began to take action in the aftermath of Trump\u2019s failed bid to undo Obamacare. \nVirginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, stymied by the GOP-led legislature in his attempts to enact Medicaid expansion in his commonwealth after taking office in 2014, announced Monday he would renew his push to get the legislature to adopt the policy now that Trump and national GOP leaders like House Speaker Paul Ryan (Wis.) have moved on from repeal.\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act failed and even Speaker Ryan has said that Obamacare is the law of the land for the foreseeable future,\u201d McAuliffe said in a news release. \u201cI\u2019m asking the General Assembly to work with me to pursue Medicaid expansion and put this funding to work for our most vulnerable Virginians.\u201d\nMcAuliffe campaigned in support of Medicaid expansion, so his statements aren\u2019t surprising. But his thinking could spread to even Republican governors and state legislators, said Diane Rowland, executive vice president of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\u201cThere is now a motivation to many of those states who were on the fence to take it,\u201d Rowland said. \u201cThey could cover a lot of low-income people with a lot of federal money.\u201d\nAnother ironic twist is that having a Republican in the White House could make state GOP leaders more willing to negotiate with federal health care authorities on so-called waivers from standard Medicaid rules that would let states nudge their Medicaid expansions in more conservative directions. States like Arkansas and Indiana made such arrangements with President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, but didn\u2019t always get what they wanted.\n\u201cThey now have an administration that\u2019s very willing to do waivers and set up some of the kinds of things they wanted to have in an expansion, like a work requirement,\u201d Rowland said.\nTrump\u2019s top Medicare and Medicaid official, Seema Verma, is a strong proponent of state innovation in Medicaid and was a key figure in the development of the Healthy Indiana Medicaid expansion that Vice President Mike Pence implemented while governor of that state. \nThe Trump administration would be more willing to allow states to impose rules on Medicaid recipients that the Obama administration wouldn\u2019t approve, such as work requirements, higher monthly premiums and higher costs when patients use their Medicaid benefits.\nGeorgia Gov. Nathan Deal, a Republican, also indicated Monday that the demise of the federal repeal effort may change his thinking about Medicaid. \n\u201cThose are areas that some would like for us to explore, and I think we have the possibility of doing that within the context of our Medicaid program,\u201d he said, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. Deal did not specify that he would take up the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Medicaid expansion, but expressed an interest in seeking Medicaid waivers from the federal government.\nExpansions in the other 31 states and the District of Columbia strongly contributed to the historic reduction in the national uninsured rate, and those localities saw greater success than non-expansion states. \nIn addition to extending coverage to more people, these Medicaid expansions have been shown to reduce premiums for private health insurance by moving sicker, costlier people to Medicaid instead, and to stimulate local economies as federal dollars flow through the state to medical providers and others. \nUnder the Affordable Care Act, the federal government pays no less than 90 percent of the cost to cover newly eligible people, which includes anyone earning up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, or about $16,000 a year for a single person.\nMovement could pick up now that the Affordable Care Act seems secure from repeal, including in states that had actively debated Medicaid expansion in recent years but not gone through with it, such as South Dakota and Maine.\nIn Maine, GOP Gov. Paul LePage has vetoed several bills to expand Medicaid passed by the state\u2019s divided legislature, most recently last year. But Mainers will get a chance to vote on expansion in a referendum this November. \nIn 2015, South Dakota Gov. Dennis Daugaard (R) ended his opposition to broadening Medicaid expansion and began work on\u00a0an unusual proposal to expand Medicaid while also seeking to improve health care access for Native Americans in his state who have Indian Health Service benefits. \nDaugaard courted the state\u2019s majority-GOP legislature and coordinated with the Obama administration in drafting his plan. But the governor dropped it at Pence\u2019s urging shortly after Trump won the presidential election last year, a decision he may reconsider now that repeal isn\u2019t looming.\nCORRECTION: This article previously misstated that Democrats controlled Maine\u2019s legislature; they control Maine\u2019s House, and Republicans control its Senate.", "date": "\n03/27/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/death-of-obamacare-repeal-could-spur-new-medicaid-expansions_n_58d99531e4b018c4606ab8b7", "tags": "expansions obamacare expansion death repeal medicaid states federal act spur state could affordable new care"}
