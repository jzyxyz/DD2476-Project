{"title": "Alabama Senate Passes Nation's Strictest Abortion Bill", "content": "Alabama is one signature away from enacting a near-total ban on abortions after the state Senate passed a controversial bill that makes performing the procedure a felony offense.\nUnder the Human Life Protection Act, doctors who perform an abortion at any stage of pregnancy could face a minimum sentence of 10 years in prison.\u00a0The only exception in the legislation is in cases where the life of the pregnant woman is at risk.\nThe bill passed on Tuesday, 25 to 6.\nBefore the vote, the Republican-controlled Senate rejected an amendment that would have allowed abortions for pregnancies caused by rape and incest.\nThe Alabama House passed the same bill\u00a0late last month. If Gov. Kay Ivey (R) signs it into law \u2015 she has not publicly made up her mind \u2015 it would become effective within six months.\n\u201cWomen in this state didn\u2019t deserve this,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Bobby Singleton in a fiery speech on Tuesday evening. \u201cThe state of Alabama ought to be ashamed of itself.\u201d\nThe Senate\u2019s passage of the bill came just days after chaos broke out on the Senate floor\u00a0over the legislation. Last Thursday, Republican and Democratic lawmakers engaged in a screaming match after some GOP lawmakers attempted to remove the exemptions for rape and incest without holding an official vote. Ultimately, the Democrats\u2019 resistance was not enough.\nThe upheaval over the rape and incest exemptions led to the Senate vote being postponed until Tuesday.\nThe Human Life Protection Act notes that Alabama has never repealed a state law criminalizing abortion, but because of the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade, that law is unenforceable.\nState Rep. Terri Collins (R), who sponsored the new legislation, has been outspoken about her intent to change that.\n\u201cThis bill is very simple,\u201d she told The Washington Post. \u201cIt\u2019s not about birth control or the morning after the pill. It\u2019s about not allowing abortion once the woman is pregnant. The entire bill was designed to overturn [Roe v. Wade] and allow states to decide what is best for them.\u201d\nEric Johnston, who drafted the legislation as president of the Alabama Pro-Life Coalition, said he was confident the governor would sign the bill. It is his hope that the law will be challenged, he said, and will eventually be reviewed by the Supreme Court.\nHe applauded the legislature for not adding any exceptions to the bill.\n\u201cIt is a traumatic event, and I don\u2019t want to diminish how serious it is,\u201d he said, referring to rape and incest. \u201cBut if we are arguing personhood then it does not matter how a child is conceived.\u201d\nReproductive rights groups immediately protested the bill\u2019s passage, calling the measure blatantly unconstitutional. It is believed to be the strictest abortion restriction in the country.\n\u201cIn passing this atrocious bill, Alabama\u2019s state legislators have shown their complete disregard for the U.S. Constitution and the needs of their constituents,\u201d said Katherine Ragsdale, CEO of the National Abortion Federation, in a statement. \u201cAnti-choice politicians have once again demonstrated that they would rather advance their extreme personal agenda than ensure the safety and well-being of their constituents.\u201d\nAlexa Kolbi-Molinas, senior staff attorney at the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project, said the state should expect a lawsuit if the bill is signed into law.\u00a0\n\u201cAlabama\u2019s bill is the anti-abortion opposition\u2019s true agenda on full display \u2014 ban abortion, punish women, jail doctors, and shame people seeking care,\u201d Kolbi-Molinas said. \u201cWe will not stand by while politicians endanger the lives of women and doctors for political gain.\u201d\nAllison Coleman, 31, a sexual assault survivor from Birmingham, Alabama, watched the debate on the abortion ban in an overflow room at the statehouse. Her name was brought up by Democrats an example of the type of victim who would be denied an abortion under the new legislation.\u00a0\nColeman told HuffPost that she was inspired by the passion of the Alabama Democrats, but \u201chorrified and alienated by the heartlessness of the right.\u201d\nAlabama has only three abortion clinics left in the state.\u00a0\nThis has been updated throughout.", "date": "\n05/14/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/alabama-senate-abortion-bill-passes_n_5cd9fba1e4b073aa0b3266d9", "tags": "passes alabama legislation \u201d strictest senate abortion state bill nation"}
