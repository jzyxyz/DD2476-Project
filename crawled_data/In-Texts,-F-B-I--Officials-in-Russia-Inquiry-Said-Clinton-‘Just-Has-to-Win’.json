{"title": "In Texts, F.B.I. Officials in Russia Inquiry Said Clinton \u2018Just Has to Win\u2019", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Senior F.B.I. officials who helped investigate Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign last year wrote in text messages that Hillary Clinton \u201cjust has to win\u201d and described a potential Trump victory as \u201cterrifying,\u201d according to texts released Tuesday night.\nA top counterintelligence agent, Peter Strzok, exchanged the messages with Lisa Page, a senior F.B.I. lawyer. Some messages criticized Mrs. Clinton\u2019s team, the Obama administration, Congress and other Democrats. But the two appeared appalled at some of Mr. Trump\u2019s comments during the campaign and feared that he would politicize the F.B.I.\nFor example, after Mr. Trump made an apparent sexual allusion related to the size of his hands, Ms. Page wrote: \u201cThis man cannot be president.\u201d In another exchange, Mr. Strzok wrote of a potential Trump presidency, \u201cI\u2019m scared for our organization.\u201d He also referred to Mr. Trump as a \u201cdouche.\u201d The messages were turned over to Congress and obtained by The New York Times.\nMr. Strzok went on to become one of the top investigators for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. But over the summer, Mr. Mueller removed Mr. Strzok from his team as soon as he became aware of the texts. Their release is certain to fuel suspicion among Republicans that the investigation into connections between the Trump campaign and Russia was politically motivated from the beginning.\nThe Justice Department\u2019s inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, is investigating the texts as part of a wide-ranging inquiry into how the F.B.I. handled its investigations into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s personal email server and of the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia. It is highly unusual for the government to release these types of documents until such an investigation is complete. The move caught internal investigators by surprise.\nF.B.I. regulations allow agents to express opinions \u201cas an individual privately and publicly on political subjects and candidates.\u201d\nOn July 27, Ms. Page wrote, \u201cShe just has to win now. I\u2019m not going to lie, I got a flash of nervousness yesterday about Trump.\u201d That text message was sent after the Clinton investigation had been closed. Days later, the F.B.I. began investigating possible coordination between Russian officials and the Trump campaign.\nThe two F.B.I. officials also criticized Mr. Trump as the Russia investigation was continuing. They told internal investigators that their comments were influenced by the troubling evidence they were seeing about Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign ties to Russia, according to a person familiar with the internal investigation.\nF.B.I. officials who worked directly with Mr. Strzok on the Clinton and Trump investigations said they never detected any bias in his investigative work. The F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray, said last week at a congressional hearing that he could not discuss the texts because of the continuing investigation. But Mr. Wray said that he would \u201chold people accountable after there has been an appropriate investigation, independent and objective, by the inspector general into the handling of the prior matter.\u201d\nThe F.B.I. declined to comment. Mr. Strzok, a former Army officer, and Ms. Page, a prosecutor who started her government career right out of law school, are career officials, not political appointees.\nMr. Strzok had been considered one of the most experienced and trusted F.B.I. counterintelligence investigators. Mr. Mueller removed him after the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general discovered the texts. Mr. Strzok helped lead the bureau\u2019s investigation into whether Mrs. Clinton had mishandled classified information on her private email account. After that investigation was closed in the summer of 2016, he became the top agent on the investigation into links between Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia.\nMr. Strzok described himself in one text as a \u201cconservative Dem.\u201d In another, he said: \u201cI am worried about what Trump is encouraging in our behavior. The things that made me proud about our tolerance for dissent.\u201d Ms. Page replied that she was worried about a Clinton presidency, reflecting the mood of many in the public who disliked both candidates.\nThe New York Times revealed the existence of the texts on Dec. 2. After that article, Mr. Trump seized on the messages, sharply criticizing the F.B.I. in a series of Twitter posts. Mr. Trump said the F.B.I. was the \u201cworst in History\u201d and \u201cits reputation is in Tatters.\u201d\n\u201cReport: \u2018ANTI-TRUMP FBI AGENT LED CLINTON EMAIL PROBE,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump said on Twitter on Dec. 3. \u201cNow it all starts to make sense!\u201d\nThe Justice Department\u2019s decision to provide the texts to Capitol Hill in the middle of an investigation is also likely to attract scrutiny from Democrats. Mr. Trump has criticized the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, for not doing enough to protect him on the Russia investigation.\nBy releasing the texts, the Justice Department has given Mr. Trump both a shield and a sword in his political battle with Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigators.", "date": "Dec. 12, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/12/us/fbi-trump-russia.html", "tags": "\u2018 f.b.i officials texts inquiry clinton win investigation \u201d trump strzok russia campaign said"}
