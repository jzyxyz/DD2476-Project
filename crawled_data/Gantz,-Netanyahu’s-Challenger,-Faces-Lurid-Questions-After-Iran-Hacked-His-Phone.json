{"title": "Gantz, Netanyahu\u2019s Challenger, Faces Lurid Questions After Iran Hacked His Phone", "content": "NAHAL OZ, Israel \u2014 Benny Gantz, Israel\u2019s former army chief, is campaigning to lead his country as the clean, moral alternative to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who faces indictment in a corruption scandal.\nBut less than a month before the election, Mr. Gantz found himself fielding seamy-sounding questions late Friday about whether he had committed adultery, opened himself up to possible extortion or sandbagged his political allies to advance his own career.\nThe awkward news appearance here at a kibbutz near the Gaza Strip followed a report on Israeli television that Mr. Gantz\u2019s cellphone had been hacked by Iranian intelligence after his entry into politics in December and that personal and professional information had been stolen.\nMr. Gantz retired from the military in 2015, so the issue is not whether classified information might now be in enemy hands, but that he could be vulnerable to blackmail if elected. The hack threatened to set back his bid, which polls have shown has the strongest chance of any opposition politician to depose Mr. Netanyahu. With rumors flying about what might have been harvested from Mr. Gantz\u2019s cellphone, his party, the Blue and White, issued a statement saying the stolen data included \u201cno security information, no embarrassing videos, and he was never a target of blackmail.\u201d\nThat was not enough to put a lid on the speculation, however, and so the laconic Mr. Gantz, whose campaign strategy has entailed saying as little as possible, hastily arranged his first news conference.\nHis backdrop was the Gaza border, where a wave of Israeli airstrikes hit early Friday after two Hamas rockets had reached Tel Aviv for the first time since the summerlong war of 2014. That allowed Mr. Gantz, who prosecuted that war as army chief, to try to shame the Israeli press into focusing on more sober matters.\n\u201cWe are here in a story of an ongoing security event,\u201d Mr. Gantz said, glowering in front of a barbed-wire fence, to dozens of journalists who had trekked the hour from Tel Aviv or Jerusalem shortly before the start of the Sabbath. \u201cAnd in the reality we are in, someone suddenly broke some political, gossipy and completely delusional story.\u201d\nGiven that his party\u2019s statement said there were no videos, he was asked, might there be embarrassing photos or correspondence? \u201cI\u2019m not going to stoop to that place,\u201d he said, calling it \u201cunethical nosiness.\u201d\nDid he ever have a relationship with a woman that could be the basis for extortion? another reporter ventured. \u201cI\u2019m not subject to extortion under any circumstances,\u201d he said, again refusing to go there.\nMr. Gantz\u2019s centrist Blue and White party is leading Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s Likud in the polls in terms of the number of Parliament\u2019s 120 seats it is expected to win. But the prime ministership is determined based on which leader can forge a majority governing coalition, a measure on which Mr. Gantz and his partners trail the incumbent and his right-wing allies.\nOn Friday, Mr. Gantz flatly accused the prime minister of being \u201cbehind the reports about the telephone.\u201d\nMr. Gantz was informed of the hacking in early February by the Shin Bet, Israel\u2019s domestic security service. That was before he joined forces with Yair Lapid, a former finance minister whose Yesh Atid party was trailing Mr. Gantz in the polls. Mr. Lapid agreed to let Mr. Gantz sit at the top of the ticket under an agreement that would have them swap the prime ministership midstream if they win.\nBut Mr. Gantz did not apprise Mr. Lapid of the Iranian hack before striking that deal. In fact, Blue and White party officials said on Friday, Mr. Lapid and the two other former army chiefs of staff running alongside Mr. Gantz, Moshe Yaalon and Gabi Ashkenazi, were not informed of the breach until shortly before Thursday\u2019s television report.\nAsked why he had not apprised his political brethren sooner, Mr. Gantz was dismissive. \u201cYair and the others aren\u2019t relevant to this story,\u201d he said.\nNone of his three comrades, who have routinely campaigned alongside Mr. Gantz, joined him at the late-Friday news conference \u2014 though all three publicly echoed his contention that Mr. Netanyahu, who oversees the Shin Bet, had orchestrated the leak to damage him.\nMr. Lapid said Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s \u201cuse of sensitive security material to try to smear Benny Gantz proves he is scared of him.\u201d And Mr. Yaalon told a TV interviewer that Mr. Netanyahu wanted to distract attention from the criminal cases in which he is accused of bribery, fraud and breach of trust.\nThe prime minister\u2019s office said that the chief of the Shin Bet, who reports directly to Mr. Netanyahu, had not briefed him or his aides about the hacking. His Likud party denied any hand in the leak.\nA security official involved in the matter said that Iran\u2019s Ministry of Intelligence and Security, which has been engaged in a long-running spy-vs.-spy battle with Israel\u2019s Mossad on multiple continents, had hacked Mr. Gantz\u2019s phone and was behind a series of other cyber attacks against Israel.\nThe incident was reminiscent of one early in Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s rise to power. In 1993, he admitted to having an extramarital affair after he said anonymous rivals had threatened to release a compromising videotape. No tape was ever produced, and Mr. Netanyahu accused an archrival of being behind the scandal.", "date": "March 15, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/world/middleeast/gantz-netanyahus-challenger-faces-lurid-questions-after-iran-hacked-his-phone.html", "tags": "iran faces lurid security prime party \u201d israel gantz netanyahu challenger questions hacked phone"}
