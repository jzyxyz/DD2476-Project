{"title": "The GOP's New Pre-Existing Conditions Promise Is A Fraud", "content": "Making sure people who have pre-existing health conditions don\u2019t get screwed by health insurance companies is very popular. So popular that a bunch of Republican\u00a0senators who are freaked out about the party\u2019s electoral prospects have introduced legislation to guarantee that no Americans may be denied coverage because of their medical history.\nAt least that\u2019s what the senators\u00a0say it will do. Here\u2019s the thing, though: That\u2019s bogus. \nThe debut of this\u00a0phony bill Friday is the latest installment in Republicans\u2019\u00a0long-running campaign to make the health care system worse for anyone who has ever been sick while loudly proclaiming they are doing the opposite. \nCongressional Republicans spent a good chunk of last year trying to repeal all or most of the Affordable Care Act, for instance, which already dealt with the problems of people with pre-existing conditions being shut out of health coverage or charged exorbitant rates. Against all evidence, these lawmakers constantly denied what they were doing, so we\u2019ve seen this before.\nAt first glance, the new legislation mimics the Affordable Care Act\u2019s provisions for people with pre-existing conditions. And that\u2019s what the bill\u2019s sponsors \u2014 GOP Sens. Thom Tillis (N.C.), Lamar Alexander (Tenn.), Chuck Grassley (Iowa), Joni Ernst (Iowa), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Bill Cassidy (La.), Roger Wicker (Miss.), Lindsey Graham (S.C.), Dean Heller (Nev.) and John Barrasso (Wyo.) \u2014 want you to believe.\nRight there in the text, it says health insurance companies would not be allowed to deny an individual coverage or charge extra because of \u201chealth status, medical condition (including both physical and mental illnesses), claims experience, receipt of health care, medical history, genetic information, evidence of insurability (including conditions arising out of acts of domestic violence), disability, [or] any other health status-related factor determined appropriate by the Secretary [of Health and Human Services].\u201d\nBut it\u2019s what the bill doesn\u2019t say that makes the above mostly meaningless.\nYes, insurance companies wouldn\u2019t be allowed to refuse to offer coverage to someone who, for example, has a history of cancer or is pregnant. But they could sell someone a policy that doesn\u2019t cover cancer treatments or the birth of a child. \nSure, premiums wouldn\u2019t be allowed to vary based on health status or pre-existing conditions. But prices could dramatically vary based on age, gender, occupation and other factors, including hobbies, in ways that are functionally the same as basing them on medical histories.\u00a0Insurance companies have a lot of experience figuring out that stuff.\nThere\u2019s no need to speculate about how insurance companies would respond to this, because this is how the system worked for people who bought individual policies before the Affordable Care Act. Insurers don\u2019t make money paying claims; they make money by avoiding claims or refusing the pay them. If they\u2019re allowed to keep the most expensive people and treatments off their books, they will.\nBefore the Affordable Care Act, it already was illegal for health insurance companies to reject customers with pre-existing conditions or charge them more based on their medical histories if they got coverage through a group plan, like from an employer. And insurers and employers are limited in how much they could refuse to pay for treatments related to a pre-existing condition for group policyholders. The Affordable Care Act extended similar protections to people who buy their health insurance directly or via the exchanges the law created.\nWith\u00a0Obamacare\u00a0repeal off the legislative agenda \u2015\u00a0for now, at least\u00a0\u2015 why would these senators write legislation to solve a problem that doesn\u2019t exist? Because their party is the middle of unsolving it.\nRepublican officials from 20 states are asking a federal judge in Texas to\u00a0overturn the entire Affordable Care Act, which would include its provisions guaranteeing access to insurance for people with pre-existing conditions.\nPresident\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s Justice Department decided not to defend the law in court, which is not the normal way the department handles cases challenging federal laws. The administration, however, doesn\u2019t want to throw out the whole law \u2015\u00a0just the parts\u00a0that protect people with pre-existing conditions. Some\u00a0Democratic\u00a0state officials have stepped to take the federal government\u2019s place and fight the lawsuit.\nIt\u2019s a head-scratching political move. During an election year that\u2019s shaping up to be a disaster for the Republican Party, its national leader and prominent officials around the country are taking a strong stand against enabling sick people to go to the doctor.\nAccording to a poll conducted last month by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, 64 percent of Americans surveyed said they\u00a0do not want\u00a0the courts to do this, with 62 percent of respondents saying a candidate\u2019s position on pre-existing conditions is \u201cvery important\u201d or the \u201cmost important\u201d factor in whom they will support.\nAt the same time, the administration is loosening regulations on\u00a0certain types of health insurance policies\u00a0to allow insurers to refuse coverage for pre-existing conditions. That\u2019s part of Trump\u2019s\u00a0ongoing campaign to sabotage\u00a0the Affordable Care Act\u2019s health insurance markets.\nSo in that context, it makes sense that these senators would want to have a bill they can cite as evidence that they don\u2019t think people with pre-existing conditions should be excluded from the health care system. The legislation doesn\u2019t actually do that, but it\u2019s enough for a campaign ad.\nFurthermore, some of the Republicans involved in this pre-existing conditions mess are particularly vulnerable.\nHeller, for example, is facing a major challenge to his re-election in large part because of his\u00a0flip-flopping on Affordable Care Act repeal\u00a0and eventual support for the last version of the legislation to replace it. That bill was the brainchild of Cassidy and Graham and\u00a0absolutely would have weakened\u00a0pre-existing condition protections.\nWest Virginia Attorney General\u00a0Patrick Morrisey\u00a0(R), one of the officials who brought the lawsuit, is running for\u00a0Senate\u00a0\u2014 which the state\u2019s Sen.\u00a0Joe Manchin\u00a0(D) never tires of bringing up. Likewise, Sen.\u00a0Claire McCaskill\u00a0(D-Mo.) also is more than happy to talk about how her opponent, state Attorney General\u00a0Josh Hawley\u00a0(R), also one of the leaders in that case.\nVoters will have to decide what\u2019s more believable: That 10 Republican senators are standing up for Americans who have pre-existing conditions or that this is a sham being perpetrated by the party that has spent the past two years trying to do the opposite.", "date": "\n08/24/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/gop-pre-existing-condition-promise-fraud_n_5b8053bfe4b0cd327dfc8a1c", "tags": "promise coverage health pre-existing gop companies conditions insurance act affordable new care fraud"}
