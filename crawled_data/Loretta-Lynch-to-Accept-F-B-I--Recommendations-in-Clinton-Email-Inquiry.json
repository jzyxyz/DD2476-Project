{"title": "Loretta Lynch to Accept F.B.I. Recommendations in Clinton Email Inquiry", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch, conceding that her airport meeting with former President Bill Clinton this week had cast a shadow over the federal investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s personal email account, said Friday that she would accept whatever recommendations career prosecutors and the F.B.I. director made about whether to bring charges in the case.\nMs. Lynch said she had decided this spring to defer to the recommendations of her staff and the F.B.I. because her status as a political appointee sitting in judgment on a politically charged case would raise questions of a conflict of interest. But the meeting with Mr. Clinton, she acknowledged, had deepened those questions, and she said she now felt compelled to explain publicly her reasoning to try to put the concerns to rest.\n\u201cPeople have a whole host of reasons to have questions about how we in government do our business,\u201d Ms. Lynch said at an Aspen Institute conference in Colorado. \u201cMy meeting on the plane with former President Clinton could give them another reason to have questions and concerns.\u201d\nThough she insisted the 30-minute conversation was a purely social encounter, Ms. Lynch said, \u201cI certainly wouldn\u2019t do it again.\u201d\nThe attorney general\u2019s response did little to quell a political tempest in Washington, with some Republicans calling for her to recuse herself from the case \u2014 a step she said she was not going to take. Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, said the meeting had \u201copened up a Pandora\u2019s box.\u201d He cast doubt on whether it was entirely social, citing it as an example of how \u201cthe special interests are controlling your government.\u201d\nFor Democrats, already anxious about the political impact of the email investigation, the incident revived fears that Mr. Clinton could become a rogue actor in a campaign that has so far operated more smoothly than Mrs. Clinton\u2019s presidential bid in 2008.\nMr. Clinton, who was on a seven-state fund-raising swing for his wife, strode across the tarmac at the airport in Phoenix to greet Ms. Lynch after her plane landed there on Monday night. The attorney general joked that she should have acted more swiftly to keep him from boarding. Asked by a journalist to name one thing she wished her predecessor, Eric H. Holder Jr., had told her about her job, she replied, \u201cWhere the lock on the plane door was.\u201d\nStill, Ms. Lynch said the episode was personally distressing because it stained the reputation of the Justice Department. \u201cThe fact that the meeting that I had is now casting a shadow over how people are going to view that work is something that I take seriously, and deeply and painfully,\u201d she said.\nEven Ms. Lynch\u2019s explanation of how she planned to distance herself from the case \u2014 without recusing herself \u2014 required further clarification. \u201cThe case will be resolved by the team that\u2019s been working on it from the beginning,\u201d she said in Aspen. But a Justice Department spokeswoman, Melanie Newman, noted afterward that even if Ms. Lynch accepted the recommendation of her staff, she would be the one making the decision.\n\u201cShe\u2019s the head of the department,\u201d Ms. Newman said, \u201cand with that comes ultimate responsibility for any decision.\u201d\nThe White House declined to comment on Ms. Lynch\u2019s decision. President Obama \u201cbelieves that this matter should be handled without regard to politics,\u201d the press secretary, Josh Earnest, said.\nThe F.B.I. is investigating whether Mrs. Clinton, her aides or anyone else broke the law by setting up a private email server for her to use as secretary of state. Internal investigators have concluded that the server was used to send classified information. For the Justice Department, the central question is whether the conduct met the legal standard for the crime of mishandling classified information.\nMs. Lynch, whom Mr. Clinton appointed to be a United States attorney in 1999, said that the meeting with the former president was unplanned and largely social, and did not touch on the email investigation.\n\u201cHe said hello and we basically said hello, and congratulated him on his grandchildren, as people do,\u201d said Ms. Lynch, who was traveling with her husband. \u201cThat led to a conversation about those grandchildren.\u201d\nFor Mr. Clinton, who travels frequently by private jet, such airport socializing is common. Last month, he ran into Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, after speaking at the funeral of Muhammad Ali in Louisville, Ky. The two chatted before their planes took off. He has also greeted Representative Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker, and Arnold Schwarzenegger, the former Republican governor of California, on the tarmac. And in Mobile, Ala., he chatted with Senator Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican who has called for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s imprisonment.\nThis meeting, however, created a particularly awkward situation for Ms. Lynch, a veteran prosecutor who was nominated from outside Washington\u2019s political circles. During her confirmation, her allies sought to contrast her with her predecessor, Mr. Holder, an outspoken liberal voice who clashed frequently with Republicans who accused him of politicizing the office.\nMs. Lynch\u2019s reassurance that she will not overrule her investigators is significant. When the F.B.I. sought to bring felony charges against David H. Petraeus, the former C.I.A. director, for mishandling classified information and lying about it, Mr. Holder stepped in and reduced the charge to a misdemeanor. That decision opened a deep \u2014 and public \u2014 rift.\nTwo other political appointees will review the findings of the email investigation before a final decision is made: John P. Carlin, the assistant attorney general for national security, and Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates. But both have also pledged to follow the recommendations of the career prosecutors and the F.B.I., Ms. Newman said.\nThe F.B.I. is expected to make a recommendation to the Justice Department in the coming weeks, though agents have yet to interview Mrs. Clinton. While some legal experts said they believed that criminal indictments in the case were unlikely, the investigation continues to cast a shadow over Mrs. Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.\nBeyond the day-to-day workings of the Justice Department, there is precedent for relying on career officials to make politically charged decisions. When the Justice Department was considering whether to recommend sanctions against former Bush administration lawyers who approved waterboarding, Mr. Holder relied on his most senior career prosecutor to make the decision. No sanctions were recommended.\nFor Mrs. Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, the incident in Phoenix resurrected questions about how the campaign would rein in her irrepressible husband.\nWith approval ratings among Democrats of over 60 percent, Mr. Clinton is one of his wife\u2019s most potent surrogates. He has traversed the country with a breakneck schedule, campaigning and raising money for Mrs. Clinton, traveling with a bare-bones staff and security detail.\nMr. Clinton and his chief of staff, Tina Flournoy, are in frequent contact with John D. Podesta, chairman of the Clinton campaign, and Robby Mook, the campaign manager. He often listens in on campaign conference calls from the family\u2019s home in Chappaqua, N.Y. But his unpredictable and sociable nature can also cause problems for his wife\u2019s candidacy.\nDavid Axelrod, the former senior adviser to Mr. Obama, said on Twitter that he took Mr. Clinton and Ms. Lynch \u201cat their word\u201d that they had not discussed the investigation, but added that it was \u201cfoolish to create such optics.\u201d", "date": "July 1, 2016", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/02/us/politics/loretta-lynch-hillary-clinton-email-server.html", "tags": "f.b.i accept lynch loretta clinton inquiry recommendations former email \u201d meeting ms. campaign"}
