{"title": "Trump, at Putin\u2019s Side, Questions U.S. Intelligence on 2016 Election", "content": "HELSINKI, Finland \u2014 President Trump stood next to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Monday and publicly challenged the conclusion of his own intelligence agencies that Moscow interfered in the 2016 presidential election, wrapping up what he called a \u201cdeeply productive\u201d summit meeting with an extraordinary show of trust for a leader accused of attacking American democracy.\nIn a remarkable news conference, Mr. Trump did not name a single action for which Mr. Putin should be held accountable. Instead, he saved his sharpest criticism for the United States and the special counsel investigation into the election interference, calling it a \u201cridiculous\u201d probe and a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d that has kept the two countries apart.\nMr. Trump even questioned the determinations by his intelligence officials that Russia had meddled in the election.\n[Julie Hirschfeld Davis joined \u201cThe Daily\u201d to discuss how President Trump avoided criticizing President Vladimir V. Putin, and instead aimed his barbs at the U.S. Listen here.]\n\u201cThey said they think it\u2019s Russia,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI have President Putin; he just said it\u2019s not Russia,\u201d the president continued, only moments after Mr. Putin conceded that he had wanted Mr. Trump to win the election because of his promises of warmer relations with Moscow.\n\u201cI will say this: I don\u2019t see any reason why it would be\u201d Russia that was responsible for the election hacking, Mr. Trump added. \u201cPresident Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today.\u201d\nThe 45-minute news conference offered the spectacle of the American and Russian presidents both pushing back on the notion of Moscow\u2019s election interference, with Mr. Putin demanding evidence of something he said had never been proved, and Mr. Trump appearing to agree.\nWhen asked directly whether he believed Mr. Putin or his own intelligence agencies about the election meddling, Mr. Trump said there were \u201ctwo thoughts\u201d on the matter: one from American officials like Dan Coats, his director of national intelligence, asserting Russia\u2019s involvement; and one from Mr. Putin dismissing it.\n\u201cI have confidence in both parties,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\nHe then changed the subject, demanding to know why the F.B.I. never examined the hacked computer servers of the Democratic National Committee, and asking about the fate of emails missing from the server of Hillary Clinton, his campaign rival.\n\u201cWhere are Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails?\u201d Mr. Trump said.\nHis performance drew howls of protests from Democrats and some Republicans, prompting John O. Brennan, who served as C.I.A. director under President Barack Obama, to suggest that the remarks warranted Mr. Trump\u2019s impeachment.\n\u201cDonald Trump\u2019s press conference performance in Helsinki rises to & exceeds the threshold of \u2018high crimes & misdemeanors,\u2019\u201d Mr. Brennan wrote on Twitter, calling the president\u2019s behavior \u201ctreasonous.\u201d \u201cNot only were Trump\u2019s comments imbecilic, he is wholly in the pocket of Putin.\u201d\nThe House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, released a statement saying, \u201cthere is no question that Russia interfered in our election and continues attempts to undermine democracy.\u201d\nAnd within hours, Mr. Coats issued his own strongly worded statement that contained an implicit rebuke of Mr. Trump.\n\u201cWe have been clear in our assessments of Russian meddling in the 2016 election and their ongoing, pervasive efforts to undermine our democracy,\u201d Mr. Coats said. \u201cWe will continue to provide unvarnished and objective intelligence in support of our national security.\u201d\nSome of Mr. Trump\u2019s own advisers privately said they were shocked by the president\u2019s performance, including his use of the phrase \u201cwitch hunt\u201d to describe the special counsel investigation while standing beside Mr. Putin.\nAboard Air Force One back to Washington, Mr. Trump\u2019s mood grew foul as the breadth of the critical reactions became clear, according to some people briefed on the flight. Aides steered clear of the front of the plane to avoid being tapped for a venting session with Mr. Trump.\nSome political allies worried that the encounter with Mr. Putin would linger over Republicans heading into the midterm elections this fall.\n\u201cPresident Trump must clarify his statements in Helsinki on our intelligence system and Putin,\u201d Newt Gingrich, the former Republican speaker of the House who has advised Mr. Trump, said on Twitter. \u201cIt is the most serious mistake of his presidency and must be corrected \u2014 immediately.\u201d\nBoth presidents said it was vital to talk to each other because, as leaders of two major nuclear powers, they had a responsibility to engage in dialogue and ensure global stability.\nBut Mr. Trump\u2019s statements at the news conference were a remarkable break with his administration, which on Friday indicted 12 Russian intelligence officers for cyberattacks intended to interfere in the presidential contest. The indictment explained, in detail, how Russian intelligence officers hacked the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton presidential campaign, providing the most explicit account to date of the Russian government\u2019s meddling in American democracy.\nMr. Trump said he did not regard Mr. Putin as an adversary, but as a \u201cgood competitor,\u201d adding that, \u201cthe word competitor is a compliment.\u201d\nWhen Mr. Putin was asked by an American reporter whether he had wanted Mr. Trump to win and directed an effort intended to bring about that result, the Russian president quickly answered, \u201cYes I did, yes I did, because he talked about bringing the U.S.-Russia relationship back to normal.\u201d It was not clear whether he had heard the translation of the second part of the question.\nMr. Putin said he would look into the possibility of having Russian law enforcement authorities assist Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Moscow\u2019s election interference, in questioning the 12 people who were charged. Mr. Trump called it an \u201cincredible offer.\u201d\nBut in return, Mr. Putin, who rolled his eyes and snickered at the notion that he had compromising material on Mr. Trump or his family, said that Russia would expect American assistance in cases of interest to Moscow, including the ability to send Russian law enforcement officials to work in the United States.\nHe singled out William F. Browder, a longstanding critic of the Kremlin whose associates Mr. Putin accused of evading taxes and funneling millions of dollars to the Clinton campaign, without providing evidence.\nMr. Putin also took solace in Mr. Trump\u2019s doubt-casting about who was responsible for the hacking, saying the allegations that Russia had directed the effort were \u201cutter nonsense, just like the president recently mentioned.\u201d\nEmerging from his one-on-one meeting with Mr. Putin, which was followed by a larger lunch meeting with advisers, Mr. Trump cited a litany of factors that he said had stood in the way of better relations between the United States and Russia. He blamed Democrats\u2019 bitterness over having lost an election that they should have won, and Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation.\nBut Mr. Trump claimed to have defused all of that tension in a matter of minutes.\n\u201cOur relationship has never been worse than it is now,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cHowever, that changed as of about four hours ago.\u201d\nMr. Trump began his day on Monday on Twitter, blaming American \u201cfoolishness and stupidity\u201d for years of escalating tension with Russia, as well as the \u201cRigged Witch Hunt.\u201d\nThe comment appeared to absolve Moscow of many irritants in the relationship with Russia, including the election hacking, the annexation of Crimea, Russian backing for rebels in Ukraine and for the Assad government in Syria, and Moscow\u2019s suspected use of a nerve agent to poison people in Britain.\nIn fact, Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry recirculated the comment, chiming in, \u201cWe agree.\u201d\nFor much of the news conference, Mr. Trump appeared to be far more focused on defending the legitimacy of his election victory than on determining who was behind the election hacking.\n\u201cThere was no collusion at all \u2014 everybody knows it,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThat was a clean campaign. I beat Hillary Clinton easily.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cWe ran a brilliant campaign, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m president.\u201d\nLater, in an interview with Fox News, Mr. Putin repeated his assertion that Russia had not interfered in the American presidential race. But then he suggested that the hacking itself should not be treated as such an explosive issue, because the emails taken from Democratic officials were accurate.\n\u201cThe information that I am aware of, there\u2019s nothing false about it,\u201d Mr. Putin said in the interview. \u201cEvery single grain of it is true. And the Democratic leadership admitted it.\u201d\nIn the United States, critics of Mr. Trump reacted angrily to his contention that Russia and the United States shared blame for their deteriorated relationship.\n\u201cThis is bizarre and flat-out wrong,\u201d said Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska. \u201cThe United States is not to blame. America wants a good relationship with the Russian people, but Vladimir Putin and his thugs are responsible for Soviet-style aggression. When the president plays these moral equivalence games, he gives Putin a propaganda win he desperately needs.\u201d\nMr. Ryan said, \u201cThere is no moral equivalence between the United States and Russia, which remains hostile to our most basic values and ideas.\u201d\nThe summit meeting capped a weeklong European trip in which Mr. Trump disparaged NATO allies, castigated Germany, criticized the British prime minister on her own soil and branded the European Union a \u201cfoe\u201d on trade \u2014 while he mused about his wish for warmer relations with Mr. Putin.\nMany in Mr. Trump\u2019s own government consider Mr. Putin a potentially dangerous adversary to be countered, not courted. On Friday, Mr. Coats said of Russian cyberattacks on the United States, \u201cthe warning lights are blinking red again.\u201d\nAs Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump emerged from a longer-than-expected set of talks, which included a 130-minute one-on-one session with no advisers present, they said they had made progress in forging the bond that both were seeking.\n\u201cWe had direct, open, deeply productive dialogue,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIt went very well.\u201d\nMr. Putin said the two were \u201cglad with the outcome of our first full-scale meeting,\u201d adding, \u201cI hope that we start to understand each other better, and I\u2019m grateful to Donald for it.\u201d\nFinland, the site of the meeting, shares a long border with Russia and has been the site of past diplomatic breakthroughs. But this round of talks did not appear to have produced any.\nThe two presidents said they would work together on nuclear arms control, although neither mentioned a concrete set of actions on forging a new treaty to replace the New Start Treaty, which is set to expire in 2021. They also did not address what American officials have said are Russian violations of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty.\nThe two also said they would work together to secure Israel\u2019s border with Syria, restoring a cease-fire in the Golan Heights, and cooperate to bring humanitarian relief to address the toll of the civil war that has raged in Syria for more than seven years.\nMr. Trump said he had directly confronted Mr. Putin on the election interference, calling it \u201ca message best delivered in person.\u201d But he pivoted almost immediately to criticism of Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation and a recitation of his success in the Electoral College, blaming the investigation \u2014 not Russia\u2019s actions \u2014 for the inability of two great nuclear powers to work together.\n\u201cI think that the probe is a disaster for our country,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI think it\u2019s kept us apart; it\u2019s kept us separated. There is no collusion at all.\u201d\nHe twice called Mr. Putin\u2019s proposal to potentially allow Russian officials to question the 12 indicted agents with American observers present \u201can incredible offer.\u201d\nPeter Carr, a spokesman for the special counsel, had no comment on the idea.", "date": "July 16, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/16/world/europe/trump-putin-election-intelligence.html", "tags": "intelligence election \u201c russian u.s. side trump questions russia putin"}
