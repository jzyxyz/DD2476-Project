{"title": "Americans Think There Are 54 Million Muslims In America- There Are Only 3 Million-", "content": "Americans and Europeans drastically overestimate their Muslim populations, a new international survey shows,\u00a0a misperception many say is driven by Islamophobia and growing anti-Muslim sentiment.\nAmericans think 17 out of every 100 people in the U.S. are Muslim, according to the survey from Ipsos Mori, a U.K. research company. But, according to the nonpartisan\u00a0Pew Research Center, Muslims account for only 1 out of every 100 people in the U.S.\u00a0\nThat works out to Americans thinking there are about 54 million Muslims in the U.S., when in fact the Muslim population is about 3 million.\u00a0\nThis wide disparity between public perception and reality is even more pronounced in Europe. The French, for example, think Muslims make up 31 percent of the French population, when only 7.5 percent of that country is Muslim.\nAmericans also projected that Muslims would make up nearly a quarter of the country by 2020, according to the survey. Pew Research projects that the Muslim population in the U.S.\u00a0will reach 1.1 percent by 2020.\nAgain, this disparity is more pronounced in Europe, with French people believing Muslims will make up 40 percent of the population in 2020, when research puts that percentage at just 8.3 percent.\u00a0\nBobby Duffy, the managing director of Ipsos Mori\u2019s Social Research Institute, said non-Muslim-majority countries likely overestimate their Muslim populations for two main reasons.\u00a0\nThe first reason, he said, is\u00a0the \u201csheer volume of discussion of that group [Muslims]\u201d by politicians and the media \u201cis much bigger than the proportion of population that they make up.\u201d\u00a0\nThe second reason, he said, is that \u201cthe tone of that discussion is negative or has a sense of threat.\n\u201cWe are pre-programmed evolutionarily to focus on negative information. Negative information is more urgent information. Negative discussions take up more of our mental space and lead us to overestimate things.\u201d\nAnd many Americans have come to view Muslims negatively. Nearly 40 percent\u00a0of Americans don\u2019t have a favorable view of Muslims, and 56 percent think Islam\u00a0isn\u2019t compatible with American values.\u00a0\nAnd while Americans think there are 54 million Muslims in the U.S.,\u00a0another poll shows over half of Americans\u00a0admit they don\u2019t know a single Muslim personally.\u00a0\nAli Asani, a professor of Islamic studies at Harvard University, says America\u2019s overestimation of its Muslim population is the result of the fears and lies spread about Muslims, mostly by a multimillion-dollar network of American anti-Muslim groups, sometimes referred to as the Islamophobia industry.\u00a0\nHe said influential organizations such as the Center for Security Policy \u2015 listed by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a hate group \u2015 have helped create\u00a0\u201cthe\u00a0perception of the Muslim as the \u2018other\u2019 in the U.S. and as a threat to the U.S.\u201d\u00a0\nAsani pointed to the introduction of paranoid and superfluous anti-Sharia bills in 31 state legislatures as evidence of the Islamophobia industry\u2019s reach. David Yerushalmi, general counsel for the Center for Security Policy, has been at the forefront of producing reports and helping to draft legislation against Sharia.\nSimilarly, President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet choices include several who have made anti-Islamic statements or who have ties to anti-Muslim groups like CSP, which earnestly believes\u00a0in a secret Muslim plot to replace the U.S. Constitution with Sharia, or Islamic law.\u00a0 \nMichael Flynn, tapped to be national security adviser, is on the board of ACT for America, described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as the largest grass-roots anti-Muslim group in the U.S. The CIA nominee, Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.), sponsored an ACT for America legislative briefing on Capitol Hill and has spoken at their conferences. And Trump himself has called for the profiling of Muslims, the surveillance of mosques and a ban on Muslims entering the U.S.\u00a0\nThe discourse, Asani said, has essentially become about \u201cMuslims taking over the country.\u201d\u00a0And for that to be plausible, he said, people have to imagine a much bigger Muslim population than the one that exists. \u00a0\nIbrahim Hooper, spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said that \u201cif you\u2019re promoting anti-Muslim bigotry and your theory is that a small percentage of the population is going to take over, it doesn\u2019t work very well.\u00a0You have to create the impression that there\u2019s a flood of Muslims taking over America.\u201d\u00a0\nPeter Gottschalk, a professor of religion at Wesleyan University and coauthor of the book \u201cIslamophobia: Making Muslims the Enemy,\u201d said the Ipsos Mori survey is also \u201clikely to be\u00a0reflective of a general anxiety among the majority white population of U.S. and European countries toward the increasing number of non-white \u2015 or people perceived to be non-white \u2015 coming into their country.\u201d\nGottschalk said resistance in the U.S. to accepting more Syrian refugees is largely because Syrians are still \u201cracially constructed as Arab, and Arab-ness is Muslim-ness,\u201d even though many Syrians are actually Christian.\u00a0\nAndrew Stroehlein, the European media director at Human Rights Watch, told The Huffington Post over Twitter that for years people have heard about an \u201cinvasion\u201d or a \u201cswarm\u201d when it comes to Muslims, assertions he characterized as \u201chype.\u201d\n\u201cPeople have been whipped up over and over again and again \u2015 and this is over years, decades even in some countries \u2015 that their concept of reality is completely divorced from the truth,\u00a0and in a way it\u2019s not even their fault really,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe juggernaut of media and unscrupulous politicians is just so pervasive it has created an alternate universe. And then the real numbers are shown \u2015 and we realize just how ugly and powerful this hateful propaganda has been.\u201d\nUltimately, Stroehlein said, \u201cthe [Ipsos Mori] poll is a clear indication that fear can sadly be more influential than fact.\u201d\nAnd dehumanizing a group of people like Muslims, he added, by referring to them as a swarm or a horde,\u00a0is\u00a0\u201coften a precursor to crimes being committed against them.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIf they are somehow less then human, then it becomes easier to commit abuses against them,\u201d he said.\u00a0\nThe Huffington Post is documenting the rising wave of anti-Muslim bigotry and violence in America.
