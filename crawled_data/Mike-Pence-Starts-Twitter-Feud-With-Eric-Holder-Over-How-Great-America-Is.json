{"title": "Mike Pence Starts Twitter Feud With Eric Holder Over How Great America Is", "content": "Vice President Mike Pence and former Attorney General Eric Holder are fighting on Twitter about how great America is.\nHolder lit the fuse for the feud on Wednesday when he told MSNBC\u2019s Ari Melber\u00a0that the historic \u201cnotion of greatness\u201d that President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d campaign slogan harks back to \u201cnever in fact really existed.\u201d\n\u201cWhen I hear these things about let\u2019s \u2018Make America Great Again,\u2019 I think to myself, exactly when did you think America was great?\u201d Holder asked in the clip above. \u201cIt certainly wasn\u2019t when people were enslaved. It certainly wasn\u2019t when women didn\u2019t have the right to vote. It certainly wasn\u2019t when the LGBT community was denied the rights to which it was entitled.\u201d\n\u201cYou know, America has done superb things, has done great things, and it has been a leader in a whole range of things, but we\u2019re always a work in process,\u201d he added. \u201cLooking back, \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 is inconsistent with who we are as Americans at our best where we look at the uncertain future, embrace it, and make it our own.\u201d\nPence fired back on Twitter Thursday. He repeated Holder\u2019s question back to him and posted four images which demonstrated American greatness:\nHolder responded to say \u201cAmerica IS great\u201d and \u201ccan-and must-be greater still\u201d and the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d slogan means \u201cYOU think America is not great now-and is backward looking.\u201d", "date": "\n03/29/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mike-pence-eric-holder-make-america-great-again_n_5c9dca38e4b0474c08cbdab6", "tags": "eric things think america make feud great twitter starts pence holder \u201d back certainly mike"}
