{"title": "Judge Aaron Persky Under Fire for Sentencing in Stanford Rape Case", "content": "A California judge harshly criticized for giving what many say is a too-lenient sentence to a former Stanford student convicted of sexual assault has been bombarded by threats of violence against him and his family, an official said on Tuesday.\nThe judge, Aaron Persky, 54, on Thursday sentenced the former student, Brock Allen Turner, 20, to six months in jail for three felony counts: intent to commit rape, sexual penetration with a foreign object of an intoxicated person and sexual penetration with a foreign object of an unconscious person.\nThreatening phone calls have flooded into the Santa Clara County Superior Court since then, said Gary Goodman, a supervising attorney for the county public defender\u2019s office.\n\u201cPeople have been calling the court and leaving messages, and if someone answers, they say, \u2018Tell your judge he can go to hell, and I hope his kids get raped and he rots in hell,\u2019 \u201d said Mr. Goodman, who has defended the judge. \u201cHe\u2019s getting threats over this, him and his family, from all over the country. Is that right?\u201d\nHere is what we know about the jurist.\n\u2022 A former corporate lawyer and former criminal prosecutor who was appointed to the Santa Clara County Superior Court by Gov. Gray Davis in 2003, according to the Santa Clara County Bar Association. The judge is up for election this year but is running unopposed.\n\u2022 A Stanford alumnus. A Phi Beta Kappa graduate of the university, he was the captain of the men\u2019s lacrosse team, according to a 2002 article in The Stanford Daily.\n\u2022 While campaigning for a judgeship in 2002, he wrote a biography for the League of Women Voters of California that championed his work as a prosecutor in cases involving violent sex crimes and hate crimes.\n\u201cI focus on the prosecution of sexually violent predators, working to keep the most dangerous sex offenders in custody in mental hospitals,\u201d he wrote. If elected, he said, his top priorities would be \u201chonesty and integrity\u201d and \u201cequal access to justice for all.\u201d (He lost the election and was later appointed to the bench.)\n\u2022 He said he served as a member of the executive committee of the Support Network for Battered Women and the Santa Clara County Network for a Hate-Free Community.\n\u2022 The judge handed down a six-month sentence and three years probation to Mr. Turner, a champion swimmer convicted in March of attacking the 23-year-old woman behind a Dumpster on campus in 2015. The victim, who was not a Stanford student, had attended a fraternity party. Two graduate students riding past the Kappa Alpha fraternity house witnessed the assault and intervened to stop it; one chased and tackled Mr. Turner when he fled.\n\u201cWe saw that she was not moving, while he was moving a lot,\u201d one of the students, Carl Frederik Arndt, told the Swedish news outlet Expressen on Tuesday. \u201cShe was unconscious the entire time,\u201d Mr. Arndt also told CBS News. \u201cThe guy ran away, and my friend Peter chased after him.\u201d\n\u2022 The case attracted national attention on Friday after BuzzFeed published a powerful 7,244-word courtroom statement by the victim, who detailed the horror of that night and asserted that male and class privilege had irrevocably marred the trial and the sentencing.\n\u201cWhen the policeman arrived and interviewed the evil Swede who tackled you, he was crying so hard he couldn\u2019t speak because of what he\u2019d seen,\u201d she wrote. She called the students who held her attacker until the police arrived her \u201cheroes.\u201d\nBut of Mr. Turner, she said: \u201cYou took away my worth, my privacy, my energy, my time, my intimacy, my confidence, my own voice, until today. The damage is done; no one can undo it.\u201d Her letter was also released by Santa Clara County.\n\u2022 The furor grew after Michele Dauber, a Stanford law professor and sociologist, tweeted a statement by the defendant\u2019s father complaining that his son\u2019s life had been ruined for \u201c20 minutes of action.\u201d\n\u2022 Judge Persky was also excoriated for his comments about the defendant. In citing factors he weighed in the sentencing, The Guardian reported, the judge said Mr. Turner had \u201cless moral culpability\u201d for his actions because he was intoxicated, and he had \u201cno significant record of prior criminal offenses.\u201d\nThe judge also appeared to suggest that the jail sentence might be an \u201cantidote\u201d to the anxiety the former student may have suffered from the intense media attention. He told the courtroom, according to reports: \u201cA prison sentence would have a severe impact on him. I think he will not be a danger to others.\u201d\nAnd seeming to accept the defendant\u2019s account (Mr. Turner said the victim consented), the judge said: \u201cI take him at his word that subjectively that\u2019s his version of his events. \u2026 I\u2019m not convinced that his lack of complete acquiescence to the verdict should count against him.\u201d\nBecause of his conviction, Mr. Turner must register as a sex offender. In his courtroom statement, obtained by The New York Times, he cited the university\u2019s \u201cparty culture\u201d and drinking as factors in the sexual assault.\n\u2022 Besides a flood of critical comments online against the judge, Professor Dauber, a friend of the victim\u2019s family, said that she was part of an organization seeking to recall him. She said because the judge had no opponent and will be \u201cautomatically re-elected\u201d in November, the recall campaign was the only way to remove him. (Judge Persky won his race in the California primary Tuesday.)\nShe said his ruling had made female college students unsafe and cited what she called the judge\u2019s misapplication of the law in taking Mr. Turner\u2019s age, academic achievement and alcohol consumption into consideration.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to declare that a high-achieving perpetrator is an unusual case, then you\u2019re saying to women on college campuses that they don\u2019t deserve the full protection of the law in the state of California,\u201d the professor said.\n\u2022 A Change.org petition backing the judge\u2019s removal had collected more than 400,000 signatures by Tuesday. In order to successfully remove the judge, the recall campaign said it would need the signatures of at least 20 percent of the votes cast in November in Santa Clara County.\n\u2022 On Tuesday, lawmakers weighed in: Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, who prosecuted sexual assault cases as a lawyer, said the sentence didn\u2019t appear to provide adequate punishment, according to The Hill. \u201cTypically, that would be considered an inappropriate sentence,\u201d she said. The office of Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, said that a \u201cshort sentence sends the wrong message.\u201d (The senators have lobbied fellow legislators to change how the military handles sexual assault cases.)\n\u2022 The Stanford Daily said the judge\u2019s decision had outraged campus groups. Students were being urged to join a demonstration during the traditional university graduation procession that kicks off commencement on Sunday.\n\u2022 The Santa Clara County district attorney, Jeff Rosen, whose office tried the Stanford rape case, said in a statement on Monday, \u201cWhile I strongly disagree with the sentence that Judge Persky issued in the Brock Turner case, I do not believe he should be removed from his judgeship.\u201d\n\u2022 Molly O\u2019Neal, the Santa Clara County public defender, said she was \u201calarmed by the hysteria\u201d surrounding Mr. Turner\u2019s sentence. \u201cThe judge is required under California law to consider certain mitigating and aggravating factors,\u201d she said, including past criminal records and the presence of alcohol. \u201cWe need to be very careful we\u2019re not hanging judges out to dry based on one decision, especially because he is considered to be a fair and even-tempered judge,\u201d she said.\n\u2022 Mr. Goodman, the deputy public defender, said he had worked with the judge for three decades and denounced the proposed recall. He said Judge Persky was \u201can exceptional jurist\u201d who had accurately followed the relevant rules and statutes and formulated the sentence in consultation with the probation department.\n\u201cYou have to judge a case on its merits only,\u201d Mr. Goodman said. \u201cThe narrative on social media is \u2018We have to judge this case as part of the larger social issue of campus sexual abuse,\u2019 but as a judge, he is not allowed to do that.\u201d\nHe rejected the argument that race or social class had played any role in Mr. Turner\u2019s sentence. \u201cPeople say it\u2019s because he\u2019s a Stanford kid and he\u2019s rich and the judge played lacrosse. No, it\u2019s not done that way. It can\u2019t be done that way,\u201d Mr. Goodman added. \u201cIt would have been the exact same result for a person of color.\u201d", "date": "June 7, 2016", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/08/us/judge-in-stanford-rape-case-is-being-threatened-who-is-aaron-persky.html", "tags": "sentencing fire rape stanford sentence \u2022 county aaron judge \u201d turner case persky"}
