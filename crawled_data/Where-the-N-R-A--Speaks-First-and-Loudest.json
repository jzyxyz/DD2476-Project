{"title": "Where the N.R.A. Speaks First and Loudest", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Whenever there is a mass shooting, the National Rifle Association has a well-rehearsed response: Say very little until the inevitable discussion about gun control cools down. \nBut as the leaders of the country\u2019s most influential gun advocacy group kept quiet after the school shooting last week in Parkland, Fla., that claimed 17 lives, a furious debate played out on NRATV, the organization\u2019s online video channel. \nIts hosts spoke chillingly of leftist plots to confiscate weapons, media conspiracies to brainwash Americans into supporting gun control and a \u201cdeep state\u201d campaign to undermine President Trump.\n\u201cCoastal, socialist media elites hate guns so much,\u201d said one of the hosts, Grant Stinchfield, a Second Amendment activist based in Dallas and a radio commentator, that they would take everyone\u2019s away, \u201cleaving only criminals, of course, with the firepower \u2014 and all of us at the mercy of evil.\u201d\nCritics of the N.R.A. say that they have observed a shift in the organization\u2019s tone since Mr. Trump was elected that is much more pugilistic, and that NRATV is where the most outrageous commentary occurs. This change, they say, seems to reflect the fact that like many organizations on the right, the N.R.A. believes it has to guard against complacency among its members with a friendly president in the White House.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no boogeyman in the White House now to make people afraid of,\u201d said Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action, a gun control advocacy group. \u201cSo they have to make us afraid of one another, and that is how they will market guns in an age when they have a president beholden to them.\u201d \nThe channel has become a little-noticed but vital forum for the dissemination of some of the most strident pro-gun messaging in politics today, with hosts and guests who are closely allied with Mr. Trump. Few news media operations seem as in sync with the political sensibilities of the Trump era. \nThey attack the enemies he attacks, condemning the news media as \u201cdishonest\u201d and \u201cfailing.\u201d They have questioned the credibility of the F.BI., whose failure to act on tips about the suspect in the Florida shooting has intensified criticism from conservatives seeking to discredit the bureau \u2014 this week, Dana Loesch, an N.R.A. spokeswoman, encouraged mass demonstrations outside F.B.I. offices.\nAnd they often side with Mr. Trump in divisive cultural disputes \u2014 some of which have potent racial undercurrents \u2014 like his feuding with Black Lives Matter activists and the professional football players who knelt during the national anthem.\nWith broadcast television-quality production and three dozen original series, NRATV has the ability to reach millions of people through the channels that distribute it like Apple TV, Roku and Amazon Fire TV.  And it has significant resources at its disposal as part of the N.R.A.\u2019s far-reaching \u201cmembership support\u201d program. In recent years, that operation alone spent $35.5 million, according to its most recent publicly available tax filing.\nBut it is just the newest piece of a larger news media operation inside the N.R.A. that receives little attention compared with the group\u2019s political and lobbying activity. The organization produces at least seven print and online magazines that have a combined circulation of more than 11 million, according to the N.R.A. Its biggest social media channels on Facebook and Twitter count about 8.7 million followers. On YouTube, five N.R.A.-controlled channels have shared videos that have received nearly 102 million views. \nAndrew Arulanandam, a spokesman for the N.R.A., declined to discuss the media effort, the size of its online audience or its programming in the wake of the Parkland shooting. As a matter of policy, he said, the N.R.A. does not discuss proprietary matters. \nNRATV is a budding business for the organization, which has brokered sponsorship arrangements with gun makers like Kimber, Mossberg and Ruger to feature their firearms on its programs. Its series cover a range of topics and interests intended to appeal to gun owners of all kinds, like \u201cArmed and Fabulous,\u201d which profiles rifle-slinging women; \u201cFrontlines,\u201d a newsmagazine hosted by Oliver North; and \u201cUnder Wild Skies,\u201d which follows hunters in  pursuit of big-game trophies. \nBut politics and provocation are NRATV\u2019s specialty. It has singled out news outlets and attacked individual journalists like Don Lemon of CNN, who was targeted in an ad that accused the anchor and his network of smearing Mr. Trump and colluding with Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign. In one video released this month, Ms. Loesch, a former Tea Party activist and Breitbart editor, pretended she was about to burn a copy of The New York Times.\nStories that circulate throughout right-wing news media often find their way to NRATV, which has devoted numerous segments to portraying anti-Trump demonstrators as paid shills, violent extremists and evangelists for Shariah law in the United States.\nIts guests and hosts are not shy of trading in racially charged language and imagery. A promo for a program called \u201cNoir\u201d featuring a Navy SEAL member named Dom Raso opens with a dramatization of a foiled robbery. A black man wielding a knife grabs and forces a white woman to the ground as an armed bystander reaches for his handgun and rushes to her defense.      \nAfter Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration last year, an NRATV correspondent, Chuck Holton, tweeted that it was time to \u201cget busy scrubbing Obama\u2019s mocacchino stain off of America!\u201d \u2014 an apparent reference to the color of President Barack Obama\u2019s skin.\nThe N.R.A.\u2019s practice is to keep a low profile after mass shootings, as it did after the massacres in Newtown, Conn., and at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla. But it was always quietly talking to its members, first by email and later on NRATV, said Danny Barefoot, a partner at Anvil Strategies, an ad agency and communications company that has worked with gun control groups. \n\u201cIn those moments, the goal isn\u2019t to disseminate mass information and persuade a lot of people, \u201d Mr. Barefoot said. \u201cThe strategy is to be a messenger to the N.R.A.\u2019s own people.\u201d \nEli Pariser, the co-founder of Upworthy, a site that delivered progressive political videos to targeted audiences on Facebook, said that while videos produced by NRATV after a shooting might not go viral, they helped viewers \u201cfeel they\u2019re part of a community, led by a news source that speaks to them.\u201d\nNRATV can galvanize members in the wake of a shooting in part because the N.R.A. has coached its followers to believe that the organization is the only credible source for news and information on any gun issue or controversy. \nNRATV\u2019s slogan \u2014 \u201cAmerica\u2019s Most Patriotic Team on a Mission to Take Back The Truth\u201d \u2014 reinforces a sense of mistrust in traditional news media,  as do its hosts. In the days after the Parkland shooting, Mr. Stinchfield and Ms. Loesch, two of the channel\u2019s most prominent faces, were relentless in their attacks on the news media.\n\u201cIf it can topple us, it gets a direct path to the Second Amendment,\u201d Mr. Stinchfield told viewers this week from the organization\u2019s studio in Dallas. \u201cThey will stop at nothing to put us out of business.\u201d\nSome of his more recent antics have included taking a sledgehammer to a television set as clips from MSNBC, CNN and ABC play onscreen, and inviting North Korea to launch a nuclear weapon on Sacramento, where the California state legislature has approved numerous gun control measures opposed by the N.R.A.\nMr. Stinchfield went on to question the competence and motivation of the F.B.I. \u201cIt is time the F.B.I. got back to the business of keeping Americans safe, instead of being so focused on political vendettas,\u201d he said. He then turned the microphone over to Mr. Holton, who saw a slippery slope in new gun regulations and identified a new culprit in the proliferation of school shootings: the news media.\n\u201cPeople could just as easily call for restrictions on the first amendment,\u201d Mr. Holton said. \u201cThey could say, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s make it illegal to report on those school shootings because we all know, I mean, there\u2019s no doubt that the media circus that takes place every time one of these things happens causes more school shootings.\u201d ", "date": "Feb. 21, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/21/us/politics/nratv-nra-news-media-operation.html", "tags": "loudest first media news nratv speaks \u201d n.r.a gun \u2014"}
