{"title": "Royal Engagement Seen as Symbol of Change, With Asterisks", "content": "LONDON \u2014 For many in the British news media, the engagement of Prince Harry to Meghan Markle, a divorced biracial American, reflected how egalitarian Britain had become.\n\u201cA divorced, mixed-race, Hollywood actress who attended a Roman Catholic school is to marry the son of the next king,\u201d began the lead editorial on Tuesday in The Daily Telegraph, a conservative newspaper. \u201cSuch a sentence could simply not have been written a generation ago.\u201d\nIt was a sentiment \u2014 with some notable cautions \u2014 that echoed across political and ethnic boundaries.\nAfua Hirsch, the author of \u201cBrit(ish),\u201d a coming book about racial identity in Britain, said that as a mixed-race child she had found it hard to reconcile her British-ness with \u201cthe family at the apex of society,\u201d the racially homogeneous relatives of Prince Harry.\n\u201cThat feels like that\u2019s really changed,\u201d Ms. Hirsch said on Tuesday. \u201cThere\u2019s someone I can relate to now.\u201d\nBut for Ms. Hirsch and other chroniclers of racial inequality in Britain, it is problematic to frame Ms. Markle\u2019s engagement as too seminal a moment. The symbolism of Ms. Markle\u2019s entry into a family that once shunned commoners, Catholics and divorced people \u2014 let alone nonwhites \u2014 does little to diminish structural racism across Britain, several commentators said.\n\u201cMarkle is not Britain\u2019s Obama moment and shouldn\u2019t be covered as such,\u201d tweeted Reni Eddo-Lodge, the author of \u201cWhy I\u2019m No Longer Talking to White People About Race,\u201d a new book about institutional racism in Britain.\nOn Tuesday, it was announced that Ms. Markle would \u2014 in addition to joining the Anglican Church \u2014 apply for British citizenship after marrying Prince Harry on an unspecified date in May in St. George\u2019s Chapel at Windsor Castle, the site of many royal weddings.\nIn response,  a columnist for The Independent highlighted how Ms. Markle would find it far easier to gain citizenship through her husband, compared with the process other nonwhite immigrants face. Such immigrants are disproportionately more likely to fail the admission criteria than their white counterparts.\nAcross British society, the average black graduate earns nearly a quarter less than the average white worker, according to 2016 research compiled by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, an independent watchdog founded by the British government. The black unemployment rate is around twice as high as the white equivalent. Black people are significantly less likely to attend a top university, or reach a managerial position, than whites.\nBlack Britons are also disproportionately more likely to be in prison than African-Americans, whose incarceration rates are themselves disproportionately high, according to a parliamentary report published in September by a team led by David Lammy, a British lawmaker.\nMs. Markle\u2019s engagement \u201cis a wonderful moment for modern Britain, and it is especially poignant for Britain\u2019s ethnic minority communities,\u201d Mr. Lammy said, because it \u201csends a very powerful message about what it means to be black and British in 2017.\u201d\nBut citing Britain\u2019s gaping inequalities, he added, \u201cWe should never confuse powerful symbolism with the systemic action still necessary to address persistent discrimination and inequality.\u201d\nAnd against the background of Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union, a referendum that led to a rise in racial hate crime, others found even less reason to cheer the royal engagement.\n\u201cBrexit Britain is a deeply and increasingly xenophobic and racist society,\u201d said Priyamvada Gopal, a lecturer on post-colonial literature at the University of Cambridge, who had personally suffered a recent instance of racial abuse.\n\u201cWe know that to be black in Britain is to be seriously disadvantaged in relation to educational and employment opportunities,\u201d she said in an email.\n\u201cBritain\u2019s major universities and media houses are overwhelmingly white,\u201d she continued. \u201cStudents have been agitating in recent months to have their curriculum acknowledge Britain\u2019s imperial past, something the country has signally failed to do except through dishonest celebrations of imperial legacies.\u201d\nShe added, \u201cHow exactly will the marriage of a privileged young woman of color to a British prince address any of this?\u201d\nMany black Britons are happy about the engagement, said Charlie Brinkhurst-Cuff, deputy editor of Gal-Dem, a website that publishes women of color exclusively.\nBut Ms. Brinkhurst-Cuff also expressed wariness about exaggerating the engagement\u2019s significance, partly because mixed-race people like Ms. Markle are often already considered \u201cacceptable,\u201d Ms. Brinkhurst-Cuff said in an interview with the BBC. \u201cWe\u2019re sort of fetishized by the elite.\u201d\nShe added that if Ms. Markle \u201cwas darker skinned, it would be very unlikely that she would be marrying Prince Harry.\u201d\nThe plans by Ms. Markle, 36, to take up British citizenship and be baptized as an Anglican in the Church of England underscores how the royal union has shattered precedents.\nMs. Markle will be the first American to marry into the royal family since Wallis Simpson, the divorced socialite whose relationship with King Edward VIII triggered a constitutional crisis and prompted his abdication in 1936. The couple wed in 1937.\nAnd it was only in 2013 that the law was amended so that members of the royal family could marry Catholics without losing their place in the line of succession. Ms. Markle, a Protestant, was not baptized as a child. She attended a Catholic girls\u2019 school in her native Los Angeles.\nIt is unclear whether Ms. Markle will renounce her American citizenship.\nIn the United States, the oath administered to naturalized citizens requires that they \u201centirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state or sovereignty.\u201d\nFederal law does not state what happens if a native-born American \u2014 like Ms. Markle \u2014 marries a foreign prince.", "date": "Nov. 28, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/28/world/europe/uk-royal-wedding-harry-meghan-markle.html", "tags": "engagement markle royal \u201d britain asterisks change british prince seen black ms. symbol \u2014"}
