This of course is to accept the premise that there is such a thing as a prose style common to Irish writers, which there is not. George Moore and Francis Stuart, for example, may as well have written with the blunt end of a burnt stick, their styles \u2014 or un-styles \u2014 utterly lacking in melody. And many younger writers today ignore altogether the aspiration of language to the condition of music, in favor of direct engagement with a rocky reality rockily expressed; for them, the days of the bard are done with, and good riddance.\nAll the same, it can be argued, and frequently is, that the work of our greatest Irish writers in English, in what we shall dare to call the classical period, from Jonathan Swift in the 18th century to Samuel Beckett in the 20th, is marked by a grave musicality that is immediately identifiable, and as such celebrated or deplored. Indeed, so keenly alive was Beckett to the danger of being swept away on the wings of song that he fled from English into French, pour \u00e9crire sans style \u2014 to write without that sensuous stylistic note that attempts willy-nilly to soar above the commonplace noise of the world, and blend instead with the music of the spheres.\nThe proudest songster of them all was James Joyce. For a time in his young days he considered a career as a professional singer, and throughout his life was ever ready to \u201cgive us a song,\u201d in what is said to have been a fine light tenor, of which he was justifiably proud. And music is everywhere in his work, sometimes in the titles themselves (\u201cFinnegans Wake\u201d takes its name from a 19th-century ballad, while \u201cChamber Music\u201d makes at once a lofty claim and an indelicate pun), but always in its prose style. Any perceived difficulties in his books could be resolved, so he claimed, by reading them aloud; if you could hear the rhythm you were more than halfway to the sense.\nIn his lifetime, Joyce made two recordings of passages from his own work in his own voice. The first, in 1924, was a Shavian performance, all roly-poly vowels and rattling r\u2019s, of a speech from the Aeolus chapter of \u201cUlysses\u201d; this 78-r.p.m. phonograph record he is said to have considered not a success. In 1929, for the Orthological Institute in Cambridge, he read, or better say lilted, the closing pages of the \u201cAnna Livia Plurabelle\u201d section of \u201cFinnegans Wake.\u201d It is a rendition at once playful, beautiful and moving, despite the curious stage-Irish, West-of-Ireland accent he adopts for the occasion. (That was probably in imitation, or parody, of his wife, the Galway girl Nora Barnacle \u2014 Joyce\u2019s father is said to have observed on hearing the name that certainly she would never leave him.)\nThe pages that constitute \u201cAnna Livia Plurabelle\u201d are surely the most easily decipherable in that masterly and monstrous ragbag of a book. Curiously, they contain a distinct echo of the opening of a work he had published a quarter of a century before \u201cWake,\u201d namely 1916\u2019s \u201cA Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.\u201d That novel opens with a fragment of a song: \u201cO, the wild rose blossoms / On the little green place\u201d; a dance tune, \u201cTralala lala, / Tralala tralaladdy\u201d; and a cautionary rhyme recited by the infant Stephen Dedalus\u2019s frightful governess, appropriately nicknamed Dante, \u201cPull out his eyes, / Apologise, / Apologise, / Pull out his eyes.\u201d\nHere is ample opportunity for melodic rendition by a reader-aloud. It is an opportunity Colin Farrell, the latest in a long line of actors to record audiobooks of \u201cA Portrait,\u201d nonchalantly rejects. Listeners familiar with other spoken versions, for instance the splendid 1995 Naxos performance by Jim Norton \u2014 and it is a performance \u2014 will surely be startled, at least in the beginning, by Farrell\u2019s straightforward, matter-of-fact presentation. However, having worked past startlement, not to say consternation, most will acknowledge the peculiar aptness of Farrell\u2019s approach.\nJoyceans are starkly divided in their interpretations of \u201cA Portrait.\u201d Some have regarded it as a masterpiece of sustained irony. Joyce frequently remarked that readers tended to miss the fact, announced in the book\u2019s title, that this is a portrait of the artist as a young man, and therefore the exalted, epiphanic tone is to be taken with a large handful of salt, as both a celebration and an undermining of youthful artistic extravagance. Other critics have held that Joyce was deadly serious in this autobiographical fiction, and that the airlessness of the style is an ineradicable artistic misjudgment.\nFarrell finds his way between Scylla and Charybdis by the simple expedient of not looking to the right or left, but sailing straight on regardless. His is not a beautiful voice, per se, as Norton\u2019s is, or as Andrew Scott\u2019s was in a recent BBC radio adaptation of \u201cA Portrait.\u201d Indeed, one cannot help thinking that Farrell presents the text rather as Cranly, Stephen\u2019s common-sensical friend, might have done: with a scrupulous yet not unskeptical lack of emphasis.\nIn Farrell\u2019s reading, then, the great set pieces of the book \u2014 the violently argumentative Christmas dinner scene, the harrowing sermon on hell and especially the swooning descriptions of Stephen\u2019s encounters with the whores of Dublin\u2019s Nighttown \u2014 are delivered with admirable coolness and restraint. This, surely, is how Joyce, a little shamefaced at the stylistic and, in places, emotional excesses of this great early work, would have wanted to hear it done \u2014 spoken, not sung.", "date": "May 14, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/books/review/james-joyce-portrait-of-the-artist-as-a-young-man-colin-farrell.html", "tags": "league \u2018 joyce narrators style work young joins artist high-profile \u201d music portrait colin farrell \u2014"}
