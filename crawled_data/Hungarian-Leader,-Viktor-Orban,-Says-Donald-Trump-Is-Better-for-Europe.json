Trump make him the better option for Europe and for Hungary, said Viktor Orban, the Hungarian prime minister, on Saturday.\nMr. Orban, who has ordered border fences built to stop migrants, said that the ideas of the \u201cupstanding American presidential candidate\u201d about the need for the best intelligence services and his opposition to \u201cdemocracy export\u201d were also applicable in Europe.\n\u201cI am not Donald Trump\u2019s campaigner,\u201d Mr. Orban said at an event in Baile Tusnad, Romania, an area with a large Hungarian population. He said he had listened to Mr. Trump\u2019s proposals to stop terrorism, and \u201cI myself could not have drawn up better what Europe needs.\u201d\nMr. Orban, who returned to power in 2010, has often been criticized by the European Union, the United States and others for his efforts to centralize power, control civic groups and increase his influence over the media.\nIn 2011, while she was secretary of state, Hillary Clinton visited Hungary, and expressed the United States\u2019 concerns about government corruption there and the independence of Hungary\u2019s courts and its press.\nMr. Orban, whose speech was broadcast on Hungarian state media, blamed the West for what he saw as failed interventions in countries such as Egypt and Libya. He added that Hungary was not \u201cindifferent\u201d to political and human rights in Turkey, but that its stability was most important.\n\u201cIf I\u2019m asked what is Hungary\u2019s strongest expectation regarding Turkey today, we will put stability first,\u201d Mr. Orban said. \u201cIf Turkey becomes unstable, many tens of millions of people from that region will hurtle toward Europe without any sort of filtering, screening or control.\u201d\nMr. Orban was critical of the European Union\u2019s leadership in Brussels, and said that individual countries in Europe should have more authority to make its own decisions on specific issues, such as migration.\n\u201cWe have to make it clear that our problem is not in Mecca, but in Brussels,\u201d Mr. Orban said. \u201cThe bureaucrats in Brussels are an obstacle for us, not Islam.\u201d", "date": "July 23, 2016", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/24/world/americas/hungarys-viktor-orban-says-donald-trump-is-better-for-europe.html", "tags": "better hungary make orban \u201d trump europe donald says hungarian leader viktor said"}
