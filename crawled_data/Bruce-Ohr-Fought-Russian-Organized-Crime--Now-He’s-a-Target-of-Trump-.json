{"title": "Bruce Ohr Fought Russian Organized Crime. Now He\u2019s a Target of Trump.", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 When a lawyer for one of Russia\u2019s most powerful reputed crime bosses arrived at F.B.I. headquarters one day around 2006, he wanted to cut a deal. The Russian, Semion Y. Mogilevich, had been indicted three years earlier by the department on charges of defrauding a company outside Philadelphia out of $150 million and could not travel for fear of arrest.\nAs the lawyer made his pitch, a supervising F.B.I. agent and a senior career Justice Department official, Bruce G. Ohr, both listened intently, according to a former bureau official who described the meeting. The case was significant for American law enforcement. It had made headlines and laid the groundwork for Justice Department efforts to combat Russian organized crime overseas.\nFinally, the F.B.I. agent spoke. No deal, he said; Mr. Mogilevich must surrender. Mr. Ohr said little, but his unwillingness to negotiate was signal enough: The Justice Department would not compromise with the Russian mafia.\n\u201cOccasionally you run across people from the Justice Department who have an air of superiority toward agents, and Bruce had none of that,\u201d said Chris Swecker, a former senior F.B.I. official who worked with Mr. Ohr. \u201cHe was just the opposite. He was well liked at the F.B.I. and fought for their cases.\u201d\nIn nearly three decades at the Justice Department, Mr. Ohr has made a career of supporting and facilitating important cases that targeted Russian organized crime. Now he is a target of President Trump, who has put his security clearance under review and attacked him publicly, and allies. They have cast Mr. Ohr and his wife \u2014 who worked as a contractor at the same research firm that produced a damaging dossier of information about Mr. Trump \u2014 as villains, part of a pro-Clinton cabal out to destroy the president.\nBut Mr. Ohr, 56, is far from corrupt, friends and former colleagues said. An experienced law enforcement official, he has a deep understanding of the underworld of Russian organized crime, they said, including raising concerns about at least one oligarch whose name has resurfaced amid the scrutiny of contacts between Trump associates and Russia.\nAs part of this work, Mr. Ohr met a British spy who specialized in Russia, Christopher Steele, and the two men developed a bond based on their shared expertise. Mr. Steele went on to investigate ties between Mr. Trump and Russia for the same research firm, Fusion GPS, where Ms. Ohr was a contractor.\nThose connections have upended Mr. Ohr\u2019s once relatively anonymous life, dragging him into the maelstrom of the Russia investigation. Justice Department officials transferred Mr. Ohr, an associate deputy attorney general, to a less powerful post last year after learning about his contacts with Mr. Steele and the scope of his wife\u2019s work. If he loses his security clearance, he would probably be forced to leave federal law enforcement after nearly three decades.\n\u201cFor him to be in the Justice Department, and to be doing what he did, that is a disgrace,\u201d Mr. Trump said of Mr. Ohr this month to reporters.\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Ohr is to appear before a closed hearing of the House Judiciary and House Oversight committees, jointly investigating F.B.I. and Justice Department activities related to the 2016 election. Republicans are likely to ask Mr. Ohr why he met with Mr. Steele even after the F.B.I. terminated its relationship with Mr. Steele for speaking to the news media and who approved the meetings.\nThose who know Mr. Ohr seem perplexed that the president has singled him out. Co-workers and former associates describe him as a scrupulous government official who cares deeply about the Justice Department.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a small player in a bigger, broader stage here,\u201d Mr. Swecker said. \u201cI feel bad for him. I think he is well intentioned. I view him as someone who would never do anything malicious.\u201d\nMr. Ohr\u2019s lawyer, Joshua Berman, declined to comment for this article.\nA graduate of Harvard Law School, Mr. Ohr joined the Justice Department in 1991 from a law firm in San Francisco. As a federal prosecutor in Manhattan, he twice won top awards and rose to be chief of the district\u2019s violent gangs unit.\nHe had a knack for managing people and pushing cases forward, former associates said, which helped propel him to a job at the Justice Department in Washington in 1999 as the head of the organized crime and racketeering section. He provided the F.B.I. with resources to prosecute cases and navigated relationships with the intelligence community, brokering disputes and earning the respect of the F.B.I. and prosecutors.\nAs oligarchs and gangs flourished in Eurasia after the fall of the Soviet Union, Mr. Ohr, his deputies, the F.B.I. and federal prosecutors tackled Russian crime syndicates, said J. Kenneth Lowrie, a former federal prosecutor who was Mr. Ohr\u2019s longtime deputy.\n\u201cUntil 9/11, organized crime was one of the main priority criminal programs at the Justice Department,\u201d said Mr. Lowrie, who retired in 2008. \u201cRussian organized crime was a focus. Bruce knew a lot of the Russia stuff and traveled there.\u201d\nMr. Ohr\u2019s section supported the 2000 prosecution of Pavlo Lazarenko, the former prime minister of Ukraine, who was convicted of money laundering, wire fraud and extortion in a case brought by the office of the United States attorney in San Francisco at the time, Robert S. Mueller III, who is now the special counsel.\nMr. Ohr was a manager, not a litigator, who built bridges with law enforcement agencies around the world, former Justice Department officials said. He sent top deputies to Hungary to root out the nascent Russian mob in the early 2000s. F.B.I. agents viewed the commitment as a sign of his seriousness about combating Russian organized crime.\nIn 2006, Mr. Ohr was part of a group of government officials who revoked the visa of Oleg Deripaska, a Russian billionaire and aluminum magnate. Officials were concerned that Mr. Deripaska might try to come to the United States to launder illicit profits through real estate, a former law enforcement official said.\nMr. Deripaska, a close ally of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, has been tied to the former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who was convicted last week of tax and bank fraud. In 2016, Mr. Manafort offered private campaign briefings to Mr. Deripaska, raising concerns about the prospect of Russians wielding influence inside the White House. In April, the United States imposed sanctions on Mr. Deripaska.\nIn 2007, Mr. Ohr met Mr. Steele, who was still with MI-6, the British spy service, according to a former senior American law enforcement official who knows both men. Both governments approved their contacts, the former official said.\nMr. Ohr moved on to other senior jobs, starting in 2010 as counsel for international relations in the Justice Department\u2019s transnational organized crime and international affairs section, where he bolstered partnerships with foreign law enforcement agencies. In 2014, he became the director of the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces, distributing grant money to bolster prosecutorial work.\nHe stayed in touch with Mr. Steele, meeting him in Rome in 2014 and in Washington in 2015.\nFor the F.B.I., their relationship would come in handy. A longtime informant who provided valuable tips on corruption, Mr. Steele violated his confidentiality agreement with the F.B.I. when he disclosed to a reporter in the months before the 2016 election that he had been working with the bureau. He had expressed frustration that his information about Mr. Trump, gathered for Fusion GPS, the research firm that hired him on behalf of Democrats to research the candidate, had gone seemingly nowhere in the F.B.I.\nIn early November 2016, the agent handling Mr. Steele told him not to obtain intelligence \u201con behalf of the F.B.I.\u201d\nThat did not stop F.B.I. agents from collecting coveted information from Mr. Steele. While the F.B.I. could no longer consider him a confidential informant, former officials said, agents eager to assess the dossier as part of their counterintelligence investigation into links between Trump associates and Russia\u2019s election interference could still document what he was telling a third party \u2014 Mr. Ohr.\nAnd when Mr. Ohr approached the F.B.I. about his relationship with Mr. Steele, bureau officials saw an opportunity.\nMr. Ohr met with Mr. Steele almost a dozen times beginning in late 2016 through May 2017, according to congressional officials. F.B.I. agents interviewed Mr. Ohr after the meetings and documented the information.\nRepublicans have seized on the meetings. Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and the head of the Senate Judiciary Committee, asked the Justice Department to declassify the F.B.I.\u2019s reports on them. \u201cIt seems like he is a key player,\u201d Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio and a staunch supporter of the president, told Fox News this month.\nBut the arrangement was not unusual, former law enforcement officials said. Senior F.B.I. officials were aware of the Steele meetings, and those involved followed internal guidelines, a former official said.\nMr. Ohr\u2019s contacts with Mr. Steele were one small part of a broader effort to determine whether the allegations in the dossier were true, a former official said. The F.B.I. also did not have all the reports that Mr. Steele had produced and agents were keen to get them.\nConservatives have also targeted Ms. Ohr, whose contract work at Fusion GPS involved monitoring Russian news media and compiling connections between Mr. Trump and Russia from public documents. She did not work on the dossier, according to a person familiar with her work for Fusion GPS.\nMr. Ohr still has a job at the Justice Department, though he is functionally no longer a manager. It is unclear how long that will last. Mr. Trump has called for Attorney General Jeff Sessions to fire Mr. Ohr.\n\u201cIt seems that Bruce had two sins: He met with Chris Steele and his wife worked for Fusion GPS. None of that seems wrong to me,\u201d Mr. Lowrie said. \u201cBruce is a straight arrow. He was totally nonpartisan, as we all were expected\u201d to be.", "date": "Aug. 27, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/27/us/politics/bruce-ohr-trump-justice-department.html", "tags": "fought organized ohr f.b.i steele russian department former justice trump crime target bruce"}
