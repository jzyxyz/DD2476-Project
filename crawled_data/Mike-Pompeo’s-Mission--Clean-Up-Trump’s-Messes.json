{"title": "Mike Pompeo\u2019s Mission: Clean Up Trump\u2019s Messes", "content": "One of the first problems that Mike Pompeo solved for Donald Trump was the President\u2019s Daily Brief. On every morning (or at least some of them), the president has traditionally received the most crucial findings of the United States spying apparatus, personally delivered in a solemn face-to-face exchange with a senior intelligence official. Beginning in late 2016, a series of anonymously sourced reports claimed that Trump was not taking the brief with sufficient frequency, or seriousness, or focus, or preparation. Even after the inauguration, there were claims that the spies did not trust him and were holding the good stuff back; there were claims that Trump did not even believe in objective reality. In the middle of it was Pompeo, Trump\u2019s new C.I.A. director, who some in the president\u2019s circle felt was the man best suited to educate Trump about the complexities of foreign policy. The president \u201chas a steep learning curve, but you\u2019ve got to get him up it quickly,\u201d Stephen K. Bannon, Trump\u2019s former senior adviser, says he told Pompeo.\nThe day after the inauguration, Bannon recalls, Pompeo showed Trump around his office in Langley, Va. Pompeo, he says, \u201ccan connect with this guy. You can tell the president is differently engaged with Pompeo than with anybody else.\u201d Pompeo learned to arrive at the White House with answers to the president\u2019s favorite questions: Why should we care? What\u2019s in it for us? Can anyone else do it? How much does it cost? By mid-2017, the gripes about the president\u2019s briefing habits grew milder. Now the focus had narrowed to Trump\u2019s dislike of written briefings. In early 2018, Pompeo appeared on a panel and made it sound as if everything was normal. As a listener, he said, Trump was \u201cat the same level\u201d as 25-year intelligence veterans: \u201cHe\u2019s using it. He\u2019s taking it on board.\u201d He even had examples in which Trump had drilled down into P.D.B. items on Yemen and Venezuela. Pompeo\u2019s interlocutor, the Washington Post columnist and former Bush administration speechwriter Marc Thiessen, seemed convinced. Two days later, he repeated Pompeo\u2019s claims, unchallenged, in The Post. The headline: \u201cRest Easy About Trump\u2019s Fitness.\u201d\nPompeo, one of the last remaining members of Trump\u2019s original White House team, is now secretary of state. As Trump tries to execute some hairpin policy turns, often by tweet, it is Pompeo who travels the world to clean up the wreckage. Gen. Michael Hayden, the former C.I.A. and National Security Agency head, likens him to Winston (the Wolf) Wolfe, Harvey Keitel\u2019s hard-nosed problem-solver in \u201cPulp Fiction.\u201d It\u2019s the Wolf who is dispatched by the crime boss Marsellus Wallace to deal with an unexpected dead body in the back of his enforcers\u2019 car. \u201cHe\u2019s got to clean up Kim Jong-un, because there wasn\u2019t a deal,\u201d Hayden said of Pompeo, referring to the vagueness of the promises that resulted from Trump\u2019s first meeting with the North Korean leader in June 2018. \u201cNow, he\u2019s got to clean up Mohammed bin Salman,\u201d the crown prince of Saudi Arabia accused of ordering the murder of a journalist \u2014 a situation with just as much complexity and far less upside.\nOne of Pompeo\u2019s most recent cleanup missions took him to the American University in Cairo, where, on Jan. 10, he delivered a speech titled \u201cA Force for Good: America Reinvigorated in the Middle East.\u201d The speech was supposed to be the centerpiece of a nine-country Middle East trip that Pompeo planned weeks in advance. Initially, he intended to focus his conversations with United States allies on Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and the possible formation of an \u201cArab NATO\u201d that would save the United States money while encircling Iran. But this had been complicated by a tweet from @realDonaldTrump proclaiming that \u201cWe have defeated ISIS in Syria.\u201d Later that day, the commander in chief filmed a video in front of the White House: \u201cOur boys, our young women, our men, they\u2019re all coming back. And they\u2019re coming back now.\u201d \nSo in addition to the usual hand-holding and deal-making of international diplomacy, Pompeo would be doing a lot of explaining to skittish allies. The previous day, he visited with United States troops and Iraqi ministers, flying from Amman to Baghdad to Erbil to Baghdad to Amman, and then to Cairo. Three days in, he was already hoarse; his voice at the lectern sounded like a tire rolling through wet gravel. He is a bearish man \u2014 the administration\u2019s backslapping offensive lineman, shorter and rounder than Trump. His face is appealing but not handsome, firm but not unkind. He often looks to be surveying some amber waves of grain; you could imagine his official photo gracing the wall of an Elks lodge or a Cadillac dealership. \u201cHe just loves the farm,\u201d Pompeo\u2019s wife, Susan, told me, describing his resemblance to the Kansans on his mother\u2019s side of the family. \u201cHardiness. Hard-working. Stoic. \u2018What do you mean you don\u2019t work past 5:01?\u2019\u2009\u201d\nThe Cairo speech was designed to serve as, among other things, the Trump administration\u2019s rebuttal to the \u201cNew Beginning\u201d speech that Obama gave in Cairo nearly a decade before, which itself had been an attempt to rebuke the mistakes of the Bush administration. The audience was smaller than Obama\u2019s \u2014 around 300 in the sterile suburbs of New Cairo, compared with the more than 1,000 who saw Obama at Cairo University in Giza. Pompeo\u2019s crowd was a friendly one, handpicked by the United States Embassy, and a few seats in the venue remained empty. As we waited for Pompeo to enter the room, I was warned, along with other members of the media who were present, not to stray from our assigned area to take part in the general mingling. The constraints were not surprising, given Trump\u2019s own attitude toward the media and his closeness with Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, Egypt\u2019s strongman ruler, who has jailed dozens of reporters and blocked hundreds of websites.\nThe speech that lay before Pompeo on the lectern was an energetic one, laying out a muscular vision of \u201cAmerican power\u201d as a \u201cliberating force.\u201d But Pompeo looked tired, and it wasn\u2019t hard to imagine that some of his weariness was existential. Trump\u2019s Syria announcement had been poorly received by many of his own senior staff members. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis resigned. Pompeo would now have to spend much of the trip trying to interpret Trump\u2019s intentions in public. He would have to walk a difficult tightrope, respecting Trump\u2019s instincts while channeling them into something coherent. If he failed, United States allies in the region might look elsewhere for protection. In recent months, the leaders of Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates all had meetings with Vladimir Putin.\nIn Cairo, Pompeo tried to spin the announced Syria withdrawal as a sign of renewed American commitment. He said the United States would \u201cuse diplomacy and work with our partners to expel every last Iranian boot.\u201d Expelling the last Iranian boot would more likely take years or decades, not the 120 days that was the Pentagon\u2019s interpretation of Trump\u2019s \u201ccoming back now.\u201d The genius of the \u201clast Iranian boot\u201d was that Pompeo\u2019s divergence from Trump lay below the surface; the promise of an extended United States presence was never made fully explicit.\nPompeo\u2019s rhetoric was at once revolutionary, claiming to be overturning the policies of the Obama years, and institutionalist, claiming to be rooted in some earlier tradition of American goodness. \u201cIt was here, here in this city, that another American stood before you,\u201d Pompeo said. Never citing Obama by name, he ran down a list of his errors: failing to connect terrorism with its ideological \u201cIslamist\u201d roots, denigrating America\u2019s post-9/11 conduct and suggesting that \u201ca new beginning\u201d was even necessary. (\u201cI don\u2019t think I ever went to their motivations,\u201d Pompeo told me later. \u201cIt was always about how they grabbed the wrong end of the stick.\u201d)\nIt has often fallen to Pompeo to take Trump\u2019s shifting foreign-policy instincts and weave them together into something legible, defensible and sometimes even coherent, all without angering a president who is reputed to interpret disagreement as a form of disloyalty. Trump\u2019s tweets, abrupt changes of mind and penchant for creating staff turmoil combine to make this a Sisyphean endeavor. And yet Pompeo has tenaciously kept on rolling this particular boulder. You can look at most every place where Trump has made a lasting impact on United States foreign policy and find Pompeo not far away: withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement and the Iran nuclear deal; imposing sanctions against the governments of Iran and Venezuela; offering kind words for autocrats in Turkey, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Pompeo is the primary architect of Trump\u2019s continuing negotiations over the nuclear arsenal controlled by North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un.\nIn the process, he seems to have retained Trump\u2019s loyalty, even as critics of the administration (including Hayden) credit him with having reined in the president\u2019s instinctive isolationism. \u201cHe\u2019s an internationalist,\u201d says Barbara Stephenson, a former ambassador to Panama, who leads a professional association for United States foreign-service officers. \u201cHe believes American global leadership is a good thing.\u201d But regardless of whether Pompeo\u2019s conduct in the Oval Office is that of a Trump enabler or a Trump whisperer, whether he is a member of Trump\u2019s war cabinet or the last adult in the room, his attempt to weld Trump\u2019s moves into a real doctrine will outlast the presidency that gave birth to it. Whoever winds up inheriting Trump\u2019s foreign-policy legacy will begin in the shadow of Mike Pompeo.\nSoon after Trump nominated him to lead the State Department, Pompeo arranged a call with each of his living predecessors to ask for their advice. Among them was Hillary Rodham Clinton. As a member of the House Select Committee on Benghazi, Pompeo had called her response to the 2012 attacks \u201cmorally reprehensible\u201d and said that it was \u201cworse, in some ways,\u201d than Watergate. During the 2016 campaign, he tweeted out news of hacked emails from Clinton\u2019s campaign with the word \u201cBUSTED.\u201d At the time, he cited as his source WikiLeaks, an organization he later, as C.I.A. director, called a \u201cnonstate hostile intelligence service.\u201d By the time of his call with her, Pompeo\u2019s take on Clinton seemed to have undergone a similarly dramatic reversal. \u201cI want to thank you for your noble service to our country,\u201d he said to her, according to a person familiar with their conversation.\n\u201cShe was most gracious,\u201d Pompeo said, quietly, when I asked him how he had managed to pick up the phone and make the call to a longtime adversary. \u201cI am all about moving forward.\u201d\nWe were sitting in Pompeo\u2019s office on the seventh floor of Main State, the blocky old Harry S. Truman Building in Foggy Bottom, Washington. The room was stuffed with Pompeo-related bric-a-brac \u2014 a poster from an oil-supply company Pompeo had led; a gumball machine honoring the Wichita State Shockers; a drawing executed by Pompeo himself, in crayon, at age 8. He was holding a binder-clipped sheaf of what looked to be eight or nine long notecards, with a handwritten list on top. Instead of taking a seat behind his desk, Pompeo had selected a more casual position at a side table opposite the window. He seemed to want to communicate to me that he was still fairly awe-struck by the place. \u201cYou see Lincoln,\u201d he said, as he showed me around the office. He pointed to the view of the monuments outside the window. \u201cIf you look all the way up, you can see the planes land. Up on the eighth floor, there\u2019s a balcony where we watch fireworks with all the ambassadors on the Fourth of July. And it\u2019s a chance to develop some good relationships.\u201d\n\u201cNo eternal allies and no permanent enemies,\u201d Henry Kissinger\u2019s gloss on realpolitik (borrowed from Lord Palmerston), could also describe Pompeo\u2019s approach to relationships. Former secretaries of state had told him that his success would depend on the strength of his White House ties. \u201cTo a person, they began by saying that the most valuable asset you have is your relationship with the president,\u201d he told me. It sounded like a brag, but he hadn\u2019t meant it that way, so he corrected himself. \u201cThe most valuable asset to a secretary of state is having a good working relationship with the president. They weren\u2019t referring necessarily to mine.\u201d\nWhen he arrived at the State Department in April, Pompeo had the good fortune to directly follow Rex Tillerson, who was widely seen by the career diplomatic corps as having been sent by the White House to restructure the department into oblivion. Tillerson instituted a hiring freeze while he undertook a lengthy \u201creorganization\u201d to root out \u201cinefficiencies.\u201d More than half the department\u2019s senior-level career diplomats resigned. Pompeo was able to generate almost instant good will by lifting the hiring freeze. He installed the diplomatic equivalent of a four-star general, the career ambassador Dan Smith, to lead the Foreign Service Institute, the department\u2019s in-house training academy. At some points during Tillerson\u2019s tenure, it wasn\u2019t clear who spoke for America. \u201cSave your energy, Rex, we\u2019ll do what has to be done!\u201d Trump tweeted, in the midst of Tillerson\u2019s discussions with North Korea. Tillerson, Trump complained, was \u201cwasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man.\u201d The public squabbling aggravated a longtime worry within State that their work simply didn\u2019t matter, having been eclipsed by the gigantic budget of the Pentagon and the superior White House access of the National Security Council. Under Obama, the job of secretary of state went to Hillary Clinton and then to John Kerry (Obama\u2019s second choice), two heavyweight politicians who nevertheless struggled at times to maintain their influence with the president\u2019s core team. Pompeo was the first secretary in many years who seemed to have a bond with the president comparable to Kissinger\u2019s with Nixon. Pompeo\u2019s pull with the White House gave the department a renewed sense of purpose, even among those who differed with Trump on policy.\n[Read Jason Zengerle\u2019s profile of Rex Tillerson when he was secretary of state.]\nDuring his first months in Foggy Bottom, Pompeo identified four priorities \u2014 Syria, Iran, North Korea and Afghanistan \u2014 and brought in four new special representatives to tackle them and report directly to him. \u201cI go in there with my arguments better prepared than I have at any time in my life,\u201d says Stephen E. Biegun, the special representative for North Korea, when describing Pompeo\u2019s management style. \u201cI feel like I coasted in my previous jobs.\u201d (As Venezuela became a concern, Elliott Abrams was brought on to address the crisis there. During the 1980s, Abrams was a staunch anti-Communist; at the State Department under President Reagan, he gave United States military assistance to Central American leaders who massacred tens of thousands of civilians. In 1991, Abrams pleaded guilty to withholding information from Congress about a secret effort to arm Nicaraguan guerrillas. Pompeo has praised his \u201cpassion for the rights and liberties of all peoples.\u201d)\nIn his major policy speeches, like the one in Cairo, Pompeo has situated Trump somewhere between the neoconservative militarism of Paul Wolfowitz and the isolationism of Rand Paul. In so doing, he has helped to coalesce what might be called a frugal-hawk foreign policy, reflecting a new species of Republican leader who wants America to talk tough, avoid war, punish its enemies through economic sanctions and prod allies to pick up a larger share of the tab. In this worldview, only stubbornly anti-American governments like Venezuela\u2019s are castigated for abusing and stealing from their own citizens; the domestic misbehavior of countries like Turkey, Egypt and Saudi Arabia will be ignored so long as their foreign policies remain friendly. Iran, despite its relatively fair elections, did wrong by trying to go nuclear and backing militias that attack United States-allied forces in the region.\nMuch of this vision was put forward in the administration\u2019s National Security Strategy, a document produced during Trump\u2019s first year in office. North Korea, like Iran, is a \u201crogue regime,\u201d the lowest of the low, but its more advanced nuclear program means it holds a higher hand, so it gets a temporary pass in exchange for ceasing nuclear tests and talking nice about giving up its weapons. Russia and China, for their part, are strategic competitors, the military-industrial complex\u2019s new reason for being as the threat of terrorism fades. America would also make good on its outstanding commitments, including the war against ISIS in Syria and Iraq, to which America would contribute \u201cuntil they are destroyed.\u201d\nThe frugal-hawk platform is an appealing one for taxpayers who have laid out trillions for post-9/11 military interventions but still can\u2019t stomach the idea of America in full retreat. A good chunk of it isn\u2019t so different from that of the president Trump replaced. In some places, like North Korea, Trump has applied his unorthodox tactics to the establishment\u2019s orthodox goals. In other places, he has tried to color so far outside the lines that his ideas have been either been heavily discounted (exiting Syria now; threatening to leave NATO) or have disappeared completely (a joint investigation with Russian intelligence on United States soil, which Trump endorsed at Helsinki).\nTrump\u2019s major substantive difference with Obama has been over the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or J.C.P.O.A., more commonly referred to as \u201cthe Iran deal.\u201d Kerry and Obama labored mightily to get France, Russia, China, Britain and Germany on board with having Iran drastically cut its enrichment of uranium in exchange for lifting economic sanctions. Tillerson helped persuade Trump to delay his long-promised exit of the deal; Trump finally exited in May, to the delight of Israel and Saudi Arabia, two countries whose leaders much prefer Trump to Obama.\nAmong former Obama-era officials, there are concerns that Pompeo\u2019s previous role as director of the C.I.A. may have helped him influence Trump\u2019s decision to exit. \u201cOn one level, as C.I.A. director, it should have been none of Pompeo\u2019s business to recommend staying or not staying in the deal,\u201d says Tony Blinken, who served as Kerry\u2019s deputy. \u201cHis job as C.I.A. director was to give an objective analysis of whether Iran was sticking with its commitments, not whether the U.S. should be in or out. That\u2019s a policy question. That\u2019s not the C.I.A. director\u2019s job.\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t the first C.I.A. director to be a former congressman,\u201d Pompeo responded, when I brought up his influence over policy during the interview in his office. He added: \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty clear that the most political C.I.A. director in history was my predecessor\u201d \u2014 John Brennan, who has emerged as a vociferous critic of the new administration since leaving office.\n[Read Mattathias\u2019s profile of John Brennan.]\nIf Pompeo has succeeded in defining Donald Trump\u2019s foreign policy, he has made similar strides in advancing a story about Trump the man that is consistent, if not always convincing. Pompeo\u2019s Trump is the Trump of the National Security Strategy, a wise and clearheaded executive who knows what he wants and has respect for the collaborative nature of statecraft. Pompeo\u2019s Trump is someone who is willing to shame rogue nations with \u201cmoral clarity,\u201d just as Ronald Reagan declared his allegiance to the long-suffering people of the Soviet Union by calling out its leadership as \u201can evil empire.\u201d Trump\u2019s instructions percolate down through his cabinet in the form of something called \u201ccommander\u2019s intent,\u201d a military concept used to help units interpret their missions. Even his apparently impulsive tweets, in Pompeo\u2019s telling, are part of a broader campaign of \u201ctargeted rhetorical and practical pressure\u201d meant to bring \u201coutlaw regimes\u201d to heel, as Pompeo put it in a Foreign Affairs article. (An administration official elaborated on this account, telling me that some @realDonaldTrump tweets are written at the suggestion of agencies and then workshopped by the White House communications team. Early-morning tweets, they said, are more likely to be unfiltered Trump.)\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent a lot of time building an understanding of what President Trump\u2019s mission statement is,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cAnd therefore, what my mission statement is. Commander\u2019s intent. What is it that we are trying to accomplish, and how is it that we\u2019re going to deliver that for the American people?\u201d To Pompeo\u2019s supporters, his gift for channeling the president\u2019s true intent has helped bring a strong sense of direction to the department. \u201cHe builds bonds of mutual respect and common purpose in organizations he leads,\u201d said Gen. H.R. McMaster, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser. \u201cHe is comfortable with relinquishing control to those he trusts.\u201d Ulrich Brechbuhl, Pompeo\u2019s counselor at the State Department, who has known him since they attended West Point, says: \u201cHe thinks of things in terms of the mission. How do you know if you\u2019ve achieved your mission? What are the resources you need to accomplish the mission? And what is the game plan to apply those resources to the mission?\u201d\nBy statute, the role of foreign-service officers is different from that of soldiers. In addition to following orders, they engage in \u201cpolicy formulation.\u201d But under Pompeo, State has emphasized unity and obedience in a distinctly military fashion. \u201cWe take our direction from the commander in chief,\u201d he wrote in an internal newsletter about a gathering of 185 heads of United States missions around the world called One Team, One Mission, One Future. When Vice President Mike Pence addressed the group at Main State, he called Trump \u201cour one team captain.\u201d He rattled off some marching orders from the commander: The diplomats, whom he called \u201cour front-line emissaries,\u201d were to return to their posts and inform allies that the United States\u2019 Southern border would be secured; that peace would be preserved through the \u201cstrongest military in the history of the world\u201d; and that \u201cpeople of faith\u201d would be championed around the world. \u201cAmerica is back,\u201d he said.\nPompeo was born in 1963 in Orange, Calif. His parents, who met through their work, each had a career in aerospace. His father served in the Navy during the Korean War, but Pompeo\u2019s interest in attending West Point was sparked, he said, by a catalog he chanced upon in his high school counselor\u2019s office. \u201cIt looked to me to be a very egalitarian place, where if someone went there and did their best and worked hard, you might have a chance of being very, very successful.\u201d\nWhile he attended church growing up, his Christian faith intensified at West Point, where he joined a small Bible-study group led by older cadets. He graduated first in his class, in 1986, during the last years of the Cold War. After training, he shipped off to Germany to serve as a second lieutenant in an Army tank unit. Pompeo was stateside when the Berlin Wall fell, but he does remember speaking with a fellow soldier who was there. \u201cHe said, \u2018They\u2019re only coming one direction.\u2019 Toward freedom, right?\u201d In Pompeo\u2019s view, the Kremlin is still among the authoritarian regimes that the United States needs to call out and shame. \u201cIf the people know what it was those governments were up to \u2014 in Russia, for example, the corruption that takes place \u2014 the people wouldn\u2019t stand for it, and they wouldn\u2019t tolerate it, and they\u2019d seek new leadership.\u201d\nPompeo\u2019s unit did not deploy to Iraq for the first gulf war. The military was getting smaller, and there were fewer opportunities to advance, so he left shortly afterward, having done the five years\u2019 service required of West Point graduates. He was accepted to Harvard Law School, where he was mentored by Prof. Mary Ann Glendon, a conservative Catholic who later served under George W. Bush as the United States\u2019 ambassador to the Holy See in Rome.\nAt that time, Pompeo seemed to be headed for conventional success as a corporate lawyer. Then, in the mid-1990s, he made a series of changes: divorcing his wife; leaving his job at a top-flight Washington law firm; and moving to Kansas, to go into business with three of his West Point classmates, including Brechbuhl. The group\u2019s analysis showed a concentration around Wichita of small, valuable aerospace companies owned by families with no succession plans \u2014 and so the group set out to acquire some of them. The partners named their company Thayer Aerospace, after an 18th-century brigadier general who was an early West Point superintendent. Among Thayer\u2019s investors were Charles and David Koch, the billionaire brothers who own a controlling share of the privately held Koch Industries and are a dominant force in Kansas politics and the national Republican Party. \u201cMike is a very determined person,\u201d says Marc Short, who was president of Freedom Partners, a Koch-funded nonprofit, and will soon be chief of staff to Vice President Pence. The Kochs, he says, \u201cwere passive investors in Thayer. The introduction came through business circles.\u201d\nIn 2006, Pompeo sold his interest in Thayer and spent the next few years running an oil-field-supply business. He served on the board of a performing-arts center and a Koch-affiliated think tank. In 2000, he married Susan Justice Mostruous, a former Wichita State homecoming queen who worked as a senior vice president at a local bank. Pompeo had some ties to the Wichita area through his mother\u2019s family; Susan knew the local terrain well through her work with alumni groups and charities. Susan had a 9-year-old son, Nick, from her second marriage. Pompeo, who has no other children, legally adopted him as his own. \u201cIt was a very personal, emotional moment when we first told Nick that we were going to get married,\u201d Susan told me.\nIn 2010, Pompeo ran for Congress against Raj Goyle. Unlike Pompeo, Goyle, who is Indian-American, grew up in Kansas; Pompeo\u2019s campaign used Goyle\u2019s ethnicity to paint him as an outsider. The campaign\u2019s Facebook and Twitter feeds shared a blog post by a retired Marine that called Goyle a \u201cturban topper\u201d along with \u201cthe evil muslim communist USURPER,\u201d President Obama. (The campaign apologized and claimed it had been \u201cinadvertently posted.\u201d) Later, a pro-Pompeo billboard from an outside group urged Kansas to \u201cVote American.\u201d Goyle told me he faults Pompeo for not condemning the billboard. \u201cSecretary Pompeo is a shrewd politician, and I understand he says that he respects people of all backgrounds,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when it counted, his campaign tolerated race-based personal attacks to win an election. I\u2019ve moved on, but I\u2019ll never forget that.\u201d\nDuring Obama\u2019s second term, Republican members of Congress with military experience and graduate degrees were looking for places where they could undermine his approach to the Muslim world. Starting in 2015, Pompeo, along with Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, another Army-trained, Harvard-educated Tea Party firebrand, began to mount an attack on the administration\u2019s attempts to improve relations with Iran. Pompeo and Cotton went together on an investigative trip to Vienna, which also took them to London, where Cotton and Pompeo met Gina Haspel, the C.I.A. station chief there. Later, Pompeo would recommend Haspel to replace him at as the head of the agency. Cotton told me that their military training taught them to persevere in what they saw as their duty to expose the mistakes of the Obama White House. \u201cYou learn to make life-changing decisions on the fly,\u201d he says. \u201cIt trains you in boldness, audacity. To always push forward, to stay on offense.\u201d\nDuring the 2016 primary, Pompeo initially backed Marco Rubio. He delivered a speech at the Kansas caucus, where he said that \u201cit\u2019s time to turn the lights down on the circus\u201d and even warned, The Wichita Eagle reported, of a potentially authoritarian presidency. But after Trump won the primary, Pompeo moved into the fold, offering advice to Trump\u2019s vice-presidential pick, Mike Pence, on foreign policy. Pompeo rode the elevator up to the president-elect\u2019s suite in Trump Tower the week after the election, and that same week he was announced as the president-elect\u2019s choice at the C.I.A.\nOn Jan. 7 of this year, the secretary and Mrs. Pompeo flew to the Middle East with a packed schedule. Over eight days, there were plans for 13 bilateral meetings, two strategic dialogues, eight working meals and five \u201cmeet and greets\u201d with United States Embassy personnel.\nPompeo had a lot of work to do. He would be paying respects to small countries (Qatar, Bahrain) that host important United States bases and the big accounts (Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan) that have long acted as United States proxies. To outsiders, the face-to-face interactions that form the heart of diplomacy are a black box. You can try reading something into the arrangement of the seats, the duration of the meetings and the faces of the participants before and after. But it might be years before a full account of what was said emerges.\nTo move Pompeo and his team among all these rooms, he would travel, as every secretary of state does, in a kind of imperial bubble. I was one of eight journalists given a berth within it. Blocks of rooms in luxury hotels are purchased. Highways are closed off for the motorcade\u2019s swift passage. Entire airports are repurposed for the secretary\u2019s plane. Our passports were held by the State Department and returned afterward, full of visas and stamps, despite our never having stopped at a checkpoint or spoken to an immigration official. The world in which statesmen dwell has no borders or walls.\nA few minutes after takeoff, Pompeo walked back to the reporters\u2019 seats and said he would be carrying a message of ongoing United States commitment to the fight against ISIS and the diplomatic effort against Iran. \u201cOur commitment to support Middle East stability is still full-throttle,\u201d he said. When asked about the withdrawal from Syria, he replied, \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about timelines,\u201d his eyes turning downward. His voice took on an edge when he had to repeat the same answer.\nOn Syria, Trump\u2019s team had been quietly nibbling away at the tweeted position of an immediate withdrawal. \u201cThere\u2019s no contradiction whatsoever,\u201d Pompeo said two days later, when asked about apparent differences. \u201cThis is a story made up by the media.\u201d\nPompeo is still learning how to interact with the press, something he didn\u2019t have to do nearly as often at the C.I.A. He\u2019ll often respond to hard questions as if they were rude questions, with the words \u201cridiculous\u201d or \u201cludicrous.\u201d For a senior official who is the face of United States foreign policy, the threshold for triggering his temper is unusually low.\nThe outbursts are not random. Pompeo tends to flare up around those issues where the tensions between the president and the diplomatic corps are greatest. \u201cThere\u2019s no difference,\u201d Pompeo answered, when I asked why he had referred to \u201cIslamist\u201d terrorism in Cairo instead of the \u201cIslamic\u201d terrorism that Pence and Trump talk about on the stump. But clearly, there is a difference. And a few minutes after Pompeo suggested that his choice of \u201cIslamist\u201d was accidental, a senior State Department official, unaware of the answer Pompeo had just given, told me that \u201cIslamist\u201d was a \u201cdeliberate choice\u201d made for the sake of depriving terrorists of religious legitimacy.\nThe next day, after the transcript of my exchange with Pompeo circulated, the senior official revised his answer. \u201cIt\u2019s all the same,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to hide behind words.\u201d The most generous reading of this discrepancy is that the White House simply doesn\u2019t agree with United States allies and counterterrorism experts around the world that the gap between these two words matters. You could also call it \u201ccommander\u2019s caprice\u201d \u2014 the president\u2019s servants awkwardly jitterbugging as they try to follow the leader.\nDuring Pompeo\u2019s speech in Cairo, despite the embassy\u2019s efforts to pack the room, he earned exactly one midspeech burst of applause: after he thanked Sisi, the Egyptian president, \u201cfor his courage.\u201d That burst, beginning in the middle of the room and flowing toward the front, where Pompeo\u2019s inner circle was seated, originated with a middle-aged American sitting in the row behind me. He had straw-colored hair, glasses and an easygoing manner. His name was Joel C. Rosenberg. Pompeo, he said, was a fan of his books. Rosenberg told me that Pompeo\u2019s staff had contacted him a few years ago and asked to meet; the two had kept in touch since then. (A person close to Pompeo confirmed that the two men were acquainted, and that Pompeo had read Rosenberg\u2019s books.)\nRosenberg is a best-selling author and a powerful force in the evangelical movement. Born to a Jewish father and a Christian mother, he immigrated to Israel and now lives in Jerusalem with his family as a dual citizen. Some of Rosenberg\u2019s books deal with biblical prophecies about the end of the world. Others deal with the future of the Middle East. One work of speculative nonfiction, \u201cEpicenter,\u201d explores connections between the two. When asked on Fox News in 2013 if the Syria conflict could lead to the fulfillment of biblical end-times prophecies from the Books of Isaiah and Jeremiah, he replied, \u201cWe don\u2019t know for certain,\u201d adding: \u201cIt is possible, because these prophecies have not yet been fulfilled.\u201d Elsewhere, he has suggested that the War of Gog and Magog, an apocalyptic battle prophesied in Ezekiel and Revelation, will involve Jordan, Russia and Iran. He has met personally with the king of Jordan and Mohammed bin Salman. In 2017, he joined an evangelical delegation for a meeting with President Sisi. He is also friendly with Vice President Pence, who showed his family around the West Wing during Trump\u2019s first year in office.\nRosenberg and I rode with Pompeo\u2019s motorcade out to an enormous Coptic cathedral in what is slated to become Cairo\u2019s new administrative capital \u2014 a vast desert moonscape where Sisi has promised a reported $45 billion of state-planned development. The cathedral is an official gesture of Sisi\u2019s solidarity with Egypt\u2019s Coptic Christians, who have been frequently targeted by terrorists. Even as it has shifted away from calling out authoritarian rulers like Sisi, the Trump administration has emphasized protecting the rights of \u201creligious minorities,\u201d conspicuously Christians in the Middle East \u2014 a priority it calls \u201creligious freedom.\u201d\nAfter touring the cathedral, Pompeo took one question from the traveling pool on the rights of religious minorities and then gave a longer interview, arranged by Rosenberg, with the Christian Broadcasting Network. \u201cChristianity is at the heart of the history of this place here in the Middle East,\u201d he said. \u201cAll you got to do is grab a Bible and read the places and the names.\u201d Before returning to the hotel, he and Susan toured a brand-new mosque a short way up the road. Like the church, he said, it was a place where \u201cthe Lord is clearly at work.\u201d\nSome Democrats have attacked the policy implications of Pompeo\u2019s religiosity. During his confirmation hearing for secretary of state, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey brought up a 2015 speech that Pompeo gave at Summit Church in Kansas. Speaking with an ease and humor that were missing from his delivery in Cairo, Pompeo had approvingly quoted a pastor who denounced an America where we \u201cworshiped other gods and called it multiculturalism and endorsed perversion and called it an alternative lifestyle.\u201d In response to Booker\u2019s repeatedly demanding a yes-or-no answer to the question of whether he considered homosexuality to be a perversion, Pompeo demurred.\nA few days after the Cairo speech, in the midst of a strategic dialogue in Qatar, I had the chance to ask Pompeo about his religious views. I brought up another line from the 2015 speech, given at the invitation of Summit\u2019s pastor at the time, Terry Fox. Near the end, Pompeo spoke of \u201cthe Rapture,\u201d a term that doesn\u2019t appear in the New Testament but is associated by some evangelicals with passages that presage the end of the world and the bodily ascension of believers into heaven. \u201cWe will continue to fight these battles,\u201d Pompeo said in 2015. \u201cIt is a never-ending struggle until that moment, folks, Pastor Fox spoke about. Until the Rapture.\u201d\n\u201cThere are 40,000-page treatises on Christianity,\u201d Pompeo explained to me in Qatar. \u201cWe are not going to be able to begin to scratch the surface of the question that you just asked me. I am sufficiently humble to recognize that my exegesis of the Bible in 30 seconds is going to fail.\u201d\nI asked what he meant by the Rapture at the time.\n\u201cLook, read the book,\u201d he said. \u201cCapital T, capital B.\u201d He brought up the doctrines of human dignity and the Ten Commandments. Without mentioning the Rapture directly, he circled around to the concept of resurrection. \u201cThese are central tenets that form the foundation of the faith of Christianity,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the central idea that it is through the grace of God we will all accede to heaven. Those are basic conceptions that people have had in mind for thousands of years.\u201d\nPompeo \u201chas never wavered in his biblical convictions,\u201d Pastor Fox told me in a phone conversation. \u201cThere can be a great cost to any politician who stands on biblical principles. Most people will bend and become more moderate in their strong biblical convictions, with marriage and abortion and things like that. He has not done that. He\u2019s stood strong, no matter what the political cost.\u201d\nPompeo, he said, spoke at the church on multiple occasions while in Congress. \u201cWe\u2019re proud of him,\u201d Fox said. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to force his views on anyone. When he represented Kansas, he represented all people, whether they were Christians or not.\u201d\nIn his reference to the Rapture, Fox said, Pompeo had meant \u201cstaying faithful to the word of God. Stay faithful to your beliefs. Until the Lord comes to take us home. The Lord is coming back, and the Christians will be called to meet him in the air. It\u2019s a reference to the Last Days. That\u2019s what he would have meant by that.\u201d\nThe most sensitive bilateral meeting on Pompeo\u2019s schedule was in Saudi Arabia, with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Prince Mohammed, also known as M.B.S., is close to Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who sees him as a keystone of a hoped-for Israel-Palestine peace deal. Inconveniently, both for Trump and for the venerable United States-Saudi relationship, M.B.S. also appears to be a murderer. According to the medium-to-high-confidence assessment of the C.I.A., M.B.S. ordered the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi dissident, Washington Post contributor and resident of Virginia; the agency has concluded that Khashoggi was lured to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 under the pretext of obtaining documents for an impending marriage, then strangled with a plastic bag and cut to pieces with a bone saw. M.B.S.\u2019s responsibility for Khashoggi\u2019s murder is the latest conclusion reached by the United States intelligence community that Trump has been unwilling to accept.\nPompeo made his first trip to the Saudi Royal Court to discuss the Khashoggi murder on Oct. 16. Under previous presidents, such a meeting would most likely have been one on one, with Pompeo\u2019s leverage in the room enhanced by Trump\u2019s absence. But on this day, @realDonaldTrump managed to thrust himself into the center of the world-historical spotlight. Somehow, in the middle of the Pompeo-M.B.S. meeting, Trump himself got on the phone with M.B.S. Almost immediately, he tweeted a readout of their exchange. M.B.S. had \u201ctotally denied any knowledge of what took place. \u2026 Answers will be forthcoming shortly,\u201d he announced. That was four months ago. Trump said that if M.B.S. knew about the murder, \u201cthat would be bad,\u201d and then subsequently that \u201cit could very well be that the crown prince had knowledge of this tragic event.\u201d\nPompeo implied that the call had been his idea. \u201cI wanted to make sure that the president heard directly from the crown prince,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt was important that the two of them connect directly.\u201d The most lasting images from the first Pompeo-M.B.S. meeting were photos of Pompeo, smiling broadly as he sat across from M.B.S. and bantered about jet lag. \u201cHe was all smiles and happiness, as though it were not a significant issue for an ally to assassinate an American resident and journalist,\u201d says Senator Jeff Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon.\nThis time, Pompeo seemed intent on at least giving the appearance that M.B.S. didn\u2019t have the White House in his pocket. The Saudi legal process had not yet \u201chit that threshold of credibility and accountability,\u201d a senior State Department official said during a background call laying out plans for the trip. In Riyadh, the Saudis seemed equally intent on engaging in some chest-thumping. The first sign came moments after landing, when Pompeo was corralled into a four-on-four pull-aside at the airport with M.B.S.\u2019s brother. A spokesman insisted that the meeting was not a surprise, but one of Pompeo\u2019s four, Ambassador David Satterfield, had to dash back across the rugs of the V.I.P. terminal and into the closed chamber where tea was already being poured. The plan had been for Pompeo and M.B.S. to meet that night. We soon learned that the meeting had been pushed back to the following morning.\nAfter two hours of breakfasting and waiting around, the motorcade drove from the hotel to the Saudi Royal Court, arriving at its black steel gates eight minutes before 10 in the morning. We crossed two sets of high inner gates, past an armored vehicle with a gun turret and around a large fountain that flowed beneath an enormous Saudi flag hanging slack in the desert air.\nWalking with Pompeo as he entered the Royal Court was Joe Semrad, his low-key and unfailingly polite special assistant, carrying two zippered black briefcases full of Pompeo\u2019s papers. Just inside the entrance, near the X-ray scanner, there was a raised-voice argument with Saudi security about whether the briefcases could remain in Semrad\u2019s possession. The American charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires tried to use his Arabic to intercede with a member of the Saudi Royal Guard. \u201cI speak English!\u201d the guard exclaimed. The Saudis prevailed, and the briefcases were sent back to the motorcade. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to make such a scene,\u201d Semrad told me later. \u201cThey were just doing their job, and I was doing mine.\u201d\nThe interior of the Royal Court has a martial vibe. The octagonal entrance chamber has a model of the old Riyadh fortress at its center. The rugs that lay over the marble floors muffled the sandaled footfalls of the robed and bearded men of the court who stood now in small groups, a safe distance away from the visitors, their heads bent in conversation. Some carried guns; some wore swords. There were no Saudi women to be seen inside the building. The American women dressed modestly, in pants and long-sleeved shirts; they did not cover their heads. Pompeo and his four diplomats were waiting in an antechamber, where they languished for a full 15 minutes before being summoned down a long corridor, smoky with incense, where M.B.S.\u2019s father, King Salman, was waiting. Just as Pompeo extended his right hand for a shake, a courtier relieved the king of his ivory-handled cane.\nLater, as M.B.S. walked Pompeo to the exit after a private one on one, a Saudi photographer caught the two men walking in sync. M.B.S. looks calm and thoughtful. Pompeo, mid-stride, grins as though he is in the midst of telling a joke. On his own feed, @SecPompeo wore the solemn face of man seeking, as the tweet put it, \u201caccountability\u201d on Khashoggi. He would repeat that word many times over the coming days as Republicans in Congress continued to indicate that they considered the White House line on Khashoggi to be unacceptable.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a ridiculous question,\u201d Pompeo said in mid-February, when asked if he believed the CIA\u2019s assessment that M.B.S. was responsible for the killing. Then, without mentioning M.B.S. by name, he repeated the promises that had been the administration\u2019s line since Trump\u2019s October tweet. The Saudi relationship was important. The murder was bad. The investigation was continuing. \u201cFact sets\u201d were being developed. \u201cWe will hold everyone responsible for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi accountable.\u201d\nThese equivocations made it easy to forget that there had actually been a private conversation between M.B.S. and Pompeo. What happened during their meeting? According to tweets from the Saudi foreign ministry, the two men \u201creviewed the historic relations between the two friendly countries\u201d and \u201cdiscussed regional and international developments.\u201d Their side made no mention of Khashoggi.\nOn Feb. 1, I saw Pompeo for the last time in the Treaty Room outside his office. I tried to pin him down regarding Khashoggi and got nowhere.\n\u201cAre you comfortable,\u201d I asked, \u201cin your heart of hearts, that M.B.S. had nothing to do with the death of this man?\u201d\n\u201cI know this drives you crazy \u2014 I\u2019ve been painfully consistent,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s an outrageous act. It\u2019s unacceptable.\u201d\nHe said this was the official United States position. I said that I wanted Pompeo\u2019s own position.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Mike Pompeo\u2019s position too,\u201d he said. \u201cSecretary of state \u2014 it\u2019s my position too. We\u2019re going to hold everyone who was responsible for this accountable. Every time the United States government can determine a set of facts, with sufficient confidence, we\u2019re going to hold everyone who was responsible for this accountable. The president has told me that\u2019s my guidance. And, by the way, told others.\u201d He then referenced the sanctions of 17 Saudi officials that had come from the Treasury Department.\n\u201cThat didn\u2019t sound like a yes or no,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I\u2019m happy to leave it \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cYes! The answer is yes. No, the answer is yes. Am I comfortable? Yes.\u201d\n\u201cYou are comfortable that he had nothing to do with this?\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, no. No, you \u2014 no, you asked if I was comfortable with the U.S. position. At least I understood that to be your question.\u201d\n\u201cThe question was, Are you sure he had nothing to do with this. Your answer didn\u2019t sound like a yes or a no.\u201d\n\u201cI gave you my answer. My answer is we\u2019re going to hold everyone that we determine is responsible for this accountable in an appropriate way, a way that reflects the best of the United States of America.\u201d There was more back-and-forth. Pompeo declined to offer a timeline on when the government would have a categorical answer on M.B.S. \u201cWhen we know,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about any particular individual,\u201d he said. \u201cWe continue to work it.\u201d\nIn mid-February, after reports that M.B.S. had told an aide he would use \u201ca bullet\u201d on Khashoggi in 2017, I asked Pompeo if he had anything more to say about the murder. His answer, given by email, was almost identical to what he\u2019d told me before. \u201cThis is an unacceptable murder,\u201d he said. \u201cPresident Trump and this administration are committed to holding each individual accountable as we develop fact sets that permit us to do it.\u201d\nArguably Pompeo\u2019s greatest test so far as secretary of state is in Hanoi, Vietnam, where Trump has his second meeting with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. The meeting is a product of months of intricate negotiations by Pompeo and his team. \u201cToday, if you asked me, I would not say with any conviction that the North Koreans have decided to denuclearize,\u201d says Biegun, the special representative on North Korea. \u201cBut our policies are built around the expectation that they can make that decision.\u201d\nLast year, Trump set a high bar for success \u2014 \u201cthe complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization\u201d of North Korea. Gen. James Clapper, the intelligence chief who handled many of the Obama administration\u2019s negotiations with North Korea, is skeptical that Pompeo and Trump can deliver. \u201cThe North Koreans are NOT going to denuclearize,\u201d Clapper wrote to me in an email. \u201cWhy would they give up what leverage they have, simply because we demand they do so?\u201d When I asked him to give the Trump administration\u2019s performance a letter grade, he said he would give them \u201can \u2018E\u2019 for effort and, at best, an \u2018INC,\u2019 as in incomplete, for results.\u201d\n\u201cPresident Trump and I have both been very clear,\u201d Pompeo responded, when I read him Clapper\u2019s critique in early February. \u201cWe set about developing a strategy that maximized the likelihood that we would get the outcome that the world wants.\u201d\nBiegun points to the rapport between Trump and Kim as a positive sign. \u201cAt the leader level, the chemistry was quite good,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it was exactly what it looked like.\u201d But the chemistry between the two leaders carries its own risks. Two issues that could arise in the negotiation are a formal end to the Korean War and the withdrawal of United States troops from the peninsula. There are concerns that the administration might give away the first for too little; and that Trump himself could overrule his subordinates, take South Korea by surprise, and put the second on the table. Success was hard to imagine unless Kim Jong-un could be made to read Trump as an equal, strong and unwavering, with the whole of the United States government both firmly under his control and standing squarely behind him. Pompeo could design the set, write a script and block out seats for the players. But in the end, it would be a one on one, and Trump would most likely be ad-libbing.\nWhen I sat down for my first interview with Pompeo in his office, his open Bible lay between us on the table. It was well used, with many verses highlighted. A Swiss Army knife marked his place at the end of Esther and the beginning of Job, two books with insight into how to serve a difficult boss. In Job, God is the boss, inflicting his whims on a long-suffering employee who doesn\u2019t know that God is doing all this to win a bet with Satan. In Esther, a vain and fickle king nearly succumbs to the influence of a wicked minister before being tamed with great finesse by Queen Esther, who risks death to get his ear.\nAlong with Vice President Mike Pence and other Trump cabinet members, Pompeo has attended Bible study sessions held in federal offices and led by Ralph Drollinger, the founder of Capitol Ministries. Drollinger has compared Pence to Mordecai, Esther\u2019s uncle and one of the book\u2019s protagonists. Mordecai husbands his influence, remaining loyal to the king even when it looks as if official policy could result in the death of his people. Drollinger has praised Mordecai\u2019s \u201coutward respect for the king, strongly suggesting inward respect, at least for the office\u201d; he \u201cdisplays a manifest unfaltering loyalty to the country\u2019s civil leader at times when it would have been easy to do otherwise.\u201d Mere displays of loyalty will never suffice. Only an obedient heart can win the king\u2019s favor.\n\u201cIt informs everything I do,\u201d Pompeo said, when I asked him about the Bible. Seeing the pages in question, I tentatively compared Melania Trump to Queen Esther \u2014 both were outsiders married to difficult sovereigns, after all, and the first lady\u2019s trip to the Southern border had seemed to coincide with a softening of Trump\u2019s heart regarding the family-separation policy.\nPompeo absorbed my dubious analogy while looking down at the book on the table. \u201cThere are many lessons,\u201d he said.", "date": "Feb. 26, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/26/magazine/mike-pompeo-translates-trump.html", "tags": "clean united states \u201d trump messes pompeo one mission mike said"}
