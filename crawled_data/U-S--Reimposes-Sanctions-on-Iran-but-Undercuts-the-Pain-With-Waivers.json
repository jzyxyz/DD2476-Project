{"title": "U.S. Reimposes Sanctions on Iran but Undercuts the Pain With Waivers", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration announced on Friday that it was exempting eight countries from bruising sanctions that the United States was reimposing against Iran, undercutting its pledge to economically punish Tehran\u2019s regional aggressions while widening a profound rift with European allies.\nMike Pompeo, the secretary of state, did not identify the eight countries that were being granted six-month waivers, but a senior official confirmed that they include India, South Korea, Japan and China \u2014 among the world\u2019s largest importers of Iranian oil.\nMr. Pompeo said the European Union, which recently announced the creation of an economic channel to continue financial dealings with Iran, was not among those receiving waivers.\nThe sanctions were promised in May, when President Trump announced that the United States was withdrawing from a 2015 deal with world powers to limit Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\nThey were affirmed on Friday, the eve of a long-announced Nov. 5 deadline for nations to cease importing Iranian goods or face financial penalties, and days before crucial midterm elections in which the Trump administration is seeking to galvanize Republicans who support his hard-nosed foreign policy.\nMr. Pompeo said the waivers were granted to the eight countries \u201conly because they have demonstrated significant reductions in their crude oil and cooperation on many other fronts.\u201d He said two of the eight were expected to end their imports of Iranian oil \u201cwithin weeks,\u201d and all must reapply for extended exemptions at the end of six months.\nSouth Korea and China are crucial to keeping pressure on North Korea to eliminate its nuclear weapons \u2014 another top Trump administration priority. Once South Korea was exempted, Mr. Trump could not deny the demands of Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, whom the president has often described as the Asian leader with whom he has the greatest rapport.\nAnd India, like China, will most likely never stop importing Iranian oil; the waivers help \u201cavoid what would potentially be a very painful confrontation,\u201d said Peter Harrell, a sanctions expert during the Obama administration. He said the waivers have also helped keep oil prices in check ahead of Tuesday\u2019s elections.\n\u201cWhatever happened to maximum pressure?\u201d United Against Nuclear Iran, an anti-Iran group led by former Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, wrote on Twitter in response to the administration\u2019s waivers. \u201cThey caved. Big time.\u201d\nThe sanctions \u2014 and dearth of exemptions for European allies \u2014 threaten to dangerously deteriorate already-strained trans-Atlantic ties. Most big European companies have left Iran in recent months ahead of the looming penalties, but European diplomats vowed on Friday to continue efforts to protect legitimate trade with Tehran.\n\u201cOur collective resolve to complete this work is unwavering,\u201d diplomats from the European Union, Britain, France and Germany said in a statement.\nIran remains a part of the nuclear accord, which it brokered in 2015 along with the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China. International inspectors have concluded that Tehran is complying with the agreement by not developing nuclear weapons, and European officials have said that the deal is crucial to their national security.\nR. Nicholas Burns, a top diplomat in the administration of President George W. Bush, said imposing sanctions on countries for remaining part of an accord that the United States helped negotiate would be a huge mistake.\n\u201cWe still need these countries on other vital issues, like containing North Korea and Russia,\u201d Mr. Burns said.\nMany initially lifted as part of the nuclear deal, the sanctions will target more than 700 businesses, individuals and other entities involved in Iran\u2019s oil, banking, shipping, shipbuilding and insurance sectors. They go into effect on Monday and were jointly announced on Friday by Mr. Pompeo and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary.\nSince the United States jettisoned the nuclear deal, Iran\u2019s currency, the rial, has lost more than two-thirds of its value, according to officials and experts, and the country\u2019s oil exports have plunged to 1.5 million barrels daily, from 2.5 million barrels.\nAlready, oil buyers in Europe, Japan and South Korea have largely eliminated imports from Iran. But China, India and Turkey continue to make such purchases.\nThe penalties seek to force Tehran to end what the United States views as Iran\u2019s destabilizing activities in the Middle East, including its support for Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza and the Houthi rebels in Yemen. The sanctions are \u201caimed at depriving the regime of the revenues it uses to spread death and destruction around the world,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said.\nShortly after the new penalties against Iran \u2014 and the waivers \u2014 were announced, Mr. Trump tweeted a poster of himself with the words \u201cSanctions Are Coming,\u201d using the font from the HBO show \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d The words are a play on a well-known phrase from the show, \u201cwinter is coming,\u201d which refers to an impending deep freeze when an army of magical warriors will descend from the north to wipe out all kingdoms.\nRichard Nephew, a top sanctions official during the Obama administration, called Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet \u201cfrankly disgusting\u201d because of the economic pain that sanctions impose on the Iranian public.\n\u201cTake this seriously, please,\u201d Mr. Nephew tweeted back.\nIranian leaders have insisted they have no intention of rewarding Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to leave the nuclear accord by acceding to his demands or even opening a dialogue; just this week, Danish authorities accused Iran of trying to assassinate an Arab separatist leader living in Denmark.\nIn a tweet last month, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif of Iran called American sanctions against his country an \u201cutter disregard for rule of law & human rights of an entire people.\u201d\nWhether Tehran will be able to hold out while its economy suffers is unclear. Iran undertook some of its most aggressive regional moves during the previous round of punishing sanctions between 2012 and 2015.\nSpontaneous protests in Iran have erupted in recent weeks among groups that had long been reliable supporters of the Islamic Republic, and public opinion may have also turned against the government\u2019s relative moderates. Iran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani, had advocated the nuclear deal as a means of improving his country\u2019s economy.\nThe latest penalties are the second, and final, round of sanctions that were suspended as part of the 2015 accord. The first set was reimposed in August, targeting transactions with Iran that involved United States dollar bank notes, gold, precious metals, aluminum, steel, commercial passenger aircraft and coal.\nMr. Mnuchin defended the administration\u2019s decision not to directly impose sanctions on the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, a financial messaging service based in Belgium and known as Swift. Conservatives have insisted that Swift must be punished if it fails to expel Iranian banks from its network.\n\u201cIt is our intent that they cut off designated entities as was done before,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said of Swift.\nMr. Pompeo said the eight countries that have been given waivers will pay for Iranian oil exclusively through a barter system. It requires Iran to be paid in goods rather than cash to limit the country\u2019s ability to use oil sales to fund military activities.\nMr. Pompeo also said the list of waivers is far smaller than the 20 nations that were exempted from American sanctions under President Barack Obama.\nPeace groups denounced the sanctions as \u201cthe latest step in a calculated campaign by this White House to provoke war with Iran,\u201d Paul Kawika Martin of Peace Action said.\nFriday\u2019s announcement is part of Mr. Trump\u2019s enthusiastic embrace of biting economic tools, including tariffs and sanctions, to further his foreign policy aims. But American sanctions on Russia, Venezuela and North Korea have so far produced few tangible victories.", "date": "Nov. 2, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/02/world/middleeast/us-iran-sanctions-oil-waivers.html", "tags": "sanctions iran nuclear u.s. \u201d oil pain waivers reimposes undercuts said"}
