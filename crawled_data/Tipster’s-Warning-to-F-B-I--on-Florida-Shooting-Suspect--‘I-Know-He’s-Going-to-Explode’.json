{"title": "Tipster\u2019s Warning to F.B.I. on Florida Shooting Suspect: \u2018I Know He\u2019s Going to Explode\u2019", "content": "The warnings that law enforcement officials received about Nikolas Cruz were anything but subtle.\n\u201cI know he\u2019s going to explode,\u201d a woman who knew Mr. Cruz said on the F.B.I.\u2019s tip line on Jan. 5. Her big worry was that he might resort to slipping \u201cinto a school and just shooting the place up.\u201d Forty days later, Mr. Cruz is accused of doing just that, barging into his former high school in Parkland, Fla., and shooting 17 people to death.\nThree months before the Feb. 14 massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, a family friend dialed 911 to tell the Palm Beach County sheriff\u2019s office about Mr. Cruz\u2019s personal arsenal. \u201cI need someone here because I\u2019m afraid he comes back and he has a lot of weapons,\u201d the friend said.\nMr. Cruz, 19, himself called the authorities just after Thanksgiving, describing how he had been in a fight and was struggling with the death of his mother. \u201cThe thing is I lost my mother a couple of weeks ago, so like I am dealing with a bunch of things right now,\u201d he said in a childlike voice, sounding agitated and out of breath.\nThe authorities have acknowledged mishandling numerous warning signs that Mr. Cruz was deeply troubled. There were tips to the F.B.I. about disturbing social media posts. There were visits by social services to his home. There were dozens of calls to 911 and the local authorities, some mentioning fears that he was capable of violence.\nReviewing the transcripts of those calls, and listening to the audiotapes of some of them, is a chilling exercise that makes Mr. Cruz\u2019s arrest in one of America\u2019s deadliest school shootings seem less than a complete surprise. (Read the transcripts here.)\nIn a 911 call on Nov. 29, Rocxanne Deschamps, the family friend who took in Mr. Cruz after the death of his mother, expressed fear that he was going to get a gun after fighting with her son. Ms. Deschamps lives in a faded, off-white mobile home, where Mr. Cruz and his younger brother, Zachary, stayed with her briefly.\nIn Ms. Deschamps\u2019s 911 call, she told the dispatcher that Mr. Cruz already had about eight guns that he kept at a friend\u2019s house and that he had just been thrown out of the house after the tantrum in which he punched the walls, hurled things around her home and got into a fight with Rock, her 22-year-old son.\n\u201cHe got pissed off and then he came in the house and started banging all the doors and banging in the walls and hitting the walls and throwing everything in the room,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then my son got in there and he said, \u2018Stop it,\u2019 and he didn\u2019t want to stop.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cIt\u2019s not the first time he put a gun on somebody\u2019s head.\u201d Ms. Deschamps made it clear that her new houseguest was obsessed with firearms and had threatened both his mother and his brother. \u201cThat\u2019s all he wants is his gun,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s all he cares about is his gun. He bought tons of bullets and stuff and I took it away from him.\u201d\nMs. Deschamps declined to comment on Friday, and her lawyer did not respond to phone messages and emails over the past week.\nMore than once, Mr. Cruz was identified by those around him as someone capable of carrying out a school shooting.\nOn Nov. 30, two and a half months before the Parkland massacre, an unidentified caller from Massachusetts told the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Office that Mr. Cruz was collecting guns and knives and that \u201che could be a school shooter in the making.\u201d\nTwo years before, the office reported receiving \u201cthirdhand information\u201d from the son of one of Mr. Cruz\u2019s neighbors that he \u201cplanned to shoot up the school on Instagram.\u201d\nThe tip that the F.B.I. received in early January from someone close to Mr. Cruz suggested that he owned a gun and had talked about carrying out a school shooting. But the bureau failed to investigate, even though the tipster said Mr. Cruz had a \u201cdesire to kill people, erratic behavior and disturbing social media posts.\u201d\nThat information should have been sent to the Miami F.B.I. field office, the bureau said.\nThe F.B.I. also received a tip from a bail bondsman in Mississippi in September about a suspicious comment left on his YouTube channel by a \u201cnikolas cruz\u201d who professed a desire to be a \u201cprofessional school shooter.\u201d The bondsman notified YouTube, which promptly took down the comment.\nThe F.B.I. said it did not have enough information to determine if \u201cnikolas cruz\u201d was a real name or a pseudonym, and the bureau said it could not justify keeping a file on the tip open and closed it in October.\nWhen the second tip reached the F.B.I. in West Virginia in January, a specialist was able to view the earlier tip, too. But even then, the specialist, in consultation with her supervisor, decided that there was not enough evidence to pursue it and that it did not appear to be an imminent threat.\nThe acting F.B.I. deputy director, David L. Bowdich, briefed congressional staff members about the case on Friday and acknowledged the bureau\u2019s failure to investigate, according to three people with direct knowledge of the meeting.\nOver the course of the January call, which lasted more than 13 minutes, the tipster warned the F.B.I. that Mr. Cruz had been adrift since his mother\u2019s death in November. She said that Mr. Cruz had \u201cthe mental capacity of a 12 to a 14 year old.\u201d The tipster provided four Instagram accounts for Mr. Cruz, which she said showed photos of sliced up animals and the firearms he had amassed. The caller, whose name was redacted on the transcript, said Mr. Cruz had used money from his mother\u2019s account after her death to purchase the weapons.\n\u201cIf you go onto his Instagram pages, you\u2019ll see all the guns,\u201d the woman said.\nBefore calling the F.B.I., the woman telephoned Broward sheriff\u2019s deputies in Parkland, worried that Mr. Cruz might kill himself. But she did not hear back from them and became increasingly alarmed after she said Mr. Cruz posted online that \u201che wants to kill people.\u201d\nTwo deputies have been placed on restricted duty while the Broward office investigates how two calls about Mr. Cruz \u2014 the one in November and an earlier one in 2016 \u2014 may have been mishandled.\nBefore she died in early November, Mr. Cruz\u2019s mother, Lynda Cruz, had called the authorities numerous times over the past decade to report her son. She said he had hit her with the plastic hose from a vacuum, and once threw her against the wall after she took his Xbox away, adding that he suffered from anger issues as well as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder.\nMr. Cruz progressed to more distressing behavior, including possibly shooting a neighbor\u2019s chicken with a BB gun, collecting hate symbols, cutting himself, and possibly swallowing gasoline in a failed suicide attempt, according to complaints to the local authorities.", "date": "Feb. 23, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/23/us/fbi-tip-nikolas-cruz.html", "tags": "shooting suspect mother \u2018 f.b.i know going warning cruz \u201c explode school gun florida tip said tipster"}
