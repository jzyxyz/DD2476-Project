{"title": "Texas Lawmakers Are Considering The Death Penalty For Women Who Get Abortions", "content": "Texas lawmakers worked well into Tuesday morning as they listened to hundreds of Texans testify in support of a bill that would criminalize abortion and threaten the death penalty to any woman who undergoes the procedure.\u00a0\nIn total 446 people testified in support of the \u201cAbolition of Abortion in Texas Act,\u201d or\u00a0House Bill 896, which aims to outlaw all abortions \u201cregardless of any contrary federal law, executive order, or court decision.\u201d State Rep. Tony Tinderholt (R)\u00a0introduced the bill in 2017, which would define abortion as murder which is punishable by death in the state of Texas.\u00a0\n\u201cGod\u2019s word says, \u2018He who sheds man\u2019s blood, by man \u2015 the civil government \u2015 his blood will be shed,\u2019\u201d Sonya Gonnella, a supporter of the bill, testified in the hearing before the Texas House\u2019s Committee on Judiciary and Civil Jurisprudence on Monday.\u00a0\nAfter quoting the Book of Genesis, Gonella implored the committee to \u201crepent with us\u201d by passing the proposed legislation.\u00a0\nLawmakers in the hearing,\u00a0which wrapped around 3 a.m. on Tuesday, also heard from people opposed to the bill. In total 54 Texans, including women\u2019s advocates and legal experts, testified against the bill, according to\u00a0the Washington Post.\u00a0\nSupporters of the bill gathered in Texas Capitol Rotunda ahead of the hearing on Monday night, chanting \u201cabolish abortion\u201d and \u201cequal protection for all.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to reconcile in my head the arguments that I heard tonight about how essentially one is OK with subjecting a woman to the death penalty... to do to her the exact same thing that one is alleging she is doing to a child,\u201d state Rep. Victoria Neave (D) said during the hearing.\nThe proposed legislation would ban abortion at every stage of pregnancy, even in cases of rape and incest, and it would modify Texas\u2019 state penal code to allow both women and abortion providers to be charged with murder. Tinderholt\u2019s bill defines an embryo as \u201ca living human child\u201d beginning at \u201cthe moment of fertilization.\u201d\nUnder the proposed legislation, an embryo would be afforded the same \u201crights, powers, and privileges as are secured or granted by the laws of this state to any other human child.\u201d\nThe bill is in direct conflict with Roe v. Wade,\u00a0which makes criminalizing abortion blatantly unconstitutional.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to remember that if a drunk driver kills a pregnant woman, they get charged twice. If you murder a pregnant woman, you get charged twice. So I\u2019m not specifically criminalizing women. What I\u2019m doing is equalizing the law,\u201d Tinderholt said during the hearing, according to Fox 9.\nTinderholt, an uber-conservative anti-abortion advocate, initially received death threats for his controversial bill, which he\u00a0introduced in January 2017. Although the bill did not get a hearing in 2017, renewed efforts to roll back abortions rights across the country helped bolster the controversial act to receive attention from the state House.\u00a0\nThe chairman of the Texas House committee Rep. Jeff Leach (R) announced last week that in the spirit of creating a \u201cculture of life\u201d he would grant a hearing on Tinderholt\u2019s bill, Dallas News reported.\u00a0\nLeach, however, appeared to be openly reluctant about a bill that is so flagrantly unconstitutional.\u00a0\n\u201cI am pro-life, through and through. No one can question my credentials on this issue and my commitment to this important cause,\u201d he said. \u201cThat said, I do not believe that convicting a woman who has an abortion of murder and possibly subjecting her to the death penalty is constitutional, nor does such a policy advance the cause of life in Texas.\u201d\u00a0\nLeach isn\u2019t the only anti-abortion advocate who feels uneasy about the bill. Texans for Life, an anti-abortion organization, told HuffPost it does not support the controversial proposal.\n\u201cTexans for Life does not support any bill on abortion that would penalize women. Penalizing women only protects the abortionist,\u201d Texans for Life President Kyleen Wright said.\n\u201cAs a practical matter, one can\u2019t put the abortionist out of business without the help of the woman,\u201d she continued. \u201cThere is also the grave concern that women facing penalties of any kind would not seek help in the event of complications.\u201d\nAnother Texas-based anti-abortion organization, Texas Alliance for Life, also opposes the bill. Executive Director Dr.\u00a0Joe Pojman told HuffPost that the organization does not support the bill because \u201cit has little chance of surviving a federal court challenge as it violates Supreme Court precedent.\u201d\n\u201cWe are greatly concerned that HB 896 criminalizes women on whom an abortion is performed. We strongly oppose that policy,\u201d he added. \u201cWomen were never prosecuted for abortion before Roe v. Wade in Texas or in any other state.\u201d\u00a0\nTinderholt told HuffPost on Wednesday that \u201cthere is a lot of misinformation\u201d being spread about his proposed bill.\n\u201cMy bill simply accomplishes one goal. It brings equal treatment for unborn human beings under the law,\u201d he said, in part, adding:\u00a0\nTinderholt\u00a0told the Texas Observer in 2017 that the policy would force women to be \u201cmore personally responsible\u201d for their sexual behavior.\u00a0", "date": "\n04/10/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/texas-lawmakers-are-considering-the-death-penalty-for-women-who-get-abortions_n_5cade41ae4b0d6eb63c26324?ncid=engmodushpmg00000004", "tags": "hearing abortions considering death get \u201d tinderholt woman abortion penalty bill women lawmakers texas"}
