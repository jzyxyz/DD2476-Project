{"title": "Russians, Feeling Poor and Protesting Garbage, Suffer Winter Blues", "content": "URDOMA, Russia \u2014 Russia\u2019s countryside and smaller cities have long been fertile ground for President Vladimir V. Putin and his message of restoring bygone greatness, but even here, there are limits.\nPlans to ship Moscow\u2019s garbage to the provinces \u2014 abetted by secrecy, trickery and bending the law \u2014 have set off widespread protests. Underlying this winter of Russian discontent are deepening economic woes and a popular view that the government pours money into the glittering capital while squeezing the struggling hinterlands.\nIt was only by chance that residents of Urdoma, 700 miles northeast of Moscow, learned last year of an enormous landfill project nearby, when two local hunters stumbled onto workers felling lofty pine and birch trees to make way for it. The news galvanized Urdoma and dozens of other communities nestled among the forests of Arkhangelsk Province, and hardened attitudes toward the government.\n\u201cAll raw materials \u2014 oil, gas, diamonds, timber \u2014 it all comes from here and is sold abroad, while the profits go to Moscow,\u201d said Yuri Dezhin, a 41-year-old hunter living in a small trailer that protesters set up to monitor activity on the landfill site. \u201cWe get nothing.\u201d\nPolling shows that support for Mr. Putin is slipping, and for the first time in 13 years, a plurality of Russians think their country is moving in the wrong direction. Far removed from urban activists who protest government autocracy, public opinion has shifted most sharply in provincial areas, where Mr. Putin\u2019s popularity has stemmed from economic gains as much as from national pride.\nThe government has made changes that are deeply unpopular nationwide, like raising the retirement age and increasing sales taxes and utility fees. Inflation-adjusted incomes have dropped about 11 percent over five years; a move in January by Russian producers to sell nine eggs at the price of 10 generated a storm of mocking tweets.\nIn Urdoma, population 4,750, and other towns in the region, residents say that the governor has sold their idyll to garbage interests, and the government \u2014 all the way up to Mr. Putin\u2019s office \u2014 has rebuffed their quest for answers.\n\u201cThey try to brush us away like so many flies,\u201d said Lyudmila Marina, a retired head of the local administration.\nSo far, Mr. Putin has shown few signs that the disaffection worries him, but a continued decline in support could present a long-term problem for him. Term limits require that he surrender the presidency in 2024, and he would need popular support to push through any change to extend his rule.\nFor now, the question is how the disenchanted will channel their grievances, and what Mr. Putin will do about it.\nThe cost of joining public protests against the government can be high. In January, Anastasia Shevchenko, a human rights campaigner for the opposition group Open Russia, was arrested in Rostov-on-Don, in southern Russia, on charges of working for an \u201cundesirable organization.\u201d Her teenage daughter died within days from respiratory problems, with Ms. Shevchenko allowed to go to her child\u2019s bedside only at the last moment.\nProtesting about garbage is considered a safer alternative. Yet broader political discontent simmered through scores of demonstrations held across Russia this month against rising garbage collection fees and the absence of ecological recycling methods.\nA late January poll by the Levada Center, an independent Russian polling organization, showed that 45 percent of Russians thought the country was headed in the wrong direction, while 42 percent thought its course was correct, a sharp downturn from a year earlier.\nApproval of Mr. Putin\u2019s job performance stands at 64 percent, with disapproval at 34 percent. Any Western politician would love such numbers, but a year ago, the Russian leader had an 80 percent approval rating.\n\u201cThere is more displeasure expressed in the provinces, which were the foundation of Mr. Putin\u2019s support,\u201d said Lev D. Gudkov, director of the Levada Center.\nMr. Putin often boasts that Russia is thriving despite Western sanctions that followed its annexation of Crimea in 2014. But last month the government revised its gross domestic product figure in an attempt to show faster growth in 2018, and experts cried foul.\nSanctions and falling oil prices have taken a toll, while the government has spent heavily to modernize the military. Support has waned for the long, costly interventions in Syria and Ukraine that once lifted Mr. Putin\u2019s popularity.\n\u201cPeople are ready to be great, but they are not ready to pay for it from their own pockets,\u201d said Vladimir A. Ryzhkov, a history professor and opposition politician. \u201cFor the first time since Putin came to power 20 years ago, life is not improving, but getting worse.\u201d\nStill, while people want change, said Ekaterina Schulmann, a political scientist at Ranepa, a university for technocrats, they \u201care not going to storm the Kremlin.\u201d\nProtest votes lost the government four governor\u2019s races last fall, with similar defeats expected this year. Aleksei A. Navalny, Russia\u2019s most popular opposition politician, announced the formation of a national trade union to fight for decent wages for doctors, nurses, teachers and other professionals, an unfulfilled Putin promise.\nRussians are suffering from a \u201cdeep depression\u201d that promises to intensify even if it does not threaten Mr. Putin, wrote Mikhail Rostovsky, a columnist with the influential tabloid Moskovsky Komsomolets. \u201cA society that got used to such terms as \u2018Putin\u2019 and \u2018fat years\u2019 being interchangeable is suddenly facing a new, surprising reality.\u201d\nMembers of Clean Urdoma, the group spearheading efforts to ban trash imports to Arkhangelsk, note that despite Russia\u2019s immense natural riches and pockets of wealth, many of its people live in poverty.\n\u201cMoscow is the richest, most glittering city in Russia,\u201d said Sergei Yakimov, the group\u2019s lawyer. \u201cRather than spending money on recycling, they spend money on new pleasures and they want to send the garbage to the provinces.\u201d\nThe Arkhangelsk region, almost the size of France but with just 1.1 million people, would seem to have ample space for a massive landfill. The authorities settled on Shiyes, about 20 miles north of Urdoma, a former village with only a railroad maintenance station left.\nIgor Orlov, the governor of Arkhangelsk, extols the project as much-needed investment that will bring 500 jobs.\nA slick presentation developed by the City of Moscow said that the \u201ccommunal waste\u201d \u2014 it never mentions garbage \u2014 would be shaped into bales and wrapped in plastic, and that the landfill would be constructed to prevent pollutants from seeping out. It is designed to take 500,000 tons of garbage annually.\nBut residents cite many reasons to distrust such promises, notably the secretive, dishonest tactics that have accompanied the project from the start. It was rolled out with minimal public information and it remains unclear who is behind the project.\nSomeone produced an attack video called \u201cTraitors or Fools?\u201d that depicted anti-dump organizers as paid foreign agents.\nMr. Navalny and others have linked lucrative garbage contracts to senior bureaucrats, suggesting corruption.\nAfter complaints that a public hearing had not been held as required, residents of Urdoma awoke one day to discover scores of strangers bused into town. The outsiders entered an auditorium for a \u201chearing,\u201d while police officers barred residents from entering.\nThere has been no public environmental impact study, and residents fear that both the groundwater and the nearby Vychegda River will be polluted, spreading toxins as far as the Barents Sea.\nUnlike many Russian villages, Urdoma has a prosperous air, with newly built houses and a new school subsidized by Gazprom, Russia\u2019s state-run gas giant, which employs more than 530 local people. Residents argue that the village doesn\u2019t need more jobs.\nUrdoma is far removed from Moscow, more than 20 hours away by train. Gulag prisoners building the railroad first settled this area in the 1930s, essentially dumped in the woods and told to survive.\nThat ethos endures, with residents describing how they survive brutal winters feasting on mushrooms, berries and meat culled from the forest.\nIn the current economic environment, they expect even less from Moscow, and disparage it more. For many people, ignoring the capital is no longer an option.\nIn a speech in August, Nikolai Viktorov, the owner of a hardware business, uttered a line that became something of a rallying cry.\n\u201cAfter we get rid of the garbage in Shiyes,\u201d he said, \u201cwe will start getting rid of the garbage in Moscow.\u201d", "date": "Feb. 19, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/19/world/europe/russia-putin-landfill.html", "tags": "russians poor protesting feeling suffer \u201d garbage winter moscow russia blues government urdoma putin \u2014"}
