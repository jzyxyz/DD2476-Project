{"title": "Michael Cohen Accuses Trump of Expansive Pattern of Lies and CriminalityListen to \u2018The Daily\u2019: The Testimony of Michael Cohen", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s longtime lawyer and fixer accused him on Wednesday of an expansive pattern of lies and criminality, offering a damning portrayal of life inside the president\u2019s orbit where he said advisers sacrificed integrity for proximity to power.\nMichael D. Cohen, who represented Mr. Trump for a decade, laid out for Congress for the first time a series of deceptions by the president. He charged that Mr. Trump lied to the public about business interests in Russia, lied to reporters about stolen Democratic emails and told Mr. Cohen to lie about hush payments to cover up sexual misconduct.\nThe accusations, aired at a daylong hearing before the House Oversight and Reform Committee, exposed a dark underside of Mr. Trump\u2019s business and political worlds in the voice of one of the ultimate insiders. Perhaps no close associate has turned on a president in front of Congress in such dramatic fashion and with such high stakes since John Dean testified against President Richard M. Nixon during the Watergate scandal.\n\u201cHe is a racist. He is a con man. And he is a cheat,\u201d Mr. Cohen said of the president. Mr. Cohen, who has pleaded guilty to lying under oath to Congress, among other crimes, said he did so to protect Mr. Trump. \u201cI am not protecting Mr. Trump anymore,\u201d he said.\nWhile the details have been different, his portrait of the president broadly resembles those provided by others who have split with Mr. Trump, including former aides, business associates and even his onetime ghostwriter, who likewise have described a president who bullies, dissembles and cheats to serve his own interests.\n[Donald Trump \u201cinflated\u201d the value of his assets in documents given to Deutsche Bank, Michael Cohen testified.]\nBut it remained unclear whether Mr. Cohen\u2019s testimony would change the political dynamics of a series of scandals that have already polarized Washington and the country and that could lead to an impeachment battle this year. Representative Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland and the committee chairman, said afterward that Mr. Trump may have committed a crime while in office, but Republicans were unmoved.\nAssailing Mr. Cohen as a proven liar, they denounced the hearing as a \u201ccharade\u201d and an \u201cembarrassment for our country\u201d orchestrated by partisan Democrats seeking a pretext to try to remove Mr. Trump from office. Democrats said Republicans \u201cran away from the truth\u201d as they sought to defend a corrupt president who has employed \u201ctextbook mob tactics.\u201d\nThe hearing took place while the president was halfway around the world in Vietnam for a meeting with North Korea\u2019s leader. His family and advisers expressed anger at the timing, arguing that Democrats were undercutting Mr. Trump during sensitive nuclear diplomacy for political gain.\nAs with so many other moments of the Trump era, the hearing seemed to be as much about partisan theater as fact-finding. Democrats and Republicans set forth their conflicting narratives about the man who once served Mr. Trump, either as a duplicitous disgruntled former employee or a fallen sinner trying to redeem himself by coming clean.\nThrough it all sat Mr. Cohen, 52, with dark circles under his puffy eyes, already tired from eight hours of testimony behind closed doors the day before and awaiting a three-year prison term that begins this spring. Apologizing repeatedly to his family, Mr. Cohen portrayed himself as a broken man brought down by hubris, at one point choking up and wiping tears from his eyes at the mention of the effect on his daughter.\nThrough some five hours of nationally televised testimony, Mr. Cohen described his years working for Mr. Trump as a trip into a world of deceit in which the now-disbarred lawyer ignored his own conscience to get close to a magnetic person of power.\n\u201cSitting here today, it seems unbelievable that I was so mesmerized by Donald Trump that I was willing to do things for him that I knew were absolutely wrong,\u201d Mr. Cohen said. When he met Mr. Trump, he knew him as \u201ca real estate giant and an icon\u201d at the center of the action. \u201cBeing around Mr. Trump was intoxicating,\u201d he said.\nIn private business, Mr. Cohen said he rationalized Mr. Trump\u2019s dishonesty as \u201ctrivial,\u201d but as president, he said, \u201cI consider it significant and dangerous.\u201d\nThe president\u2019s re-election campaign organization dismissed Mr. Cohen on Wednesday as a convicted perjurer who should not be trusted. \u201cThis is the same Michael Cohen who has admitted that he lied to Congress previously,\u201d Kayleigh McEnany, the campaign\u2019s national press secretary, said in a statement. \u201cWhy did they even bother to swear him in this time?\u201d\nRepublicans on the committee aggressively challenged Mr. Cohen along the same lines. Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, the ranking Republican, called Mr. Cohen a \u201cfraudster, cheat, convicted felon and, in two months, a federal inmate.\u201d\nMr. Jordan questioned Mr. Cohen\u2019s motives in assailing Mr. Trump\u2019s character and actions, suggesting that the former lawyer was embittered because the new president did not bring him to Washington.\n\u201cYou wanted to work in the White House \u2014 \u201d Mr. Jordan said.\n\u201cNo, sir,\u201d Mr. Cohen replied.\n\u201c \u2014 and you didn\u2019t get brought to the dance.\u201d\n\u201cI did not want to go to the White House,\u201d Mr. Cohen asserted.\nEric Trump, one of the president\u2019s sons, took issue with that on Twitter. \u201cMichael was lobbying EVERYONE to be \u2018Chief of Staff,\u2019\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt was the biggest joke in the campaign and around the office. Did he just perjure himself again?\u201d\nThe hearing drew enormous interest on Capitol Hill, where Democrats last month took control of the House and are under pressure from their liberal base to take on Mr. Trump. The crowds were huge and the sense of drama palpable. Lawmakers of both parties listened raptly to Mr. Cohen\u2019s 30-minute opening statement.\nMr. Cohen laid out a series of actions by Mr. Trump that bolster previous accusations and news stories, presenting documents to corroborate his account, including copies of checks issued by the president or his trust that he said were reimbursements for $130,000 in hush payments Mr. Cohen made to Stormy Daniels, a pornographic film actress who alleged an affair with Mr. Trump.\nMr. Cohen said that Mr. Trump, as a candidate, initiated the hush payment plan and, while president, arranged for 11 checks reimbursing the lawyer \u201cas part of a criminal scheme to violate campaign finance laws,\u201d a crime to which Mr. Cohen has pleaded guilty.\nAfter news reports about the payments in February 2018, Mr. Cohen told lawmakers, the president called and told him to say that Mr. Trump \u201cwas not knowledgeable of these reimbursements and he wasn\u2019t knowledgeable of\u201d Mr. Cohen\u2019s actions. Mr. Trump himself later told reporters he did not know about it.\nMr. Trump\u2019s signature on a $35,000 check to Mr. Cohen, however, appeared to contradict that. Asked later by reporters if that meant Mr. Trump committed a crime while in office, Mr. Cummings said, \u201cBased on looking at the checks and listening to Mr. Cohen, it appears that he did.\u201d\nMr. Trump likewise did not report the debt to Mr. Cohen on his annual financial disclosure statement in 2017, but did report paying it off on his 2018 form.\nMr. Cohen told lawmakers that Mr. Trump personally monitored negotiations to build a Trump Tower in Moscow, asking about it \u201cat least a half-dozen times\u201d between January and June 2016, even while running for president.\n\u201cMr. Trump knew of and directed the Trump Moscow negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it,\u201d Mr. Cohen said. \u201cHe lied about it because he never expected to win. He also lied about it because he stood to make hundreds of millions of dollars on the Moscow real estate project.\u201d\nIn previous testimony before his prosecution, Mr. Cohen lied to Congress by saying negotiations ended in January 2016. Mr. Trump did not explicitly instruct him to lie to Congress, Mr. Cohen said, but through his actions, he \u201cmade clear to me\u201d that \u201che wanted me to lie,\u201d and the president\u2019s lawyers reviewed and even edited Mr. Cohen\u2019s false statement to Congress.\nMr. Cohen said he had no \u201cdirect evidence that Mr. Trump or his campaign colluded with Russia.\u201d But, he added, \u201cI have my suspicions.\u201d\nHe pointed to the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower in which Donald Trump Jr., the candidate\u2019s eldest son; Jared Kushner, his son-in-law; and Paul Manafort, the campaign chairman; met with visiting Russians after being told that they had \u201cdirt\u201d on Hillary Clinton from the Russian government.\nThe president has denied knowing about the meeting. But Mr. Cohen cast doubt on that, saying he was in Mr. Trump\u2019s office one day in June 2016 when Donald Jr. came in, went behind his father\u2019s desk and, speaking in a low voice, said, \u201cThe meeting is all set.\u201d The candidate, he said, replied, \u201cO.K., good. Let me know.\u201d\nMr. Cohen said that might have referred to the Russia meeting because \u201cMr. Trump had frequently told me and others that his son Don Jr. had the worst judgment of anyone in the world\u201d and that his son \u201cwould never set up any meeting of significance alone and certainly not without checking with his father.\u201d\nMr. Cohen also recalled being in Mr. Trump\u2019s office shortly before the Democratic National Convention in 2016 when Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime adviser, called. Mr. Trump put him on speaker phone and Mr. Stone reported that he had just spoken with Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, who said \u201cthat within a couple of days, there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.\u201d\nIn an interview last month with The New York Times, Mr. Trump denied speaking with Mr. Stone about WikiLeaks and the emails. Mr. Assange\u2019s lawyer issued a statement on Wednesday disputing Mr. Cohen\u2019s account.\nThe hearing left some questions unanswered, and Democrats pledged to press for more details about the Russia investigation when Mr. Cohen appears Thursday for a private interview with the House Intelligence Committee.\nMr. Cohen offered some tantalizing hints of more to come. Asked about his last conversation with Mr. Trump, he said he could not answer because it is \u201cbeing investigated right now\u201d by federal prosecutors in New York. Asked if he knew of other wrongdoing or crimes by Mr. Trump, he said: \u201cYes. And again, those are part of the investigation.\u201d\nMore generally, Mr. Cohen compared Mr. Trump to a mobster who inflated his net worth to the public while understating it to tax authorities, rigged an art auction using his charitable foundation and threatened those who got in his way.\nMr. Cohen estimated that Mr. Trump had asked him to threaten someone perhaps 500 times over 10 years, from berating a \u201cnasty reporter\u201d to warning of lawsuits. He provided letters he wrote during the campaign at Mr. Trump\u2019s direction to the president\u2019s high school, colleges and the College Board threatening civil and criminal action if they released his grades or SAT scores.\nMr. Trump did not run for president to make the country great, according to Mr. Cohen, instead calling his campaign the \u201cgreatest infomercial in political history\u201d for his business. \u201cHe never expected to win the primary,\u201d he said. \u201cHe never expected to win the general election. The campaign, for him, was always a marketing opportunity.\u201d But now, Mr. Cohen said, he fears that if Mr. Trump loses re-election next year, \u201cthere will never be a peaceful transition of power.\u201d\nThe former lawyer also described racist comments. Mr. Trump asked if he could \u201cname a country run by a black person that wasn\u2019t a shithole\u201d and, while driving through a struggling neighborhood, remarked that only African-Americans could live that way. \u201cHe told me that black people would never vote for him because they were too stupid,\u201d Mr. Cohen said.\nExcept for one Trump skeptic, Republicans did not ask about the president\u2019s conduct or, for that matter, offer any sustained defense of Mr. Trump. Instead, they pressed their argument that Mr. Cohen was not to be believed. They argued that he lied even in signing a committee form that did not disclose work for a bank in Kazakhstan.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a pathological liar,\u201d charged Representative Paul Gosar of Arizona.\n\u201cAre you referring to me or the president?\u201d Mr. Cohen retorted.\nMr. Cohen suggested Republicans were falling into the trap he did, trading their honor for a president who did not deserve it.\n\u201cI did the same thing that you\u2019re doing now for 10 years,\u201d he said. \u201cI protected Mr. Trump for 10 years.\u201d", "date": "Feb. 27, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/us/politics/michael-cohen-trump.html", "tags": "criminalitylisten \u2018 testimony expansive daily president lied pattern \u201d trump cohen lies told michael accuses campaign"}
