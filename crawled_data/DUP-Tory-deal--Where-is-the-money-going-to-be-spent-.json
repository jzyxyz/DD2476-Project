{"title": "DUP-Tory deal: Where is the money going to be spent?", "content": "Northern Ireland will receive an extra \u00a31bn over the next two years as part of the deal that will see the Democratic Unionist Party's 10 MPs back Theresa May's minority government in Commons votes.\nDUP leader Arlene Foster said the \"wide-ranging\" pact was \"good for Northern Ireland and the UK\" -  so where will the money be spent?\nThe heart of the financial package is infrastructure spending - \u00a3400m of it over two years. \nThat is a significant sum given that Northern Ireland's annual infrastructure budget is about \u00a31bn.\nThe deal specifically mentions the York Street Interchange, a project to ease congestion where three major roads meet in Belfast.\nIt is expected to cost about \u00a3150m, so there should be plenty left over for other major projects.\nThey could include a planned transport hub in the centre of Belfast and other major roads schemes like the completion of the A5 or A6.\nOn top of the \u00a3400m, there is a further \u00a3150m for ultra-fast broadband.\nThis was a project which was already being scoped by the Department of the Economy before the collapse of Stormont.\nIt is ultimately about improving the connectivity of rural businesses.\nPrevious Stormont/Westminster deals have also included infrastructure but they typically involved allowing Stormont to borrow more.\nThis time it is cold, hard, no-strings-attached cash.\nThe money for health and education is more modest - given that a figure of \u00a31bn for health alone was being mentioned during the negotiations.\nThere is a minimum of \u00a3250m for health and and we can assume it will get about half the \"immediate pressures\" money, bringing it to a total of \u00a3300m.\nThat will help ease the problems with waiting lists and give the system some breathing space ahead of a major reform programme.\nThe \"immediate pressures\" money for education (about \u00a350m) will go some way to easing a growing row with head teachers who have said they will not impose any more cuts.\nThere is also \u00a3100m to be spent on deprived communities over five years.\nIt will be interesting to see what the delivery mechanism for that money will be.\nStormont's Social Investment Fund, which was also designed to help those communities, has been mired in controversy. \nAnother part of this deal is to give flexibility to a previously agreed \u00a3500m fund for investment in shared education and housing projects.\nStormont has struggled to spend this money, in its first year just \u00a33m of a \u00a350m allocation was spent.\nSo its is possible that the new flexibility will allow all that money to go into general infrastructure spending.", "date": "26 June 2017", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-40402184", "tags": "also spent going infrastructure major northern money ireland years stormont deal dup-tory"}
