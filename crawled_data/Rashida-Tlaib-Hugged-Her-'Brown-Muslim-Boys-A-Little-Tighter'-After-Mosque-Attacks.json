Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) took to social media on Friday to respond to the recent shootings at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, that killed at least 49 people.\nThe congresswoman shared a photo of herself with her two sons, Adam and Yousif, in a Twitter post condemning white supremacy and violence. Tlaib and Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) became the first Muslim women ever elected to Congress in November.\n\u201cThis morning I hugged my two brown, Muslim boys a little tighter and longer,\u201d Tlaib, who is also the\u00a0first Palestinian-American woman to serve in Congress wrote on Friday.\n\u201cIt pains me to see the \u2018white supremacy\u2019 agenda right here at home sending signals across this world that a massacre like #NewZealandTerroristAttack is part of some kind of call to action. #TakeonHate,\u201d she continued.\u00a0\nThe man suspected of carrying out Friday\u2019s terrorist attack, apparently an\u00a0avowed white nationalist, purportedly wrote and published a manifesto espousing white supremacist, anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant views.\nThe alleged shooter, a 28-year-old Australian man identified as Brenton Harrison Tarrant, also reportedly claimed to idolize mass killings and extremist movements\u00a0across the world, including the U.S. He was arrested and charged with murder on Friday.\u00a0\nTlaib paid tribute to the victims of the Christchurch shootings,\u00a0at the Linwood and Al Noor mosques, in a series posts published on Twitter.\n\u201cWe are just told a number: 49 killed,\u201d she tweeted on Friday. \u201cI want to see their faces & know their stories.
