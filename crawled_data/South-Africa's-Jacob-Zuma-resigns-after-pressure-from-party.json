An era of one corruption allegation after another. An era of divisions, infighting and public squabbles. There are many people who are celebrating now, and not just from the opposition benches. \nSome of President Zuma's fiercest political foes came from his own ANC party. Comrades who fought white minority rule in the same trenches as he did, could not wait to see his back. He is gone now. \nThere is a renewed sense of hope as Cyril Ramaphosa is taking over the reins of Africa's most industrialised economy. Some will miss him though, pointing to achievements like announcing free fees for higher education. \nThe ANC's Jesse Duarte summed up the mood for many supporters of Mr Zuma's when she said \"this is a very painful moment\".\nThe ANC (African National Congress) issued a statement saying Mr Zuma's resignation provided \"certainty to the people of South Africa\".\nDeputy secretary general Jessie Duarte told reporters: \"President Zuma remains a principled member of the ANC. The ANC wants to salute the outstanding contribution he has made.\"\nMr Zuma, a former member of the ANC's military wing in the days of apartheid, rose through the ranks of the party to become president. He led the country for more than a third of its time after apartheid.\nBut he leaves office with several scandals hanging over him, and with South Africa's economy in dire straits.\nA meeting of the ANC's National Executive Committee had announced its decision to recall Mr Zuma on Tuesday and gave him until the end of Wednesday to resign.\nANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu then announced a parliamentary motion of no-confidence for Thursday, with Mr Ramaphosa sworn in as president as soon as possible after that.\nMr Zuma's resignation capped a day of fast-moving events.\nIt began with early morning police raids and arrests at the Johannesburg home of his close associates, the wealthy, Indian-born Gupta family.\nThe Guptas have been accused of using their close friendship with the president to wield enormous political influence. Both parties deny all allegations of wrongdoing.\nMr Zuma made no reference to the raid when he held a lengthy, unannounced, interview with national broadcaster SABC hours later.\nBut he said he had done nothing wrong and saw no reason to stand down.\nAs deputy president, as well as ANC leader, Mr Ramaphosa is likely to step in. The BBC's Andrew Harding says he is expected to be sworn in later on Thursday.\nBut it is possible that he would not seek to remain as president, preferring to get his own mandate at next year's presidential elections. \nThe ANC, as the party in government, would then nominate a candidate to serve until then, and parliament would take a vote within 30 days.\nMr Ramaphosa was already the overwhelming favourite to win the 2019 election, one which Mr Zuma was barred from competing in, having served two terms.", "date": "15 February 2018", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-43066443", "tags": "president party resigns zuma ramaphosa anc africa south pressure jacob decision"}
