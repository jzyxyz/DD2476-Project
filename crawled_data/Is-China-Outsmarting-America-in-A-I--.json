{"title": "Is China Outsmarting America in A.I.?", "content": "HONG KONG \u2014 S\u00f6ren Schwertfeger finished his postdoctorate research on autonomous robots in Germany, and seemed set to go to Europe or the United States, where artificial intelligence was pioneered and established.\nInstead, he went to China.\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have started a lab like mine elsewhere,\u201d Mr. Schwertfeger said.\nThe balance of power in technology is shifting. China, which for years watched enviously as the West invented the software and the chips powering today\u2019s digital age, has become a major player in artificial intelligence, what some think may be the most important technology of the future. Experts widely believe China is only a step behind the United States.\nChina\u2019s ambitions mingle the most far-out sci-fi ideas with the needs of an authoritarian state: Philip K. Dick meets George Orwell. There are plans to use it to predict crimes, lend money, track people on the country\u2019s ubiquitous closed-circuit cameras, alleviate traffic jams, create self-guided missiles and censor the internet.\nBeijing is backing its artificial intelligence push with vast sums of money. Having already spent billions on research programs, China is readying a new multibillion-dollar initiative to fund moonshot projects, start-ups and academic research, all with the aim of growing China\u2019s A.I. capabilities, according to two professors who consulted with the government on the plan.\nChina\u2019s private companies are pushing deeply into the field as well, though the line between government and private in China sometimes blurs. Baidu \u2014 often called the Google of China and a pioneer in artificial-intelligence-related fields, like speech recognition \u2014 this year opened a joint company-government laboratory partly run by academics who once worked on research into Chinese military robots.\nChina is spending more just as the United States cuts back. This past week, the Trump administration released a proposed budget that would slash funding for a variety of government agencies that have traditionally backed artificial intelligence research.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a race in the new generation of computing,\u201d said James Lewis, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cThe difference is that China seems to think it\u2019s a race and America doesn\u2019t.\u201d\nFor Mr. Schwertfeger, the money mattered. He received a grant six times larger than what he might have gotten in Europe or America. That enabled him to set up a full artificial intelligence lab, with an assistant, a technician and a group of Ph.D. students.\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible for assistant professors to get this much money,\u201d he said. \u201cThe research funding is shrinking in the U.S. and Europe. But it is definitely expanding in China.\u201d\nMr. Schwertfeger\u2019s lab, which is part of ShanghaiTech University, works on ways for machines, without any aid from humans, to avoid obstacles. Decked out with wheeled robots, drones and sensors, the lab works on ways for computers to make their own maps and to improve the performance of robots with tasks like finding objects \u2014 specifically, people \u2014 during search-and-rescue operations.\nMuch of China\u2019s artificial intelligence push is similarly peaceful. Still, its prowess and dedication have set off alarms within the United States\u2019 defense establishment. The Defense Department found that Chinese money has been pouring into American artificial intelligence companies \u2014 some of the same ones it had been looking to for future weapons systems.\nQuantifying China\u2019s spending push is difficult, because authorities there disclose little. But experts say it looks to be considerable. Numerous provinces and cities are spending billions on developing robotics, and a part of that funding is likely to go to artificial intelligence research. For example, the relatively unknown city of Xiangtan, in China\u2019s Hunan province, has pledged $2 billion toward developing robots and artificial intelligence. Other places have direct incentives for the A.I. industry. In Suzhou, leading artificial intelligence companies can get about $800,000 in subsidies for setting up shop locally, while Shenzhen, in southern China, is offering $1 million to support any A.I. project established there.\nOn a national level, China is working on a system to predict events like terrorist attacks or labor strikes based on possible precursors like labor strife. A paper funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China showed how facial recognition software can be simplified so that it can be more easily integrated with cameras across the country.\nChina is preparing a concerted nationwide push, according to the two professors who advised on the effort but declined to be identified, because the effort has not yet been made public. While the size wasn\u2019t clear, they said, it would most likely result in billions of dollars in spending.\nPresident Trump\u2019s proposed budget, meanwhile, would reduce the National Science Foundation\u2019s spending on so-called intelligent systems by 10 percent, to about $175 million. Research and development in other areas would also be cut, though the proposed budget does call for more spending on defense research and some supercomputing. The cuts would essentially shift more research and development to private American companies like Google and Facebook.\n\u201cThe previous administration was preparing for a future with artificial intelligence,\u201d said Subbarao Kambhampati, president of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial intelligence. \u201cThey were talking about increasing basic research for artificial intelligence. Instead of increases, we are now being significantly affected.\u201d\nChina\u2019s money won\u2019t necessarily translate into dominance. The government\u2019s top-down approach, closed-mouth bureaucracy and hoarding of information can hobble research. It threw a tremendous amount of resources toward curing severe acute respiratory syndrome, the deadly virus known as SARS, when it swept through the country 15 years ago. Yet the virus was eventually sequenced and tamed by a small Canadian lab, said Clay Shirky, a professor at N.Y.U. Shanghai and a technology writer.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that anyone was trying to stop the development of a SARS vaccine,\u201d Mr. Shirky said. \u201cIt\u2019s the habit that yes is more risky than no.\u201d\nAuthorities in China are now bringing top-down attention to fixing the problem of too much top-down control. While that may not sound promising, Wang Shengjin, a professor of electronic engineering at China\u2019s Tsinghua University, said he had noticed some improvement, such as professional groups sharing information, and authorities who are rolling back limits on professors claiming ownership of their discoveries for commercial purposes.\n\u201cThe lack of open sources and sharing of information, this has been the reality,\u201d Mr. Wang said. \u201cBut it has started to change.\u201d\nAt the moment, cooperation and exchanges in artificial intelligence between the United States and China are largely open, at least from the American side. Chinese and American scholars widely publish their findings in journals accessible to all, and researchers from China are major players in America\u2019s research institutions.\nChinese tech giants like Baidu, Tencent and Didi Chuxing have opened artificial intelligence labs in America, as have some Chinese start-ups. Over the past six years, Chinese investors helped finance 51 American artificial intelligence companies, contributing to the $700 million raised, according to the recent Pentagon report.\nIt\u2019s unclear how long the cooperation will continue. The Pentagon report urged more controls. And while there are government and private pushes out of China, it is difficult to tell which is which, as Baidu shows.\nBaidu is a leader in China\u2019s artificial intelligence efforts. It is working on driverless cars. It has turned an app that started as a visual dictionary \u2014 take a picture of an object, and your cellphone will tell you what it is \u2014 into a site that uses facial recognition to find missing people, a major problem in a country where child kidnapping has been persistent. In one stunning example, it helped a family find a child kidnapped 27 years earlier. DNA testing confirmed the family connection.\nBaidu\u2019s speech-recognition software \u2014 which can accomplish the difficult task of hearing tonal differences in Chinese dialects \u2014 is considered top of the class. When Microsoft announced last October that its speech recognition software had surpassed human-level language recognition, Baidu\u2019s head of research at the time playfully reminded the American company that his team had accomplished a similar feat a year earlier.\nIn an apparent effort to harness Baidu\u2019s breakthroughs, China said this year that it would open a lab that would cooperate with the company on A.I. research. The facility will be headed by two professors with long experience working for government programs designed to catch up to and replace foreign technology. Both professors also worked on a program called the Tsinghua Mobile Robot, according to multiple academic papers published on the topic. Research behind the robot, which in one award is described as a \u201cmilitary-use intelligent ground robot,\u201d was sponsored by funding to improve Chinese military capabilities.\nLi Wei, a professor involved in the Baidu cooperative effort, spent much of his career at Beihang University, one of China\u2019s seven schools of national defense.\nA company spokeswoman said: \u201cBaidu develops products and services that improve people\u2019s lives. Through its partnership with the A.I. research community, Baidu aims to make a complicated world simpler through technology.\u201d\nStill, there are advantages in China\u2019s developing cutting-edge A.I. on its own. National efforts are aided by access to enormous amounts of data held by Chinese companies and universities, the large number of Chinese engineers being trained on either side of the Pacific and from government backing, said Mr. Wang, of Tsinghua.\nDriving that attention is a breakthrough from an American company largely banned in China: Google. In March 2016, a Google artificial intelligence system, AlphaGo, beat a South Korean player at the complicated strategy game Go, which originated in China. This past week, AlphaGo beat the best player in the world, a Chinese national, at a tournament in Wuzhen, China.\nThe Google event changed the tenor of government discussions about funding, according to several Chinese professors.\n\u201cAfter AlphaGo came out and had such a big impact on the industry,\u201d said Zha Hongbin, a professor of machine learning at Peking University, \u201cthe content of government discussions got much wider and more concrete.\u201d Shortly afterward, the government created a new project on brain-inspired computing, he added.\nFor all the government support, advances in the field could ultimately backfire, Mr. Shirky said. Artificial intelligence may help China better censor the internet, a task that often blocks Chinese researchers from finding vital information. At the same time, better A.I. could make it easier for Chinese readers to translate articles and other information.\n\u201cThe fact is,\u201d Mr. Shirky said, \u201cunlike automobile engineering, artificial intelligence will lead to surprises. That will make the world considerably less predictable, and that\u2019s never been Beijing\u2019s favorite characteristic.\u201d", "date": "May 27, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/27/technology/china-us-ai-artificial-intelligence.html", "tags": "intelligence america china outsmarting \u201d chinese artificial government research a.i \u2014"}
