{"title": "U.S. Military\u2019s Global Edge Has Diminished, Strategy Review Finds", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Pentagon\u2019s new focus on threats from China and Russia after almost two decades of fighting terrorism \u201ctoo often rests on questionable assumptions and weak analysis,\u201d an independent bipartisan commission concluded in a sharply critical report issued on Wednesday that challenges President Trump\u2019s commitment to supporting a strong military.\nOver all, the panel that was appointed last year by Congress praised the general direction of the National Defense Strategy that was issued in January by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.\nBut it warned that projected budget shortfalls, overtaxed military forces around the globe and other risks were imperiling the plan, just as it was taking effect.\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s longstanding military advantages have diminished,\u201d according to the wide-ranging, 98-page report, an advance copy of which was made available to The New York Times. \u201cThe country\u2019s strategic margin for error has become distressingly small. Doubts about America\u2019s ability to deter and, if necessary, defeat opponents and honor its global commitments have proliferated.\u201d\nWhile the defense strategy \u201crepresents a constructive first step in responding to this crisis,\u201d the report found, \u201cit does not adequately explain how we should get there.\u201d\nThe National Defense Strategy represents a shift from fighting the insurgent wars of the last 17 years to large state-on-state conflicts. Mr. Trump has voiced a desire to end American involvement in the war in Afghanistan, and has chafed at keeping forces in Iraq and Syria.\nSpecifically, the strategy puts a higher priority on confronting China and Russia, as well as North Korea and Iran \u2014 a complex set of new and emerging threats.\nWednesday\u2019s report said China and Russia were seeking regional hegemony and pursuing aggressive military buildups aimed at neutralizing American strengths. Additionally, it said, threats posed by Iran and North Korea have worsened in recent years as both have developed more advanced weapons.\nThose rivals and others, the report found, are also increasingly engaged in what the military calls \u201cgray-zone conflicts\u201d \u2014 actions short of all-out war but that include diplomatic and economic coercion, media manipulation and cyberattacks, and the use of paramilitaries and proxy forces.\nThe commission also cited \u201cpolitical dysfunction\u201d in the United States, as well as reductions in military spending imposed by budget caps. The report said both have restrained the government from keeping pace with threats in what the panel called \u201ca crisis of national security.\u201d\nThe report\u2019s sober warnings come as Mr. Trump has ordered the Pentagon to cut 5 percent from its proposed 2020 fiscal year budget \u2014 to about $700 billion from roughly $733 billion. Representative Adam Smith, Democrat of Washington and most likely the next chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, has signaled that he favors even deeper cuts in military spending.\nA Pentagon spokesman, Johnny Michael, said the department welcomed the panel\u2019s report and would carefully consider its recommendations.\n\u201cThe commission\u2019s description of the complexity of the current security environment \u2014 in which strategic competition is occurring across domains and rapid technological developments are changing the character of warfare \u2014 is also a stark reminder of the gravity of these issues, and a call to action,\u201d Mr. Michael said in a statement.\nThe 12-member panel, formally known as the Commission on the National Defense Strategy for the United States, was created as part of the 2017 fiscal year defense budget to review the Pentagon\u2019s new plan even before Mr. Mattis released it. The panel is led by Eric S. Edelman, a former top Pentagon policy official in President George W. Bush\u2019s administration, and Adm. Gary Roughead, a former chief of naval operations.\nOver the past two decades, while the Pentagon mainly focused on counterterrorism and counterinsurgency, the report found that foreign adversaries were studying the American military. As a result, they developed ways to counter longstanding American advantages in projecting power over distances, air and missile defense, cyberoperations and electronic warfare.\n\u201cIn some cases, we are behind, or falling behind, in critical technologies,\u201d the report said. \u201cU.S. competitors are making enormous investments in hypersonic delivery vehicles, artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies.\u201d\nIn the event of large-scale conflict with Russia or China, the United States may not have enough remaining forces to deter other adversaries \u201cin one \u2014 let alone two \u2014 other theaters\u201d without having to rely on nuclear weapons, the report said.\n\u201cMany of the skills necessary to plan for and conduct military operations against capable adversaries \u2014 especially China and Russia \u2014 have atrophied,\u201d the report said.\nTo counter China in the western Pacific, the commission called for investing in more long-range military transport planes as well as submarines and other undersea warfare equipment. To counter Russia, the report recommended continuing a NATO buildup on the alliance\u2019s eastern flank and the Baltics that has been underway for several years.\nIt also warned against large troop reductions in the Middle East, where the United States\u2019 economic and security interests \u201cwill be profound.\u201d\nThe report applauded the Pentagon\u2019s strategy for aggressively pursuing technological innovations and fielding those advances with forces deployed around the world.\nHowever, it expressed concern \u201cthat America\u2019s edge is diminishing or has disappeared in many key technologies that underpin U.S. military superiority, and that current efforts to offset that decline are insufficient.\u201d\nThe report offered no specific suggestions about how much the military should spend to achieve these goals, other than to recommend an average budget increase of 3 percent to 5 percent above inflation.\n\u201cAvailable resources are clearly insufficient to fulfill the strategy\u2019s ambitious goals,\u201d it said, including assurances that the Pentagon \u201ccan defeat a major-power adversary while deterring other enemies simultaneously.\u201d\nAdditionally \u2014 and notably \u2014 commission members took the unusual step of warning that the voices of senior civilian officials in the Defense Department \u201chave been relatively muted\u201d on pivotal defense and national security policy.\nBy the end of the Obama administration, many senior Pentagon civilians were grumbling that the military\u2019s Joint Staff, reporting to Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was exercising too much influence over policy matters and subtly, though not deliberately, undermining the bedrock principle of civilian control of the armed forces.\n\u201cIt is critical that D.O.D. \u2014 and Congress \u2014 reverse the unhealthy trend in which decision-making is drifting away from civilian leaders on issues of national importance,\u201d the report said.\nIn a telephone interview, Mr. Edelman, a former top aide to Vice President Dick Cheney and a former United States ambassador to Turkey, said he and Admiral Roughead had met with Mr. Mattis in May to describe their conclusions, and that the secretary found them helpful.\nMr. Mattis could use the commission\u2019s report \u201cas a cudgel\u201d to prod the vast and often unwieldy Pentagon bureaucracy to respond to the panel\u2019s findings, Mr. Edelman said.\nOr, as the report put it, \u201cIf we do not square up to the challenge now, we will surely regret it.\u201d", "date": "Nov. 14, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/us/politics/defense-strategy-china-russia-.html", "tags": "finds commission defense military report pentagon diminished u.s. \u201d global edge strategy review \u2014"}
