{"title": "At The New Yorker, the Cartoonists Draw, but the Vision Is Hers", "content": "The New Yorker is known for its probing investigative reporting, deep-dive profiles and Pulitzer-winning criticism. But increasingly people are reading it for a few laughs.\nAs the magazine expands its internet presence, the amount of original humor it produces has grown, with comic essays and cartoons often making up about a third of its most popular articles online. In some ways, that\u2019s a return to the roots of the magazine, which began as a Jazz Age humor publication that championed James Thurber, Robert Benchley and Charles Addams, and helped define comedy for decades. \u201cWith The New Yorker,\u201d Russell Baker wrote, \u201cAmerican humor began to master the arts of understatement, to refine the crudities of old-fashioned burlesque into satire, to treasure subtlety and wit.\u201d\nAs the new cartoon editor of the magazine, Emma Allen, 29, has become a steward of this tradition. In an interview in her office at 1 World Trade Center, she said promoting the kind of refined wit the magazine has long been known for mattered less to her than publishing voices that are genuinely funny and representative of comedy today.\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel beholden to finding the next Benchley or a Benchley knockoff,\u201d she said. \u201cI like things that are witty. I also like dumb fart jokes. The high-low spread is much more interesting than trying to mummify a thing and keep presenting it all over and over again.\u201d\nIn May, Ms. Allen replaced the longtime cartoon editor, Robert Mankoff, who has moved  to Esquire, where he is its new humor editor. Mr. Mankoff was the star of a 2015 documentary, \u201cVery Semi-Serious,\u201d that showcased the magazine\u2019s process of sifting through 1,000 cartoons every week to settle on the 15 or so that make it into print. Every Tuesday, artists still come into the office to pitch their cartoons directly to the cartoon editor.\nWith an easy, self-deprecating laugh, Ms. Allen described her first exposure to running this system. (When editors at The New Yorker turn down a pitch for an article, they rarely do it face to face.) \u201cIt took me the first 10 people being, \u2018I\u2019m so sorry, I\u2019m so nervous,\u2019 and they were like, \u2018I\u2019m so sorry, I\u2019m so nervous,\u2019\u201d she said, with two weeks under her belt. \u201cThey were like: \u2018We\u2019re trying to sell you work.\u2019 And I was like: \u2018I\u2019m trying to sell myself.\u2019 I\u2019ve been buying them pastries, literally buttering them up.\u201d\nMs. Allen has a sprawling set of responsibilities: She also edits the daily cartoons for The New Yorker online; works on video and radio humor pieces for the magazine; runs its humor Twitter account; and for three years has edited Daily Shouts, comic essays that have become one of the most popular features on the site. (According to the magazine, in the past three months, traffic to those essays is up 60 percent from last year.)\nHer ability to find new voices for Daily Shouts is what first drew the attention of The New Yorker\u2019s editor, David Remnick. \u201cShe was bringing in people and things that I hadn\u2019t heard before, and sometimes you need to reinvigorate parts of the magazine,\u201d he said by phone, adding, \u201cWe need to have a deeper exploration of the web, as far as cartooning.\u201d\nMs. Allen, who grew up on the Upper West Side, has in some ways been preparing for this job her whole life. As a child, she cut out The New Yorker cartoons and filed them with \u201can archival drive\u201d matched only, she said, by her collection of photos of Leonardo DiCaprio. She attended Brearley School in Manhattan, where, she joked, her comic career was born. \u201cI went to an all-girls school for 13 years whose mascot is the beaver,\u201d she said. \u201cYou cannot come out at the other end of that without a sense of humor.\u201d\nAfter graduating from Yale \u2014 where her humor column masqueraded as an advice column for the school newspaper \u2014 she worked in media, often covering the art world. She wrote a funny feature for The New York Observer recapping the reality show \u201cWork of Art,\u201d and started at The New Yorker as an assistant to the articles editor Susan Morrison (who is currently working on a book about Lorne Michaels), occasionally writing, then editing Talk of the Town pieces.\nAfter taking over Daily Shouts, she brought in sharp young comedians like Megan Amram, one of the funniest voices on Twitter, and up-and-coming comic writers like Emma Rathbone (\u201cGLOW\u201d) and Hallie Cantor (\u201cLady Dynamite\u201d). And she pushed for more radio and video pieces.\nFinding new voices for cartoons may be more challenging, because there are so few outlets producing one-panel gags, but also because readers and artists have come to expect something very specific from The New Yorker cartoon, the gently observed comedy-of-manners-style that \u201cSeinfeld\u201d lampooned in an episode in which Elaine confronts an editor who can\u2019t explain the joke of a cartoon.\nWhen asked about how her tastes differ from her predecessor\u2019s, she said, \u201cI think I have a slightly weirder sense of humor.\u201d She added later, \u201cAs much as I like observational gags, I also like things that are more surreal.\u201d\nMs. Allen said that she hoped to expand the kinds of cartooning online, including trying more work with multiple panels and pairing joke writers with cartoonists on some projects. While she has had success finding traffic online, attracting more online readers she added that predicting what will do well is futile, pointing to a Daily Shouts piece by Amy Collier. \u201cIt\u2019s about a guy whose Tinder profile is him holding a fish,\u201d she said, shrugging. \u201cIt blew up.\u201d\nThe Trump administration has ushered in more political comedy at The New Yorker, as it has at many other news media outlets, and Ms. Allen said she worried that \u201can exhaustion\u201d could set in. While she said she has catholic taste, she does have pet peeves.\n\u201cI do think there\u2019s a type of regressive \u2014 that old wife \u2014 sitcom humor that persists somehow,\u201d she said, adding that they have a shorthand in the cartoon department when they see a joke like that. \u201cI\u2019ve never really watched \u2018Everybody Loves Raymond\u2019 but whenever there\u2019s a joke about a nagging wife or whatever, we\u2019re like, \u201cRaymond!\u201d Then she added: \u201cAnd I like Ray Romano.\u201d", "date": "July 2, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/02/books/new-yorker-cartoon-editor.html", "tags": "allen \u201d vision cartoonists editor yorker magazine new like draw humor"}
