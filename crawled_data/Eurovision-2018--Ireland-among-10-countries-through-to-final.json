The other four are Germany, Italy, Spain and France, while hosts Portugal also automatically qualified for the final.\nThe acts making it through the first semi-final were:\nIsrael's Netta is among the favourites for the main prize after competing in the first semi-final with her track Toy, which has a powerful message of female empowerment - and a quirky chicken dance.\nCyprus, another country widely-tipped to win the grand final, was represented by pop star Eleni Foureira, who brought the tropical and catchy beats of her track Fuego.\nBorn in Albania, Eleni first established herself as one third of Greek group Mystique in 2007.\nThe Czech Republic's Mikolas Josef has been touted as the nation's answer to Justin Bieber.
