{"title": "Wisconsin, Ground Zero for 2020 Politics, Looks Like a Tossup Again", "content": "MILWAUKEE \u2014 With their recent selection of Milwaukee for their party\u2019s 2020 convention, Democrats left little doubt that they believe their path to the White House runs through the Midwest in general and Wisconsin in particular.\nTheir optimism spiked in November, when Democrats defeated Scott Walker, the state\u2019s two-term conservative governor. And they were energized and optimistic again this week for an intensely politicized State Supreme Court election they hoped would show Wisconsin trending steadily blue.\nThen reality hit: A conservative judge, Brian Hagedorn, appeared to win a narrow, upset victory on Tuesday, underscoring instead how competitive Wisconsin politics remain.\nFor Democrats, an intense effort to rebuild their Midwestern \u201cblue wall\u201d for 2020 is showing gains in Michigan and Pennsylvania, both of which President Trump captured in 2016. On Tuesday, Democrats flipped a key Pennsylvania State Senate seat that Republicans had long held outside Pittsburgh.\n[Sign up for our politics newsletter and join our conversation about the 2020 presidential race.]\nBut in Wisconsin, the apparent loss of the State Supreme Court race \u2014 Judge Hagedorn leads by nearly 6,000 votes and a recount is possible \u2014 underscored what strategists in both parties said in interviews this week: The state is a tossup in 2020 and its political identity is very much in flux.\n\u201cRepublicans know they need this state and are going to fight like hell to keep it in President Trump\u2019s column,\u201d said Joe Zepecki, a Democratic strategist in Wisconsin. He said that Mr. Walker\u2019s loss in November may have fired up the conservative base just as Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 loss did for Democrats last November.\n\u201cThey\u2019re coming with everything they\u2019ve got,\u201d he said of Republicans. \u201cThat means we have work to do.\u201d\nWisconsin\u2019s reputation as a battleground state is well earned. In the three closest presidential elections of recent times \u2014 2000, 2004 and 2016 \u2014 Wisconsin was decided by the narrowest average margin of any other state: less than one percentage point in each election.\nMr. Walker lost his re-election bid for governor by less than one percentage point, after warning all year of a coming blue wave. Over the weekend, Mr. Walker offered a pep talk to Republican activists in Milwaukee about the stakes in electing Judge Hagedorn, a former lead counsel to his administration, who defended contentious election issues such as a voter ID law.\n[Check out our tracker of the 2020 Democratic candidate field.]\nDemocrats wanted to defeat Judge Hagedorn and gain a liberal Supreme Court majority, Mr. Walker warned, so they could seize control of redistricting after 2020 and \u201cget rid of one, maybe two seats that we currently have in the House of Representatives.\u201d\nDemocrats \u201chaven\u2019t forgotten about how close the election was\u201d in 2016, Mr. Walker told party activists gathered for breakfast at the American Serb Hall in Milwaukee. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to make that mistake again.\u201d\nMark Jefferson, executive director of the Wisconsin Republican Party, said Judge Hagedorn\u2019s apparent victory showed the power of the party\u2019s engaged conservative base.\n\u201cThe grass roots took offense to the attacks on Hagedorn\u2019s Christian faith,\u201d he said, referring to news accounts that the judge founded a Christian school that allows firing teachers in same-sex relationships.\nBut others say Mr. Walker\u2019s midterm loss is probably a more relevant bellwether for 2020 than the Supreme Court race, because turnout was more than twice as high, and Mr. Walker is a polarizing, partisan figure in Wisconsin, much like the president.\nBarry White, a lawyer who voted for Mr. Walker in 2010 but snubbed him in 2018 in favor of his Democratic opponent, Tony Evers, said he had wanted to make a bigger point. His ballot was \u201ca repudiation of Trump and Republicans that insist on carrying his water,\u201d Mr. White said. \u201cIt was the only message I could send.\u201d\nMr. White lives in the Milwaukee suburbs, the state\u2019s most populous Republican region. Mr. Evers\u2019s gains there last year were a key to his narrow victory. In an interview, Mr. Walker said that should be a lesson to Mr. Trump. \u201cTo win, he\u2019s going to have to improve his numbers in the suburbs,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the passion the opposition is going to have, he\u2019s going to have to make some inroads.\u201d\nLast fall, Mr. Walker matched his vote totals from 2014 in the three suburban counties outside Milwaukee. But a surge of Democratic votes in the demographically changing suburbs meant his vote share dropped in 2018 by 12 percentage points in Waukesha County and by 16 points in Ozaukee County.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the paradox of Trump\u2019s strategy of appealing to his base constantly,\u201d said Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School Poll of the state. \u201cIt also helps gin up the feelings of your opposition. I think that it\u2019s a gift to Democrats that keeps on giving.\u201d\nOne of those voters is Tiffany Duncan, a 26-year-old employee of a printing company, who skipped the 2016 election because she didn\u2019t like either major party candidate. But she definitely plans to vote in 2020 \u2014 for whichever Democrat takes on Mr. Trump. \u201cI didn\u2019t think Trump was this crazy,\u201d she said as she walked to Caf\u00e9 Bavaria in Wauwatosa Village.\nStill, Mr. Franklin said, the state is so evenly divided, its chances of determining an Electoral College majority for either party \u201cputs us at ground zero.\u201d\nIn a Marquette poll in January, 49 percent of Wisconsin voters said they would definitely vote for someone other than Mr. Trump. Only 27 percent plan to definitely support the president, meaning his path to a second victory in the state is both uphill and narrow.\nMany of today\u2019s uncertain voters \u2014 who are Republicans or Republican-leaning independents \u2014 may come home to the party, especially once there is a Democratic nominee to contrast with the president.\nJohn Carlson, a 59-year-old engineer in Milwaukee, is one of those gettable voters for both parties. He went for Mr. Trump in 2016 but is uncertain if he will do so again. Democrats could win him over, he said \u2014 \u201cif the Democrats came up with somebody reasonable, which I\u2019m not expecting them to do.\u201d\nRepublicans are framing the Milwaukee convention as an opportunity to motivate their own base, expecting Democrats to showcase a parade of far-left figures and policies. National Republicans have already begun a coordinated effort to paint Democrats as wild-eyed radicals steering the country toward socialism.\n\u201cDemocrats were energized in 2018, like any party is out of power during the first midterm, but then decided to go off the rails once they seized control of the House,\u201d said Rick Wiley, a former political director of the Republican National Committee, whose roots are in Wisconsin.\n\u201cThe president energizes base Republicans and has had great success with working class voters,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cThose same working class voters won\u2019t check the box on a progressive/socialist nominee.\u201d\nMr. Jefferson of the Wisconsin Republican Party said he was upbeat about Mr. Trump despite public polling.\n\u201cI expect to see the same thing this cycle as 2016, where all polling suggests it\u2019s an uphill battle and on Election Day things look a lot different,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the Democrats are once again overplaying their hand and a little too confident.\u201d\nWhen Mr. Trump holds rallies aimed at Wisconsinites, he visits media markets across northern and western regions, largely agricultural and rural, where in 2016 he outperformed earlier Republican nominees.\nIn the Supreme Court race, Judge Hagedorn, the conservative, got a major boost in the Green Bay and Wausau markets, enough to overcome a deep deficit in Dane County, which includes Madison, the state\u2019s bluest stronghold.\nIn the 18 counties in the Green Bay media market, where TV ads linked Judge Hagedorn to Mr. Trump, voters swung by 18 points toward the conservative compared with a State Supreme Court election last year won by a liberal judge, according to an analysis by Craig Gilbert of The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\nThe Saturday before Election Day, there was no shortage of avid Trump supporters at Roar Off the Shore, a tasting of craft beers and cheeses east of Green Bay in Kewaunee County, which is on the thumb of the Wisconsin mitten.\nThough the county\u2019s populace is small, Mr. Trump\u2019s ability to run up the score in such places was repeated all across rural America in 2016. He won Kewaunee County, a dairy region, by 28 points compared with Mitt Romney\u2019s six-point margin as the 2012 Republican nominee.\n\u201cI\u2019m tired of politicians; he\u2019s not a politician,\u201d said Randy Boor, 57, who works in a factory that makes commercial cookware. He judged Mr. Trump\u2019s chances of carrying the state in 2020 as even better than in 2016.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a guy there that\u2019s delivering,\u201d he said. \u201cHe wants to do the frickin\u2019 job. You know how much could get done if he wasn\u2019t being opposed by all these idiots?\u201d\nAnother beer taster, Dave Soborowicz, a 47-year-old plumber, had driven across the state from Eau Claire to attend the event with his brother, who wore a Trump hat. But Mr. Soborowicz was less enamored of the president and unsure if he would vote for him the next time. \u201cHe\u2019s so bloated in his head that he thinks he\u2019s still going to get his frickin\u2019 wall, when he\u2019s been defeated,\u201d he said.\nMr. Soborowicz said business was good for him as a plumber but he wasn\u2019t ready to give Republicans and the president credit. \u201cAll I know is it was a bad winter,\u201d he said, \u201cso we were very busy.\u201d", "date": "April 4, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/us/politics/wisconsin-2020.html", "tags": "zero like tossup ground democrats looks wisconsin \u201d state walker politics milwaukee said"}
