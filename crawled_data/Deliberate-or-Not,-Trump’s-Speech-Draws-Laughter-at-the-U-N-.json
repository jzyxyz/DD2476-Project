{"title": "Deliberate or Not, Trump\u2019s Speech Draws Laughter at the U.N.", "content": "UNITED NATIONS \u2014 They laughed.\nNot even a minute into the speech. They laughed.\nOn the planet\u2019s biggest stage, with more than 100 world leaders gathered with their ministers, ambassadors and dignitaries of every stripe, while news cameras from as many countries broadcast the speech in as many languages, they laughed.\nPresident Trump seemed surprised when he heard it. Attendees of the United Nations General Assembly, normally a scripted annual gathering of presidents, prime ministers and wizened diplomats, do not typically break decorum, let alone laugh at the most powerful man in the room.\n[The president doubled down on his \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy.]\nBut there it was, soon after Mr. Trump commenced his highly anticipated speech on Tuesday, as he bragged about how much his administration had accomplished in two years, \u201cmore than almost any administration in the history of our country.\u201d\nFor Mr. Trump it was little more than a minor boast, a well-worn line trotted out frequently at rallies with ardent supporters across America that rarely warrants special mention anymore. But for some reason, at the United Nations on Tuesday, it resonated.\nBy the end of the day, there was no escaping it. The laughter eclipsed Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism of the \u201ccorrupt dictatorship\u201d in Iran and the \u201chuman tragedy\u201d in Venezuela. As a news story it held its own alongside the sentencing of Bill Cosby and the continuing battle over Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s Supreme Court nomination. The laugh even made it into the official White House transcript of Mr. Trump\u2019s speech.\nMr. Trump put a brave face on things, saying later that in a speech concerned mostly with berating enemies and allies alike, the line about his administration\u2019s extraordinary productivity had been \u201cmeant to get some laughter.\u201d\nAt a news conference on Wednesday, he again defended himself.\n\u201cThey weren\u2019t laughing at me \u2014 they were laughing with me,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters. \u201cWe had fun.\u201d\nIf true, it is a change for Mr. Trump, who has spent much of his career trying to get the laughter \u2014 real or perceived \u2014 to stop.\n\u201cWe need a President who isn\u2019t a laughingstock to the entire World,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted about President Obama in 2014.\nBefore the 2016 election, he complained that Mexico was \u201claughing at our dumb immigration laws,\u201d Vladimir V. Putin was \u201claughing at Obama\u201d over the leak of classified NSA documents, and the world was laughing \u201cat what fools our leaders have been\u201d on trade.\nThe laughter was supposed to have stopped when Mr. Trump took the presidency.\n\u201cThe world respects our country now,\u201d he told a local television journalist in North Dakota on the sidelines of a rally there this month, calling his performance superior to that of Mr. Obama. \u201cThey didn\u2019t respect our country when he was running it. They were laughing at our country.\u201d\nBut the world, it seems, is still laughing.", "date": "Sept. 25, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/25/world/trump-nations-laughter.html", "tags": "mr. world u.n laughter speech draws laughing united \u201d trump deliberate \u2014"}
