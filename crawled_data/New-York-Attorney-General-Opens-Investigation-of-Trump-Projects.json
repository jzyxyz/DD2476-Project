{"title": "New York Attorney General Opens Investigation of Trump Projects", "content": "[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]\nThe New York attorney general\u2019s office late on Monday issued subpoenas to Deutsche Bank and Investors Bank for records relating to the financing of four major Trump Organization projects and a failed effort to buy the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League in 2014, according to a person briefed on the subpoenas.\nThe inquiry opens a new front in the scrutiny of Deutsche Bank, one of the few lenders willing to do business with Donald J. Trump in recent years. The bank is already the subject of two congressional investigations and was examined last year by New York banking regulators, who took no action.\nThe new inquiry, by the office of the attorney general, Letitia James, was prompted by the congressional testimony last month of Michael D. Cohen, President Trump\u2019s former lawyer and fixer, the person briefed on the subpoenas said. Mr. Cohen testified under oath that Mr. Trump had inflated his assets in financial statements, and Mr. Cohen provided copies of statements he said had been submitted to Deutsche Bank.\nThe inquiry by Ms. James\u2019s office is a civil investigation, not a criminal one, although its focus and scope were unclear. The attorney general has broad authority under state law to investigate fraud and can fine \u2014 or in extreme cases, go to court to try to dissolve \u2014 a business that is found to have engaged in repeated illegality.\nThe request to Deutsche Bank sought loan applications, mortgages, lines of credit and other financing transactions in connection with the Trump International Hotel in Washington; the Trump National Doral outside Miami; and the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago, the person said.\nInvestigators also requested records connected to an unsuccessful effort to buy the Bills, the person said. Mr. Trump gave Deutsche Bank bare-bones personal financial statements in 2014 when he planned to make a bid for the team, The New York Times has reported. The deal fell through when the team was sold to a rival bidder for $1.4 billion.\nMr. Trump worked with a small United States-based unit of Deutsche Bank that serves ultra-wealthy people. The unit lent Mr. Trump more than $100 million in 2012 to pay for the Doral golf resort and $170 million in 2015 to transform the Old Post Office Building in Washington into a luxury hotel.\nNew Jersey-based Investors Bank was subpoenaed for records relating to Trump Park Avenue, a project it had backed.\nA spokeswoman for Deutsche Bank said on Tuesday that it had received the subpoena.\nInvestors Bank declined to comment. The Trump Organization did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe subpoenas are a culmination of months of threats from Ms. James that she would aggressively investigate Mr. Trump. In August, referring to the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into Russian interference in the 2016 election, she said \u201cthe president of the United States has to worry about three things: Mueller, Cohen, and Tish James.\u201d\nIn her victory speech on the night she was elected in November, she said, \u201cI will be shining a bright light into every dark corner of his real estate dealings, and every dealing, demanding truthfulness at every turn.\u201d The next month, before taking office, she told NBC that \u201cwe will use every area of the law to investigate President Trump and his business transactions and that of his family.\u201d\nMr. Trump has a rich recent history of grievances against the New York attorney general\u2019s office. Before former Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman resigned amid allegations of assault and abuse against women, he pursued cases against the Trump Foundation and Trump University. Mr. Trump has referred to him as \u201csleazebag AG Eric Schneiderman\u201d and \u201cShady Eric.\u201d He also assailed Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s temporary successor, Barbara D. Underwood, and has referred to Ms. James as \u201cyet another AG\u201d who \u201copenly campaigned on a GET TRUMP agenda.\u201d\n\u201cWill never be treated fairly by these people \u2014 a total double standard of \u2018justice,\u2019\u201d he added on Twitter.\nIn Congress, the House Intelligence Committee has been exploring real estate transactions related to Russia and other foreign interests, including Deutsche Bank loans to the Trump Organization.", "date": "March 11, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/11/nyregion/deutsche-bank-trump.html", "tags": "general office opens york investigation bank trump projects deutsche \u201d new attorney"}
