{"title": "Are Budget Airlines Really Worth It? ", "content": "When the budget airline Wow Air abruptly ceased operations earlier this year, thousands of travelers were left stranded and scrambling, on both sides of the Atlantic, to make alternate travel plans.\nThe news, after months of speculation that the Icelandic airline was struggling financially, came at a period that has already been particularly difficult for low-cost carriers. Cyprus\u2019s Cobalt Air, Pakistan\u2019s Shaheen Air, and Primera, based in Denmark and Latvia, collapsed in October. In February, Flybmi and Germania filed for bankruptcy. For most, rising fuel costs and overexpansion led to their demise. \nBudget airlines are appealing to travelers because they offer much lower prices than major airlines. A flight to London from New York can cost around $1,000 on American Airlines, British Airways or another major carrier, but the same trip on low-cost Norwegian, for the same dates, can be around $600. Similarly, a flight from Washington to Paris costs around $1,200 on Air France, and just over $800 on Aer Lingus. \nFor travelers who are concerned about the risks of booking low-cost, here are some tips to keep in mind. \nThough the Wow Air developments were jarring, aviation experts say that the chances of an airline going under, out of nowhere, are very low.\nTo protect your travel and itineraries, first conduct some research online. News about Wow Airlines\u2019 financial woes had been swirling for months before it canceled its flights. A Google search brings up articles from 2018 mentioning that Wow was \u201cstruggling,\u201d suffering from \u201cgrowing pains\u201d and on Trip Advisor, the company had more \u201cTerrible\u201d reviews than \u201cGood\u201d or \u201cExcellent\u201d ones. \nChristian Nielsen, the chief legal officer at AirHelp, a site that helps passengers make claims against airlines, recommends travelers consider whether the carrier is well-established. \n\u201cIf it\u2019s someone new in the game, I would be cautious about booking a flight across the Atlantic,\u201d he said. \u201cAt least not without buying some travel insurance.\u201d\nScott Keyes, co-founder and chief executive of Scott\u2019s Cheap Flights, a travel site that alerts members on inexpensive flight fares, said he would always read news reports on specific airlines. (Scott\u2019s Cheap Flights never suggested flights on Wow Air, because of the airline\u2019s high fees for luggage, food, seat upgrades and other additions.) \n\u201cIf I heard that an airline was potentially going to go under soon, I wouldn\u2019t book it,\u201d said Mr. Keyes. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t recommend booking if it seems like this is something that\u2019s imminent but I wouldn\u2019t be shying away from booking budget airlines altogether.\u201d\nAnd if things do go awry?\n\u201cThere are protections if things go wrong, so there\u2019s very little downside risk to booking flights on low-budget airlines,\u201d Mr. Keyes said. \nIf your airline goes bankrupt, it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll receive a refund for a canceled flight. But your credit-card company could help, and you can file a dispute with them for a service you paid for, but did not receive.\n\u201cA lot of cards nowadays have protections that say \u2018if your trip is canceled for reasons unrelated to anything you did, then we will reimburse you\u2019,\u201d said Mr. Keyes. This protection is quite common, he said, comes with most cards, not simply the premium ones. \u201cIt\u2019s also not something you need to pay to enroll in.\u201d\nDebit cards, however, do not offer this cancellation protection, said Zaneilia Harris, president of Harris and Harris Wealth Management in Upper Marlboro, Md. \nMs. Harris suggested applying for the Chase Sapphire Preferred card and Citi\u2019s Advantage Executive World Elite Mastercard. She added that travelers should make sure they \u201cread the fine print to learn what is a covered event and what information is required to support a claim.\u201d\nMr. Nielsen noted that credit card terms can be difficult and frustrating to read through, but taking the time is worth it. \u201cAnd you can always give your credit card company a call to make sure you\u2019ve got the right to a refund,\u201d he said. \nIf you have any nonrefundable expenses at stake, insurance is a good idea. Buying travel insurance is trip-specific and often relies on how much risk you\u2019re willing to take. If you are concerned about the limitations of an airline\u2019s compensation terms, you can book travel insurance from a third party and look for coverage for your entire trip, not just your plane tickets. \n\u201cTravel insurance from a third party can help if your airline goes belly up, bags are lost or stolen, your flight is delayed \u2014 for a covered reason \u2014 or you miss a connection that prevents you from, say, boarding your cruise,\u201d said Julie Loffredi, media relations manager for InsureMyTrip, a travel insurance comparison site.\nAnd if you\u2019re traveling internationally, travel medical insurance is a good idea. Experts recommend \u201ccancel for any reason\u201d travel insurance plans because you can get at least 75 percent of your nonrefundable trip costs back.\n\u201cWhen you purchase a trip insurance plan to protect the money you spent for your trip, it\u2019s important to know what your total nonrefundable trip cost is,\u201d said Justin Tysdal, CEO of Seven Corners Inc, a travel insurance provider. \u201cThat\u2019s the amount you want to insure. Take a moment to consider if that dollar amount is material to you. What if you had to cancel your trip, and you had to absorb that loss? If the trip expenses are a material amount to you, you\u2019ll want to buy trip insurance.\u201d \nOf course, some developments arise that no amount of planning can account for, especially when you\u2019re traveling. If your airline suddenly cancels flights, your first calls should be to your travel agent or insurance company, then to your credit card company. And if you didn\u2019t book with an agent or if you don\u2019t have insurance, first try to get a new flight and then contact your credit card company. \n\u201cTry to get a flight ticket home as quickly as possible, because you\u2019re probably not the only one stranded and there will be high demand,\u201d Mr. Nielsen said. \u201cThe sooner you reach out to the right people, the quicker they can book you on an alternate flight and get you home.\u201d\n52 PLACES AND MUCH, MUCH MORE Follow our 52 Places traveler, Sebastian Modak, on Instagram as he travels the world, and discover more Travel coverage by following us on Twitter and Facebook.
