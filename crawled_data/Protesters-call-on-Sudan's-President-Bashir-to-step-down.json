{"title": "Protesters call on Sudan's President Bashir to step down", "content": "Hundreds of protesters have gathered in the Sudanese city of Omdurman to call for an end to the nearly 30-year rule of President Omar al-Bashir.\nThe BBC's Mohamed Osman says security forces have used tear gas against some of the 300 or so demonstrators there.\nSudan has already been rocked by two weeks of sometimes deadly street demonstrations prompted by a rise in the cost of living. \nThe anti-government protests first erupted in mid-December over inflation.\nThe price of bread had tripled in some places and fuel costs have also risen.\nThe protests in Omdurman, close to the capital Khartoum, began after Friday prayers. \nPeople were heard chanting: \"Freedom, peace, and justice. Revolution is the people's choice.\"\nMany of those taking part came straight from the Al Syiad Abderhaman mosque, which is linked to the opposition Umma party.\nDemonstrations began on 19 December after the government announced price rises for fuel and bread.\nThe protests have escalated into broader calls for an end to the rule of President Bashir, who came to power after a coup in 1989. Activists accuse him of mismanaging the economy.\nOver the past year, the cost of some goods has more than doubled, while the Sudanese pound has plunged in value.\nThree-quarters of Sudan's oil wealth has been lost after the country's southern half voted to secede in 2011, leading to the formation of South Sudan.\nIts economy has also been strained by over 20 years of US sanctions, which were lifted in October 2017. The US had introduced economic sanctions after accusing Sudan of sponsoring terrorist groups.\nMr Bashir's regime has been accused of widespread human rights abuses.\nIn 2009 and 2010, the International Criminal Court (ICC) charged him with several counts of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity, and a warrant was issued for his arrest.", "date": "4 January 2019", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-46761119", "tags": "call protests bashir omdurman end president step demonstrations protesters rule cost price sudan sudanese"}
