{"title": "NCAA Will Pull More Events From North Carolina Unless HB2 Is Repealed, Sports Group Warns", "content": "North Carolina could lose NCAA sporting events for the next six years if its legislature fails to repeal a controversial anti-LGBTQ law passed last year, sports officials in the state warned in a letter to lawmakers on Monday.\nThe law in question \u2015 known as HB2 \u2015 barred cities and localities from enacting laws to protect people from discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity and required that students at North Carolina schools use bathrooms that match their gender assignment at birth, rather than their gender identity.\nThe law has already cost the state dearly: Last year, the NBA moved the 2017 All-Star Game out of Charlotte, while the NCAA and Atlantic Coast Conference relocated sporting events out of the state.\nThe failure to repeal HB2 could compound those losses in the coming days, according to the North Carolina Sports Association, a nonprofit organization whose\u00a0\u201cpurpose is to grow, promote and enhance the general welfare of the sports industry in North Carolina.\u201d\nThe NCAA, the state association said in a Monday letter addressed to North Carolina lawmakers, is currently evaluating bids for future postseason events. The letter states that the NCAA has told the association that \u201cdue to their stance on HB2, all North Carolina bids will be pulled from the review process and removed from consideration.\u201d\nFurther, the letter warns, the NCAA could pull any postseason events scheduled for 2017-2018 from the state. (The NCAA\u2019s original decision only affected the current academic year.) North Carolina cities and schools, the letter says, have submitted a total of 133 bids to host various NCAA sporting events between now and 2022.\n\u201cNorth Carolina is on the brink of losing all NCAA Championship events for six consecutive years,\u201d the letter states. \u201cOur window to act is closing rapidly. ... Our last chance to save these events is now.\u201d\nThe letter was signed by Scott Dupree, the executive director of the Greater Raleigh Sports Alliance and a member of the North Carolina Sports Association.\n\u201cI wrote the letter as a member of the North Carolina Sports Association, and with the approval of its board of directors, in order to provide our legislators in the General Assembly with the most up-to-date information in regard to the NCAA\u2019s ongoing bid process, which is winding down,\u201d Dupree said in an email statement. \u201cI wanted to make sure our legislators were aware of the timeline and the potential economic losses for our state, and thus the urgency of the situation.\u201d\nGov. Roy Cooper\u2019s (D) victory in November\u2019s election\u00a0seemed to signal the end of HB2, and the state legislature considered repealing it during a December special session. But a compromise between Democrats and Republicans fell apart, leaving the law on the books.\nNBA Commissioner Adam Silver has expressed a desire to bring the All-Star Game back to Charlotte, but the league has said it will not do so as long as HB2 remains law.\u00a0\nThe NCAA moved seven total events from North Carolina \u2015 including men\u2019s NCAA Tournament games and Division I championships for women\u2019s soccer, women\u2019s lacrosse and women\u2019s golf \u2015 in September. The ACC relocated its 2016 football championship from Charlotte to Orlando, Florida, and also moved the upcoming women\u2019s basketball conference tournament out of the state.\n\u201cThe NCAA decided in September to remove championships from North Carolina for the 2016-17 season, and it has not yet determined future championship sites,\u201d an NCAA spokesperson said in an email Monday, in response to questions about whether it had decided not to award events to North Carolina unless HB2 was repealed. \u201cThe NCAA expects to announce site selections for the 2018-19 through 2021-22 championship seasons in April.\u201d\nThe NCAA last year required cities interested in hosting future events to \u201cspecifically outline how they will protect participants and spectators from discrimination.\u201d\nDuke men\u2019s basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski has condemned the law as \u201cembarrassing.\u201d University of North Carolina head coach Roy Williams slammed the law on Sunday after UNC\u2019s win in Greensboro, which was scheduled to host 2017 NCAA Tournament games this March before the NCAA moved them.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad we were able to take a game here because of that stupid rule that we have in our state that took a lot of great opportunities for people in our state, and great athletes that like to do things in our state,\u201d Williams said Sunday. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t say rule, I guess it\u2019s a law. A law\u2019s more important than a rule, I guess. But I just think that\u2019s ridiculous, and what it\u2019s doing to our state and the reputation of our state.\u201d\nThis post has been updated with comment from the NCAA.", "date": "\n02/06/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ncaa-north-carolina-hb2_n_5898a36fe4b0c1284f270dbe", "tags": "letter warns repealed \u201d events carolina sports group unless ncaa state north pull law"}
