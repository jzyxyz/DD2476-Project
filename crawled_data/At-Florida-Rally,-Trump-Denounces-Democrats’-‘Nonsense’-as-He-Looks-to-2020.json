{"title": "At Florida Rally, Trump Denounces Democrats\u2019 \u2018Nonsense\u2019 as He Looks to 2020", "content": "PANAMA CITY BEACH, Fla. \u2014 President Trump on Wednesday brought his amped-up roadshow to this spring break playground on the Florida gulf coast, demanding that Democrats stop the \u201cnonsense\u201d of investigating him, mocking Democratic presidential candidates like Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg, and joking about staying in the White House for another decade.\n\u201cAfter two years, nothing \u2014 no collusion,\u201d Mr. Trump told a crowd of several thousand supporters. \u201cNow the Democrats are saying, \u2018We want more.\u2019\u201d The congressional investigations of his ties to Russia and the subpoenas of administration officials, he said, were a disgrace.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to stop this nonsense,\u201d the president said.\nDrawing out investigations after the release of the special counsel\u2019s report, Mr. Trump said, was the only way Democrats could hope to beat him in the 2020 election.\nThe president seemed to relish the coming campaign, describing the Democratic primary race as a likely \u201cchoice between Sleepy Joe and Crazy Bernie,\u201d referring to Mr. Biden, the former vice president, and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. And Mr. Trump took aim at Mr. Buttigieg, a rising star in the early days of the campaign, drawing out the pronunciation of his name (\u201cBoot-edge-edge\u201d) and predicting that Mr. Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Ind., would be a poor match for the president of China, Xi Jinping.\n\u201cBy the way, you see the tariffs we\u2019re doing?\u201d Mr. Trump said, abruptly changing the subject to his suddenly stalled trade negotiations with China. \u201cBecause they broke the deal.\u201d\nThe president cycled through a familiar list of rally topics, like a border wall with Mexico and the support of Democrats for late-term abortions. But it was a discursive performance, even by Mr. Trump\u2019s standards, and the mood was notably less electric than at some of his other rallies. The crowd began straggling out during the latter half of the speech, to the sound of helicopter engines being warmed up in a nearby field.\nMr. Trump twice complained about the stage \u2014 where he stood under a giant banner that read \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d \u2014 saying that the floor was so slippery that he wondered if it had been set up by the Democrats.\nThe setting, an amphitheater bathed in the Coppertone glow of a setting sun, seemed more fitting for a gathering of Jimmy Buffett\u2019s Parrotheads than a rally of Mr. Trump\u2019s red-baseball-cap-wearing legions. When the president riffed on familiar themes like the \u201cfake news media\u201d and Hillary Clinton, the crowd responded with the same dependable whoops as the Parrotheads when Mr. Buffett segues into \u201cMargaritaville.\u201d\n\u201cIn six years, they\u2019re all going to be out of business, folks,\u201d Mr. Trump said of the news media. \u201cIf we want to drive them crazy, I\u2019ll say in 10 years. They\u2019ll go crazy. \u2018See, he is a despot. He is a despot.\u2019\u201d\nFor Mr. Trump, the rally was a return to a beach resort he toured in October after Hurricane Michael, a Category 5 storm that left a path of wanton destruction, ripping roofs from houses, splintering trees, scattering tractor-trailers and twisting giant hangars at the nearby Tyndall Air Force Base.\nThe president promised to send more disaster aid, including $448 million from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. And he took a swipe at Puerto Rico for being ungrateful to him despite receiving what he claimed falsely was $91 billion in disaster aid after Hurricane Maria.\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting your money, one way or the other,\u201d Mr. Trump declared.\nPanama City Beach and Panama City next door have struggled to recover, with some residents still living in temporary housing seven months after the storm. Officials there are deeply frustrated by the sluggish pace of federal disaster funding, which has been tied up in a dispute between the White House and congressional Democrats over Mr. Trump\u2019s refusal to send more disaster aid to hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico.\n\u201cThis funding has to be shook loose,\u201d said Mayor Greg Brudnicki of Panama City, a Democrat, who traveled to Washington recently to lobby lawmakers. \u201cI\u2019m tired of it being tied to other issues \u2014 partisan politics, Puerto Rico, whatever. We\u2019re north of 200 days since the storm without getting what we need.\u201d\nFew blame Mr. Trump himself: Panama City and the surrounding Bay County is resoundingly Trump Country. But Mr. Brudnicki said he hoped the president would come with more than comforting words. The mayor is seeking millions to repair the Air Force base, which accounts for about a third of the city\u2019s economic activity.\nMr. Trump responded to two of his pleas, saying that the federal government would increase its share of the burden of rebuilding to 90 percent, from 75 percent, as it has for other areas recovering from major natural disasters. And the president\u2019s promise of additional emergency funds from HUD will help the mayor ease the city\u2019s housing shortage.\n\u201cThe people here love Trump, there\u2019s no doubt about it,\u201d Mr. Brudnicki said. \u201cThey believe he\u2019s trying to do everything he can. But people are holding us hostage from the other side of the aisle on certain issues.\u201d\nSigns of Bay County\u2019s affection for the president, but also the desperation of its storm-tossed residents, abounded during his tour there in the fall. On the wall of a ruined storefront that sat on the route of his motorcade, someone had spray-painted \u201cUncle Trump\u201d and \u201cHelp Us \u2014 Trump.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, the road from Panama City\u2019s airport to the beach was lined with signs beseeching Mr. Trump to rebuild Tyndall Air Force Base. With the Air Force mulling whether to consolidate its widely dispersed fleet of fighter jets at other bases, Tyndall\u2019s survival has been uncertain.\nWhen Mr. Trump landed at the base, he took a 15-minute tour of the damage, driving past buildings that still had boarded-up windows and battered facades. The motorcade stopped in front of a hangar with a badly damaged roof, where he stepped out to take credit for keeping the base open.\n\u201cThey were going to close the base, and I said, \u2018No,\u2019\u201d the president said, flanked by Florida lawmakers, including the state\u2019s Republican senators, Marco Rubio and Rick Scott. \u201cNow we\u2019re rebuilding.\u201d\nAt the rally, Mr. Trump took note of the tensions between him and Mr. Rubio during the 2016 campaign, but noted that he had thrown his support behind one of the senator\u2019s favorite causes: removing President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in Venezuela. The president suggested that he was carefully watching the fitful effort to oust Mr. Maduro.\n\u201cHow we doing in Venezuela?\u201d Mr. Trump asked Mr. Rubio. \u201cStep by step.\u201d", "date": "May 8, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/us/politics/trump-rally.html", "tags": "\u2018 nonsense \u201c democrats denounces looks city panama trump rally florida \u2014 said"}
