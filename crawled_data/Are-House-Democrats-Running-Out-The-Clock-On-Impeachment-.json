{"title": "Are House Democrats Running Out The Clock On Impeachment-", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2015 Despite the evidence of obstruction of justice outlined in the Mueller report, House Democrats are showing very little interest in impeaching President Donald Trump, managing calls to remove him from office with promises for more investigation.\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has repeatedly said Trump is \u201cnot worth it\u201d and that impeachment is \u201ctoo good\u201d for the president \u2015 lines she repeated Thursday during a closed-door meeting with House Democrats. But at this point, the put-downs seem more like a backhanded way of dismissing impeachment than a serious sentiment.\nPelosi has absolutely set the tone for Democrats in Congress to continue calling for more oversight instead of running with the evidence already laid out in special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report that suggests Trump has committed multiple crimes.\nThe speaker has been emphatic that Democrats are taking a magnifying glass rather than a blind eye to the information in the Mueller report, insisting that committees will continue investigating and if that leads to impeachment, \u201cso be it.\u201d\nBut the practical effect of more investigations \u2015 particularly if they don\u2019t yield anything more damning than what\u2019s in the Mueller report \u2015 could be sending voters the message that Mueller\u2019s findings weren\u2019t sufficient to impeach Trump. And it could set the stage for Congress to run out the clock and defer to voters to remove him from office.\nAnd that\u2019s how many House Democrats seem to want to deal with Trump.\n\u201cI support her view that, in terms of impeachment, the case must be compelling, the evidence should be overwhelming, and the sentiment around impeachment should be bipartisan in nature,\u201d Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) told reporters Thursday afternoon. \u201cThat\u2019s the clear standard she has set forth, and that\u2019s the one that is the operating principle upon which we are proceeding.\u201d\nAsked if that meant he didn\u2019t think the evidence was already clear that Trump obstructed justice, Jeffries said Democrats were \u201cstill in the process of gathering and collecting information.\u201d He noted that he would like to see the unredacted version of the Mueller report, the underlying documents used in the investigation, and for Mueller to testify.\nAll of those efforts may be worthwhile, and they could lead to more explosive discoveries. But they also may lead to nothing \u2015 and they could delay a reckoning with the facts already laid out in the Mueller report. Pressed whether Democrats would just be, in effect, running out the clock on impeachment, Jeffries suggested any thought of impeachment was premature.\n\u201cWho\u2019s running out the clock on impeachment when we haven\u2019t even said we\u2019re considering impeachment?\u201d he asked.\nOther Democrats on Thursday were happy to endorse Pelosi\u2019s slow-walk too.\nRep. Dan Kildee (D-Mich.) was an enthusiastic supporter of Pelosi\u2019s calls for more investigations, and he thought the Democrats supporting impeachment now weren\u2019t using every tool available to them.\n\u201cWhen some members just immediately default to impeachment, as if that sort of solves the problem, I don\u2019t think it does \u2015 and I don\u2019t think she thinks it does,\u201d Kildee said of Pelosi.\nThe No. 4 Democrat in the House, Assistant Speaker Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n of New Mexico, said there were several things Democrats should be doing to deal with Trump. \u201cConstitutional oversight responsibilities, investigating, making sure we are presenting the facts to the American people, and seeing where those facts lead us here in the halls of Congress,\u201d he said.\nLike Pelosi did Thursday, Luj\u00e1n quickly pivoted to Attorney General Bill Barr lying to Congress. \nThey are referring to Barr\u2019s appearance before a House panel on April 9 in the weeks after the attorney general released his four-page summary of the Mueller report to Congress. At the hearing, Rep. Charlie Crist (D-Fla.) asked Barr about a\u00a0New York Times report that said Mueller and his team didn\u2019t believe Barr\u2019s summary accurately reflected the special counsel\u2019s findings. Barr said he didn\u2019t know what the news reports were referencing,\u00a0even though we now know\u00a0Mueller had sent Barr a letter a week earlier expressing concern that Barr\u2019s summary hadn\u2019t accurately captured the report.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a crime,\u201d Pelosi said.\nBy going after Barr\u2019s false statement, however, Pelosi largely avoided any further comment on Trump\u2019s potential crimes.\nThe never-ending cycle of scandals has been a staple of Trump\u2019s presidency and campaign. With a constant flow of new crises, Democrats have little interest in litigating anything beyond a day or two.\nThis week, Democrats were dealing with an attorney general who misled the public and a White House that appears content to defy any document request or subpoena it wants.\nHouse Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) said Trump blocking Congress from interviewing administration personnel and disregarding document requests was a \u201ccritical moment in this nation\u2019s history.\u201d\n\u201cWe cannot, we simply cannot, have a presidency that is run as if it were a king or dictator,\u201d he said.\nCummings has not specified how he\u2019ll try to enforce his subpoenas. The usual strategy is to sue in federal court, where judges are sympathetic to Congress, but proceedings can take forever. Cummings told HuffPost he is wary of running out of time, which is one reason he\u2019s also considering the more exotic option of using the congressional \u201cinherent contempt\u201d power to fine or jail uncooperative officials.\nEither way, the administration seems unintimidated so far by press releases and hectoring tweets.\n\u201cWhen the president said he could go down the street in New York and shoot somebody and it wouldn\u2019t bring him any harm? He\u2019s absolutely right at the rate we\u2019re going,\u201d Cummings said.\nMeanwhile, Democrats still talk about working with Trump. Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) met with the president this week to discuss a massive $2 trillion infrastructure bill. And Democrats are also hopeful they can get some legislation to Trump\u2019s desk addressing drug prices.\nWhen HuffPost asked moderate Democrat Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.) about impeachment on Thursday, he said the things his constituents were worried about were tax policy, the environment and infrastructure.\nThat isn\u2019t necessarily a universal experience for Democrats. House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth (D-Ky.) told reporters Thursday that impeachment was absolutely at the forefront of his constituents\u2019 minds.\n\u201cIn my district, I haven\u2019t had anybody talk to me about pocketbook issues,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only thing I get is people saying, \u2018We got to get rid of him.\u2019\u201d\nObviously some Democrats do believe there\u2019s already enough evidence to impeach. \nRep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) \u2015 who famously told a liberal group on her first day in office that they were going to \u201cimpeach the motherfucker\u201d \u2015 told HuffPost on Thursday that more investigations were fine, but they ought to be done under the \u201cumbrella\u201d of impeachment.\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t do it in that formal way, then we\u2019re not really putting this administration on notice,\u201d Tlaib said.\nFor the time being, that appears to be the position of a small minority of Democrats. The most common refrain ever since the Mueller report was released has been for more investigations. And with the Senate in Republican control, Democrats seem to worry that trying to impeach Trump \u2015 and failing to remove him \u2015 would embolden the GOP and help his reelection chances.\nRep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), a former professor of constitutional law at American University, told HuffPost on Thursday that there is a legal component and a political component to impeachment.\n\u201cThe legal component is whether high crimes and misdemeanors were committed against the character of our democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe political component is \u2015 it\u2019s political because it\u2019s vested in Congress, not in the courts. And the question is whether the cost of allowing a corrupt and lawless president to stay in office are higher than the costs of removing him. That\u2019s what makes it a political judgment.\u201d", "date": "\n05/02/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-impeachment-nancy-pelosi-running-clock_n_5ccb5617e4b0548b73575a27", "tags": "report democrats impeachment- \u201d house \u2015 pelosi impeachment running mueller clock"}
