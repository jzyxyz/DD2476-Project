It\u00a0was part of the articles of impeachment against presidents Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon.\nHere is a rundown of the 10 episodes of potential obstruction mentioned in the Mueller report:\nIn December 2016, during the transition, Michael Flynn, who would become national security adviser, had two calls with then-Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in which they discussed newly imposed U.S. sanctions on Russia. Flynn later lied to administration officials and the FBI about the calls, which got him fired from the White House and later resulted in him pleading guilty to lying to investigators. \nOn Jan. 27, 2017, Trump had a private dinner with then-FBI Director James Comey in which he asked for Comey\u2019s loyalty. In a private conversation the next day, Trump told Comey, \u201cI hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go,\u201d according to Mueller\u2019s redacted report.\nTrump later instructed K.T. McFarland, then the deputy national security adviser,\u00a0 to contact Flynn, \u201ctelling him the President felt bad for him and that he should stay strong,\u201d the report states. Mueller\u2019s redacted report discusses whether Trump\u2019s actions amount to obstruction of justice but does not make a definitive pronouncement.\nThen-Attorney General\u00a0Jeff Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation in early 2017 after reports that he had twice met with Ambassador Kislyak in 2016. Sessions\u2019 recusal infuriated Trump, who privately asked the attorney general to reverse his decision. After Comey confirmed the existence of the Russia investigation in March 2017, the redacted report states Trump \u201ccontacted Comey and other intelligence agency leaders and asked them to push back publicly\u201d on suggestions the president was connected to Russian meddling.\nThe special counsel found that \u201cthe evidence does not establish that the President asked or directed intelligence agency leaders to stop or interfere with the FBI\u2019s Russia investigation\u201d in this specific case. But the redacted report states the incident helps illuminate Trump\u2019s motivations behind other actions with regard to the investigation and notes that he \u201ccomplained to advisors that if people thought Russia helped him with the election, it would detract from what he had accomplished.\u201d\nTrump fired Comey on May 9, 2017, and \u201cacknowledged that he intended to fire Comey regardless of the DOJ recommendation and was thinking of the Russia investigation when he made the decision,\u201d according to the redacted report. Trump was angered that Comey had not publicly stated that Trump wasn\u2019t under investigation and worried the investigation would limit what he could do while in office.\u00a0\n\u201cI just fired the head of the F.B.I.,\u201d Trump told Russia\u2019s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov after Comey\u2019s firing, according to the report. \u201cHe was crazy, a real nut job. I faced great pressure because of Russia. That\u2019s taken off ..... I\u2019m not under investigation.\u201d \nThere is evidence that Trump\u2019s firing of Comey was an attempt to \u201cprotect himself from an investigation into his campaign,\u201d according to the redacted report. But it also states that \u201cthe evidence does not establish that the termination of Comey was designed to cover up a\u00a0conspiracy between the Trump Campaign and Russia.\u201d\nAfter special counsel Robert Mueller took his post in May 2017, Trump fumed to senior advisers that Mueller had conflicts of interest but was told that his criticisms had no grounds and were \u201cridiculous.\u201d Nevertheless, Trump twice called White House Counsel Don McGahn to tell him that he wanted Mueller removed due to those perceived conflicts of interest \u2015 the latter time more forcefully directing McGahn to tell Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to fire him.\u00a0\n\u201cMcGahn recalled the President telling him \u2018Mueller has to go\u2019 and \u2018Call me back when you do it.\u2019 \u2026 McGahn understood the President to be saying that the Special Counsel had to be removed by Rosenstein,\u201d the redacted report states.\u00a0\nMcGahn decided that he would not carry out the president\u2019s order and instead informed White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus that he intended to resign, telling Priebus \u201cthat the President had asked him to \u2018do crazy shit.\u2019\u201d Although McGahn ultimately did not resign and Trump did not follow up with him again, the redacted report discusses whether or not Trump\u2019s actions were attempts to obstruct justice.\nDays after Trump told McGahn to remove Mueller, he called former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski into the Oval Office for a private meeting. In the meeting, Trump dictated a speech for Sessions to give and then instructed Lewandowski to give it to the then-attorney general. \nTrump wanted Sessions to state that Trump had been treated unfairly and that the special counsel\u2019s investigation would be limited only to Russian interference in future elections rather than looking into past conduct. Trump\u2019s speech for Sessions also featured the line \u201c[Trump] didn\u2019t do anything wrong except he ran the greatest campaign in American history,\u201d according to the report.\nMueller\u2019s redacted report discusses whether Trump\u2019s attempt to curtail the probe constituted obstruction of justice, in one section finding that there is \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d the president\u2019s attempt \u201cwas intended to prevent further investigative scrutiny of the President\u2019s and his campaign\u2019s conduct.\u201d\nTrump made numerous attempts to prevent emails surrounding a June 9, 2016, meeting between his son Donald Trump Jr., son-in-law Jared Kushner and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya from becoming public. The meeting stemmed from music promoter Rob Goldstone telling Trump Jr. that he could connect the campaign with Russian nationals who could offer dirt on Democratic rival Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, to which Trump Jr. responded: \u201cif it\u2019s what you say I love it.\u201d\nPresident Trump directed aides to \u201cnot publicly disclose the emails,\u201d according to the redacted report, and also directed his son\u2019s false statement to The New York Times that claimed the meeting was about adoptions. Although there is a lot of evidence that Trump tried to block information about the meeting from the public and press, the special counsel notes that \u201cthe evidence does not establish that the President took steps to prevent the emails or other information about the June 9 meeting from being provided to Congress or the Special Counsel.\u201d\nTrump continued to be furious at Sessions for his recusal from the Mueller probe and at some point called him at home to ask that he reverse his decision, according to Sessions. The president said he wanted Sessions to take back his recusal so that he could direct the attorney general to investigate and prosecute Hillary Clinton. Trump repeatedly and publicly criticized Sessions for recusing himself over the following months.\nTrump floated possible replacements for Sessions when talking with staff and brought up that a new attorney general would directly oversee the special counsel. \n\u201cThere is evidence that at least one purpose of the President\u2019s conduct toward Sessions was to have Sessions assume control over the Russia investigation and supervise it in a way that would restrict its scope,\u201d the redacted report states.\nAfter The New York Times reported on Jan. 25, 2018, that Trump had told McGahn to get rid of Mueller, Trump tried to get McGahn to deny that the incident ever took place. Trump first instructed aides to relay the message to McGahn, but after the White House counsel refused to lie about the conversation, Trump held a meeting with him in the Oval Office where the president insisted that McGahn deny he was ever told to fire Mueller. McGahn still refused, and Trump additionally asked why McGahn had told the special counsel\u2019s office about the incident.\nThe redacted report presents evidence of Trump\u2019s repeated attempts to get McGahn to change his story and states there is \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d that the president tried to influence McGahn\u2019s account \u201cin order to deflect or prevent further scrutiny of the President\u2019s conduct towards the investigation.\u201d \nTrump\u2019s actions toward the special counsel\u2019s witnesses is another point of possible obstruction, with the redacted report looking at his conduct concerning Flynn, former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and a third individual whose name is redacted \u2015 possibly longtime adviser Roger Stone.\u00a0\nWhile the special counsel was prosecuting Manafort, Trump repeatedly stated that his former campaign chair was being treated unfairly and floated the possibility of a pardon. Both Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani publicly defended Manafort and talked about presidential pardon power. Trump engaged in similar actions with regard to Flynn, and his personal counsel left a voicemail on Flynn\u2019s lawyer\u2019s answering machine asking for \u201csome kind of heads up\u201d if \u201cyou\u2019ve gone on to make a deal with ... the government.\u201d\nThe special counsel\u2019s analysis mentions that Trump\u2019s actions had the potential to sway Manafort, Flynn and jury members in their prosecution. This was especially the case with Manafort, the special counsel argues.\n\u201cEvidence concerning the President\u2019s conduct towards Manafort indicates that the President intended to encourage Manafort to not cooperate with the government,\u201d the redacted report states.\nTrump\u2019s former personal lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen began cooperating with the special counsel\u2019s office in July 2018 and told investigators that the president had repeatedly lied about the extent of a proposed Trump Tower project in Moscow. Cohen also admitted to falsely telling Congress that he briefed Trump on the project only three times, in an attempt to distance the president from Russia. \nAfter the FBI raided Cohen\u2019s home and office in April 2018 in relation to the special counsel\u2019s investigation, Cohen says he began discussing pardons with the president\u2019s personal counsel \u201cand believed that if he stayed on message, he would get a pardon or the President would do \u2018something else\u2019 to make the investigation end,\u201d the redacted report states. The president also tweeted that Cohen would not \u201cflip\u201d after the raid. \nThe Mueller investigation looked at whether Trump aided or participated in Cohen\u2019s false statements to Congress and whether Trump tried to prevent Cohen from being truthful with the government. The special counsel found \u201cthe evidence available to us does not establish that the President directed or aided Cohen\u2019s false testimony,\u201d even if there is evidence that the president knew Cohen was lying. Regarding the president\u2019s positive backing of Cohen before turning on him and calling him a \u201crat,\u201d the special counsel\u2019s office found that there is evidence to infer that Trump wanted Cohen to not cooperate with prosecutors and then sought to discredit him once he began aiding the investigation.", "date": "\n04/18/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mueller-obstruction-barr-report-trump_n_5cb8dbf5e4b06605e3eca857", "tags": "redacted see obstructed \u201c report investigation investigated president counsel justice events trump special mueller"}
