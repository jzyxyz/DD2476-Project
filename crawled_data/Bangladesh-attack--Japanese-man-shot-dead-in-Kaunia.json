An investigation is under way.\nThe killing of the Italian man, Cesare Tavella, prompted the US and UK to warn its citizens to be cautious.\nAttacks on foreigners in Bangladesh are rare, correspondents say, but Islamist violence has surged recently, including high-profile attacks on atheist bloggers.", "date": "3 October 2015", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-34432697", "tags": "shot italian kaunia japanese bangladesh man killing dead attack hoshi attacks"}
