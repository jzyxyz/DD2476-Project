The decision neutralizes what was likely the last serious effort to cripple the law through the courts and represents a major victory for President Barack Obama.\nA decision against the health care law would have put the Republicans eyeing the presidency in a bind by forcing them to spell out what they proposed to do for millions of Americans without crucial subsidies.
