{"title": "Trump, Kim Fail To Reach Agreement In Hanoi After Talks Abruptly Collapse", "content": "President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un failed to reach a nuclear agreement during their second summit, which was abruptly cut short in Hanoi, Vietnam on Thursday afternoon.\nSpeaking to reporters following his negotiations with Kim, Trump said there were two sticking points that had made a deal \u201cinappropriate\u201d at this time. Kim wanted sanctions to be \u201clifted in their entirety and we wouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d the president said.\nTrump added that while Kim had offered to \u201cdenuke a large area that we wanted,\u201d including the Yongbyon site, the North Korean leader was not willing to meet U.S. demands to dismantle a number of other nuclear facilities, including a second uranium enrichment site.\n\u201cYou always have to be prepared to walk,\u201d Trump said, referring to the stalled talks. \u201cI could\u2019ve 100 percent signed something today. We had papers ready to sign \u2026 I\u2019d much rather do it right than do it fast.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s remarks followed an unexpected change in the summit\u2019s schedule. The two leaders had planned to have a working lunch before partaking in a joint signing ceremony at around 2 p.m. local time. But the White House announced around midday that both events would be canceled. A scheduled press conference with Trump was pushed up by about two hours.\nAppearing alongside Trump at the press conference, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the U.S. and North Korea had made \u201creal progress\u201d in Hanoi despite the breakdown in negotiations. Pompeo added that the two sides were attempting to unravel an \u201cincredibly difficult problem\u201d and said negotiations would continue \u201cin the weeks ahead.\u201d\nWhen asked whether Pyongyang would be willing to give up all their nuclear weapons, Trump refused to comment \u2014 saying only that Kim\u2019s vision did not \u201cnot exactly\u201d align with Washington\u2019s.\nTrump said, however, that the North Korean leader had promised to maintain a moratorium on the testing of nuclear weapons and missiles.\n\u201cI trust him. I take him at his word,\u201d the president said of Kim.\u00a0\nTrump said no plans had been made for the two leaders to meet again, though he stressed the summit had ended amicably.\nIt was a \u201cvery friendly\u201d parting, the president said, noting that he and the North Korean leader share a \u201cwarmth\u201d which he hopes will continue.\n\u201cI want to keep the relationship,\u201d Trump said.\nAlthough analysts had warned that Trump and Kim\u2019s second meeting could conclude without a substantial agreement \u2014 much like their first in Singapore \u2015 there had initially been talk of the U.S. opening diplomatic channels with Pyongyang or even declaring an end to the Korean War.\nEarlier on Thursday, Kim stressed that he remained open to denuclearization, although the North has never committed to a definition of what that would entail. In December, the country\u2019s state-run news agency said Pyongyang would not rid itself of nuclear weapons unless the United States dismantled its own nuclear network, which could reach the Korean peninsula.\nHowever, Kim insisted that denuclearization was still on the table, hence his appearance in Vietnam.\n\u201cIf I\u2019m not willing to do that, I wouldn\u2019t be here right now,\u201d Kim said.\nWhen a Washington Post reporter asked Kim about a potential deal, he said he remained optimistic about the ultimate outcome of the summit.\n\u201cFrom what I feel right now, I do have a feeling that good results will come,\u201d Kim said.\u00a0\nIn the lead-up to the summit, Trump downplayed any demands the U.S. would impose upon the North. The move stood in sharp\u00a0contrast with the harsh rhetoric Trump used before his summit with Kim in Singapore last year, after which he trumpeted that Pyongyang would denuclearize and ultimately rid itself of its nuclear arsenal.\nThe president played down those commitments once again on Wednesday before a one-on-one dinner with Kim.\n\u201cWe had a very successful first summit. I felt it was very successful, and some people would like to see it go quicker,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI\u2019m satisfied; you\u2019re satisfied. We want to be happy with what we\u2019re doing. But I thought the first summit was a great success. And I think this one, hopefully, will be equal or greater than the first.\u201d\nPompeo has struggled to meet any of the expectations set in Singapore, and diplomatic efforts appeared to stall at the end of last year. The U.S. and North Korea will still have to agree on what, exactly, \u201ccomplete denuclearization\u201d means for Kim. Experts have said the only acceptable pathway forward would include outside weapons inspectors.\u00a0\nReacting to the \u201cno deal\u201d on Thursday, Vipin Narang, a professor of international relations at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the Hanoi summit\u2019s outcome was \u201cbetter than a bad deal or a deal that one side may violate.\u201d\nLaura Rosenberger, director of the Alliance for Securing Democracy, said in a tweet\u00a0that if Kim had indeed insisted on the lifting of all sanctions, it was \u201cgood sign\u201d that Trump had walked away from the negotiating table.\nThis story has been updated with quotes and background.", "date": "\n02/28/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-kim-jong-un-hanoi_n_5c777042e4b0952f89de39b0", "tags": "agreement nuclear summit korean abruptly fail reach \u201d trump collapse kim north hanoi talks"}
