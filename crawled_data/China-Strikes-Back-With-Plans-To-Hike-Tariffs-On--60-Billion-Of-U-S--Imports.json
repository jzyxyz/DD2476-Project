It said the tariffs will take effect on June 1.\nThe announcement came less than two hours after Trump warned Beijing not to retaliate after China said it \u201cwill never surrender to external pressure.\u201d\nThe White House and U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office did not immediately return a request for comment.\nGlobal equities fell sharply on Monday as hopes of an imminent trade deal between the world\u2019s two largest economies were crushed. Major U.S. stock index futures were down about 2 percent. [MKTS/GLOB]\nThe trade war escalated on Friday after Trump hiked tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, saying China had reneged on earlier commitments made during months of trade negotiations.\nBeijing had vowed to respond to the latest U.S. tariffs. \u201cAs for the details, please continue to pay attention. Copying a U.S. expression - wait and see,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a daily news briefing on Monday.\nTrump warned China not to intensify the trade dispute and urged its leaders, including President Xi Jinping, to continue to work to reach a deal. \u201cChina should not retaliate-will only get worse,\u201d he said on Twitter.\n\u201cI say openly to President Xi & all of my many friends in China that China will be hurt very badly if you don\u2019t make a deal because companies will be forced to leave China for other countries,\u201d Trump wrote.\nTrump last week also ordered U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to begin imposing tariffs on all remaining imports from China, a move that would affect an additional $300 billion worth of goods.\nAsked about the threat, Geng said: \u201cWe have said many times that adding tariffs won\u2019t resolve any problem ... We have the confidence and the ability to protect our lawful and legitimate rights.\u201d\nChinese state media kept up a steady drum beat of strongly worded commentary on Monday, reiterating that China\u2019s door to talks was always open, but vowing to defend the country\u2019s interests and dignity.\nIn a commentary, state television said the effect on the Chinese economy from the U.S. tariffs was \u201ctotally controllable.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s no big deal.\u00a0China is bound to turn crisis to opportunity and use this to test its abilities, to make the country even stronger.\u201d\nBefore high-level talks last week in Washington,\u00a0China tried to delete commitments from a draft agreement that Chinese laws would be changed to enact new policies on issues from intellectual property protection to forced technology transfers. That dealt a major setback to negotiations.\nTrump has since defended the U.S. tariff hike and said he was in \u201cabsolutely no rush\u201d to finalize a deal.\nTop White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Sunday there was a \u201cstrong possibility\u201d Trump will meet China\u2019s Xi at a G20 summit in Japan in late June.\n(Reporting by Ben Blanchard; Additional reporting by Makini Brice in Washington; Writing by Michael Martina; Editing by Darren Schuettler, Jeffrey Benkoe and Paul Simao)", "date": "\n05/13/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/china-strikes-back-with-plans-to-hike-tariffs-on-60-billion-of-us-imports_n_5cd96f2fe4b0796a95df7a6a", "tags": "china billion u-s- u.s. hike deal back \u201d strikes trade plans tariffs monday imports"}
