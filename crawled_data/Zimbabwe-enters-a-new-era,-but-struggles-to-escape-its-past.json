{"title": "Zimbabwe enters a new era, but struggles to escape its past", "content": "The deadly violence that followed Zimbabwe's first election since Robert Mugabe was ousted has created tension in a country that was hoping to put its past behind it, says BBC Africa editor Fergal Keane. \nThe political drama in this country has oscillated between euphoria, tragedy and farce - from a remarkably peaceful election day, to the shooting down of unarmed protesters, to the extraordinary sight of a president disowning the actions of his own police. \nEach day has produced the unexpected and created a febrile atmosphere in which questions about who really controls this country have deepened. \nIs it Emmerson Mnangagwa, who took over as president after the military takeover in November and won Monday's disputed presidential vote, or hardliners steeped in the brutal practices of the Mugabe era? \nEvents since the vote have not inspired much faith.\nSoldiers beat civilians in several opposition strongholds of the capital, Harare.\nI met a young man whose body was covered in bruises after being thrashed by the army when they attacked a bar.\nOutside our hotel in central Harare colleagues witnessed policemen beating two men for no apparent reason.\nThis was the behaviour of armed men who believed they could act with impunity. \nFar from the land of hope President Mnangagwa wishes to project, division appears to be the defining dynamic. \nYet there were some hopeful signals too on Friday, such as the appearance of a government minister instructing riot police to allow a press conference to go ahead and opposition leader Nelson Chamisa's explicit disavowal of violent behaviour by his MDC Alliance supporters.\nThese point to the influence of more moderate voices on both sides.\nThe MDC Alliance challenge to the election result will take the focus away from the streets and within that party there is already a process of self-questioning.\nSenior figures have spoken to me of the need to \"learn lessons from this defeat\".\nHow many votes were lost because of party divisions?\nThe party's dalliance with Mr Mugabe, 94, in the closing days of the campaign placed politics above democratic ideals and probably cost rather than gained votes. \nIn the days after the vote Mr Chamisa pre-emptively declared victory and began claiming a massive fraud. \nThe 'crocodile' who snapped back\nThe story behind Zimbabwe's scarf\nHis own statements and those of his colleague, Tendai Biti - who claimed he had evidence the pair were to be killed by a senior government minister - certainly raised the temperature among party supporters. \nThe ruling Zanu-PF party has won a two-thirds majority in parliament but it too struggles with factional problems.\nElected to his own position with only the slenderest of majorities the president will need more than his legendary cunning to navigate the days ahead.\nHe has enemies within Zanu-PF and among elements of the old regime. \nRemember it is just weeks since he survived an assassination attempt on the campaign trail. \nMr Mnangagwa needs to show that he is in charge of his security establishment and that he is willing to punish those who have abused civilians. \nThat will be a test of his democratic credentials but also of his relationship with the generals. \nIf he does not the conviction will deepen - at home and abroad - that nothing has changed.
