{"title": "Silvio Berlusconi: Italy's perpetual powerbroker", "content": "Few Italians have wielded more influence and attracted more notoriety than Silvio Berlusconi, four-time prime minister and billionaire businessman.\nFor years he successfully brushed off sex scandals and allegations of corruption.\nBut it was the effects of Italy's burgeoning eurozone debt crisis in 2011 that saw his influence temporarily wane as his coalition lost power.\nWorse was to come for the man whom many Italians had come to see as untouchable.\nHe was convicted of tax fraud in 2013 and ejected from the Italian Senate. Because of his age, a four-year jail term became a year of community service at a care home near Milan. \nAnother conviction in 2015 and it looked like his political career was finally over. \nBut despite suffering a heart attack that his doctor said could have killed him in 2016, the charismatic showman was set for yet another political comeback. \nHe is barred from public office due to his criminal record, but the 81-year-old's name was still on the ballot for voters going to the polls in Italy's general election on 4 March. \nHis centre-right Forza Italia party, which led the opinion polls in coalition with two far-right parties, had Berlusconi emblazoned across its logo.\nBerlusconi, 79, remains one of Italy's richest men. He and his family have built a fortune estimated at $8bn (\u00a35.8bn; \u20ac6.6bn) by US business magazine Forbes.\nBorn on 29 September 1936, Berlusconi was a child during World War Two. Like many Milan youngsters, he was evacuated and lived with his mother in a village some distance from the city.\nHe began his career selling vacuum cleaners and built a reputation as a singer, first in nightclubs and then on cruise ships.\n\"I had a repertoire of 150 different songs and I took requests from the audience,\" he told biographer Alan Friedman. \nHe graduated in law in 1961 and then set up Edilnord, a construction company, establishing himself as a residential housing developer around his native Milan. \nTen years later he launched a local cable-television outfit - Telemilano - which would grow into Italy's biggest media empire, Mediaset, controlling the country's three largest private TV stations.\nHis huge Fininvest holding company now has Mediaset and Italy's largest publishing house Mondadori under its umbrella, and has stakes in daily newspaper Il Giornale among other companies.\nBerlusconi sold AC Milan football club to Chinese investors for \u00a3628m (\u20ac740m) in 2017.\nHis children - Marina, Barbara, Pier Silvio, Eleonora and Luigi - all take part in the running of his business empire.\nIn 1993, Berlusconi founded his own political party, Forza Italia (Go Italy), named after an Italian football chant.\nThe following year he became prime minister, heading a coalition with the right-wing National Alliance and Northern League.\nMany hoped his business acumen could help revitalise Italy's economy. They longed for a break with the corruption and instability, which had marred Italian politics for a decade.\nBut rivalries between the three coalition leaders, coupled with Berlusconi's indictment for alleged tax fraud by a Milan court, confounded those hopes and led to the collapse of the government seven months later.\nThen came the first of his political comebacks:\nAs tensions mounted over his tax fraud conviction, the party split and Berlusconi relaunched it under the old name, Forza Italia. \nHe was away from the political centre stage for about four years after he was expelled from parliament. \nBut he firmly returned to the scene when a coalition he backed won Sicily's regional elections in November 2017.\nIn a coalition with the right-wing Northern League and Brothers of Italy parties, Forza Italia appeared to win most seats in the lower house of parliament in the 4 March general election.\nBut no single block secured enough to form a majority government.\nMeanwhile, Berlusconi is seeking to overturn the ban that bars him from public office at the European Court of Human Rights.\nMuch of Berlusconi's political career has run in tandem with a litany of legal battles. A native of Milan, he has frequently complained of being victimised by its legal authorities.\nIn 2009, he estimated that over 20 years he had made 2,500 court appearances in 106 trials, at a legal cost of \u20ac200m.\nHe denied embezzlement, tax fraud and false accounting, and attempting to bribe a judge. And on numerous occasions he was acquitted, had convictions overturned or watched them expire under a statute of limitations.\nBut he received a setback when in 2011 the Constitutional Court struck down part of a law granting him and other senior ministers temporary immunity.\nBy the end of the year he was out of power and in October 2012 he was given four years for tax fraud and barred from public office.\nBut it was not until 1 August 2013 that Italy's Supreme Court upheld the verdict. Berlusconi declared his innocence and spoke of a \"judicial coup\".\nBecause he was over 75, he did not go to jail but did community service, working four hours a week with elderly dementia patients at a Catholic care home near Milan.\nRead more: The many trials of Berlusconi\nBerlusconi's struggles in the political arena and the courtroom have been accompanied by a string of lascivious reports about his private life.\nHe met second wife Veronica Lario after she performed topless in a play.\nWhen he was photographed at the 18th birthday party of aspiring model Noemi Letizia, she decided to divorce him and also accused him of selecting a \"shamelessly trashy\" list of candidates for the European Parliament.\nBut his reputation was tarnished most by allegations of raunchy \"bunga-bunga\" parties at his private villa attended by showgirls. The reports culminated in a conviction of paying for sex with an underage prostitute.\nRead more: An explanation of bunga bunga\nIn October 2010, it emerged that Berlusconi had called a police station asking for the release of a 17-year-old girl, Karima \"Ruby\" El Mahroug.\nShe was being held for theft and was also said to have attended his \"bunga-bunga\" parties. \nIn June 2013 he was found guilty of paying her for sex, and of abuse of power. The case was eventually overturned in 2014.\nBut he is now set to stand trial accused of bribing a witness - something he denies. \nBerlusconi has always maintained he is \"no saint\" but firmly rejects claims he has ever paid for sex with a woman, saying: \"I never understood where the satisfaction is when you're missing the pleasure of conquest.\"\nHis turn of phrase has always delighted like-thinkers and horrified critics. In one example, he said his family was so persecuted they felt \"like the families of Jews... under Hitler's regime\". The remark drew condemnation from Italian Jews.", "date": "5 March 2018", "href": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-11981754", "tags": "powerbroker tax berlusconi court milan political coalition sex italy perpetual silvio years fraud"}
