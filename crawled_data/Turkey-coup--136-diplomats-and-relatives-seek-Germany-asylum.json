{"title": "Turkey coup: 136 diplomats and relatives seek Germany asylum", "content": "Germany says it has received 136 asylum requests from Turks holding diplomatic passports since the July coup attempt against the Turkish president.\nThe figure is a total for the period August 2016 to January 2017, German media report.\nTurkey has urged Germany not to grant asylum to any military officers. Some posted to Nato bases in Germany are thought to be among the group.\nIn Greece, two more Turkish soldiers have requested asylum. \nThe pair - reported to be commandos - are believed to have taken part in the failed coup against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\nThey are in Greek police custody, having applied for asylum last week in Orestiada, a small border town near Turkey. \nLast month a Greek court rejected Turkey's request to extradite eight other Turkish soldiers who fled after the coup attempt. Turkey is appealing against that ruling.\nThe German interior ministry did not identify the 136 Turks who requested asylum. Not only diplomats but also their spouses and children hold diplomatic passports. \nIt is not clear if any of them have been granted asylum yet.\nWho are the Gulenists?\nWho was behind coup attempt?\nBrief guide to Turkey's coup\n''Open, police!' The day a Turkish writer's life changed\nSoldiers who fled after the coup attempt fear that they will not get a fair trial in Turkey. \nThe Turkish authorities have dismissed at least 100,000 public servants, including teachers, police and members of the judiciary. \nAbout 43,000 suspects are in detention. The crackdown is targeting suspected supporters of Fethullah Gulen, a cleric who lives in self-imposed exile in the US.  \nMr Erdogan's ruling AK Party has also shut down more than 130 media outlets, during a continuing state of emergency, and arrested about 150 journalists.\nSeveral prominent German politicians have spoken out against a possible campaign visit by Mr Erdogan. Turks will vote in a referendum on 16 April to decide whether Mr Erdogan should have sweeping new presidential powers. \nThe referendum will ask Turks if they agree to constitutional changes to make Turkey a presidential state, reducing parliament's powers.\nTurkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim addressed a rally in Oberhausen, north-western Germany, on Saturday and said Mr Erdogan had plans to visit the region in March. But it has not been officially confirmed.\nAbout 1.4 million Turks living in Germany are on Turkey's electoral register. \nOberhausen is in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, where state interior minister Ralf Jaeger warned that \"we must prevent Turkish internal conflicts being played out here\".\nThe Social Democrat (SPD) politician said Turkey's controversial referendum would lead to \"restricted fundamental rights and a return of the death penalty\". \nGerman-Turkish relations have been severely strained by the AKP's post-coup crackdown. \nRecently German police searched the homes of four imams amid reports that Ditib, a Muslim organisation funded by the Turkish state, was spying on suspected Gulen supporters in Germany.\nDitib is short for the Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs. \nNorth Rhine-Westphalia is also investigating claims that Turkish diplomats asked school pupils and teachers in some schools to report any criticism of Mr Erdogan to them.\nTurkey has accused German officials of conducting a \"witch-hunt\", telling them to focus instead on \"terror organisations\" such as the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). \nPolitical tensions are already running high in Germany ahead of crucial parliamentary elections in September.", "date": "24 February 2017", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-39075157", "tags": "turkey diplomats germany turks german seek asylum state turkish coup relatives erdogan"}
