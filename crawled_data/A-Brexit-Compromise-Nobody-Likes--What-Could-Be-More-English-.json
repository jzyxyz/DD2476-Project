{"title": "A Brexit Compromise Nobody Likes: What Could Be More English?", "content": "LONDON \u2014 With the sputtering of the hard-line Conservative coup against Prime Minister Theresa May over her Brexit plan this week, the British Parliament seemed to be turning, slowly and with a great grinding of gears, in the direction of something quintessentially English: a compromise that satisfies no one.\nThere are historical precedents for this type of solution. Take the English Civil War, which pitted the monarchy against Parliament. What did England get? A little of both, followed by several centuries of grumbling on either side.\nThe national split over fox hunting, another deep social division, ended in a \u201cmasterly British compromise,\u201d as former Prime Minister Tony Blair phrased it, that left hunting \u201cbanned and not quite banned at the same time.\u201d And consider the creation of the National Health Service, which the Conservative Party opposed tooth and nail \u2014 and then accepted, sometimes grudgingly, for 70 years and counting.\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of the English DNA, it is in our culture, to find a compromise, usually one we are not happy with,\u201d said the social anthropologist Kate Fox, the author of \u201cWatching the English: The Hidden Rules of English Behavior.\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean we compromise graciously,\u201d she said. \u201cWe compromise in an Eeyorish, grumpy, vaguely stoical way. And we complain, constantly. But only to each other. We rarely address our complaints to anyone who might be in a position to resolve them. That\u2019s kind of what I was expecting with Brexit.\u201d\nOn Thursday, Mrs. May reached an agreement with European negotiators on a document outlining future ties.\nHer greater task, though, is persuading her own Parliament to approve her draft agreement on withdrawing from the European Union, a deal that, when initially presented to the country a week ago, had all the popular appeal of an opossum carcass.\nStill, in the days since Mrs. May\u2019s disastrous rollout, hard-line positions seemed to be softening.\nSomething curious happened: Last Thursday, when Mrs. May revealed the details of her plan, 47 percent of respondents said she should step down and only 33 percent said she should stay, according to a poll by YouGov for The Times of London.\nFive days later, after she had weathered rounds of punishing criticism, the responses were reversed, with 46 percent saying she should stay and 34 percent that she should go. A bungled coup by hard-line Brexiteers in her own party \u2014 who want a more complete break from the European Union than she has proposed \u2014 had left her most aggressive detractors looking isolated and foolish.\nAnd many in Westminster began speaking confidently of a new wrinkle. Mrs. May might not muster enough Parliamentary support to pass the bill in mid-December, according to Rob Ford, a professor of politics at the University of Manchester. But if her government survives long enough to put it to a second vote, he said, she has a good chance of getting it through.\n\u201cThe groups that dislike it will realize that there is no way of getting their preferred outcome,\u201d he said. \u201cThe deal could be as popular as leprosy with the public and that strategic calculus would not have changed one iota.\u201d\nLeprosy indeed. Remainers don\u2019t like it because they did not want to leave the European Union in the first place. Hard-line Brexiteers don\u2019t like it because it leaves Britain in too many European structures. Soft Brexiteers \u2014 who want, well, a softer break \u2014 don\u2019t like it because it removes the country from too many structures. The only people who are satisfied are those primarily concerned with immigration, and polls, Mr. Ford said, suggest that group is rapidly shrinking.\nEven the Daily Mail newspaper, which, under its former editor, Paul Dacre, pushed Brexit with unbridled ferocity and policed the political class for the slightest hint of apostasy, has softened under Mr. Dacre\u2019s successor, Geordie Greig, offering lukewarm support for the prime minister.\nIt was difficult to recall, in the gloom and resignation of this week, that Brexit had at one point made some people happy.\nTim Stanley, a historian and journalist who supported leaving the European Union, recalled the day of the referendum, June 23, 2016, as a day of \u201cabsolute euphoria, and a sense of being part of something bigger than myself.\u201d Last week, he said he supported Mrs. May\u2019s deal \u2014 he called it \u201ca compromise to get us somewhere\u201d \u2014 but there was no note of triumph.\n\u201cWhat she is offering people is the least worst of their nightmares,\u201d said Mr. Stanley, who writes for the Daily Telegraph newspaper. \u201cThe tragedy is that when we leave next March, there won\u2019t be fireworks or a parade. This should have been a revival of British democracy; it should have been a feeling like V-E Day, that we had triumphed over the Eurocrats. It\u2019s sad that it won\u2019t come, I think.\u201d\nHe blamed some of this on Mrs. May, who, he said, \u201cdoesn\u2019t do inspiration.\u201d\n\u201cA Brexit run by a Remainer, it\u2019s going to be downbeat, it\u2019s going to be gloomy,\u201d he said.\nBut gloom also seems to be part of a considered strategy on Mrs. May\u2019s part. As they make the rounds of Parliament this week, her proxies have made a forceful case for letting go of unrealistic hopes \u2014 and the risks that go with them.\n\u201cIt is time to shoot the unicorns,\u201d one May ally told Matt Chorley, a politics writer for The Times of London.\nOn this, there is some evidence of success. The Conservative lawmaker Kenneth Clarke, a longtime and staunch opponent of leaving the European Union, told the BBC on Tuesday that Mrs. May\u2019s deal was \u201ca bit of a dog\u2019s breakfast,\u201d but that he would support it anyway to avoid the danger of exiting without a deal. Mrs. May also secured the backing of Nick Boles, a Brexiteer member of her party who has for weeks excoriated her proposed \u201cimplementation period\u201d in favor of a three-year membership in the European Economic Area, a solution known as \u201cNorway for now.\u201d\nIn much of the country, the primary response to the events of last week was exhaustion. The standup comedian Bridget Christie said people she knew felt \u201cembarrassed, confused, frustrated, cheated, betrayed, sad, upset, worried, anxious, disgusted, ashamed, impotent, powerless, depressed, baffled and desperate.\u201d\nAsked if she knew anyone who felt happy about the possible outcomes that emerged this week, she answered, \u201cAre you joking?\u201d\nAnd on this point, Britain may at last have reached common ground.\n\u201cI would think there might just be a majority for the sentiment of \u2018Oh, God, let\u2019s get it over with.\u2019 You might win a vote on that,\u201d said Ian Hislop, the editor of the satirical magazine Private Eye.\n\u201cWe\u2019re headed toward acceptance. We\u2019ve done anger, we\u2019ve done disbelief,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t ask me. I may stay in a state of denial.\u201d", "date": "Nov. 22, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/22/world/europe/brexit-uk-theresa-may.html", "tags": "brexit european may nobody compromise week likes english \u201d could \u2014 mrs."}
