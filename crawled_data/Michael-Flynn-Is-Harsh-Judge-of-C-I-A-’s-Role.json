{"title": "Michael Flynn Is Harsh Judge of C.I.A.\u2019s Role", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Long before Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn became Donald J. Trump\u2019s choice for national security adviser, he believed that the Central Intelligence Agency had become a political tool of the Obama administration \u2014 a view now echoed by the president-elect in his mocking dismissals of C.I.A. assessments that Russia sought to tip the election in Mr. Trump\u2019s favor.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve lost sight of who they actually work for,\u201d Mr. Flynn said in an interview with The New York Times in October 2015. \u201cThey work for the American people. They don\u2019t work for the president of the United States.\u201d He added, speaking of the agency\u2019s leadership: \u201cFrankly, it\u2019s become a very political organization.\u201d\nMr. Flynn\u2019s assessment that the C.I.A. is a political arm of the Obama administration is not widely shared by Republicans or Democrats in Washington. But it has appeared to have been internalized by the one person who matters most right now: Mr. Trump.\nIn the past few days, Mr. Trump has sought to portray reports of the agency\u2019s assessments that Russia actively tried to interfere in the election as a desperate attempt by sore losers to taint his presidency before it begins. His denigration of C.I.A. officials as \u201cthe same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction\u201d has opened up an extraordinary rift between the president-elect and the nation\u2019s intelligence community that is unlikely to be bridged anytime soon.\nAlthough it is unclear how much Mr. Flynn, 57, is responsible for Mr. Trump\u2019s response to the C.I.A. assessment, during the presidential campaign he had substantial influence on the president-elect. He brought to the campaign views on Muslims and national security that tended to hew far closer to the right-wing fringes than the mainstream of the Republican Party.\nMr. Flynn also appears to have helped set the tone for Mr. Trump\u2019s testy relationship with the intelligence community. In August, when the Trump campaign received its first intelligence briefing, Mr. Flynn was so combative with the briefers that another person in the room had to urge him to settle down, according to a person familiar with the episode who was told about it in confidence.\nOn any number of issues \u2014 from the Obama administration\u2019s failure to foresee the rise of the Islamic State to Mr. Flynn\u2019s ouster as chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency, the intelligence arm of the Defense Department \u2014 he has made it clear in recent years that he sees the political hand of the C.I.A. at work.\nAs director of the D.I.A. from 2012 to 2014, he pushed hard for his agency, long treated as second-rate by the C.I.A., to be given greater access to the trove of documents and other materials seized during the raid that killed Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan, in May 2011. The C.I.A. controlled the material, and Mr. Flynn became convinced that the agency was refusing to share or declassify much of it because of fears that it would undermine the administration\u2019s narrative about Al Qaeda\u2019s waning strength at the time Bin Laden was killed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all political with\u201d the C.I.A. leadership, Mr. Flynn said in the 2015 interview, which focused on the rise of the Islamic State and American national security.\n\u201cIf they put out what we knew, then the president could have not said, in a national election, \u2018Al Qaeda\u2019s on the run and we\u2019ve killed Bin Laden,\u2019\u201d he said, referring to Mr. Obama\u2019s 2012 re-election campaign. \u201cEven today, he talks about Bin Laden as though that was a stroke of genius.\u201d\nMr. Flynn also questioned the decision to kill Bin Laden. \u201cKilling Bin Laden was the wrong thing to do,\u201d he said. \u201cThey could have captured him.\u201d\nIn killing Bin Laden, he said, \u201cwe created a new version of Allah.\u201d\n\u201cWhat we should have done is shown him to be a decrepit old guy, put him in a freaking cage, in a cell, and put him on trial,\u201d Mr. Flynn added. \u201cMake it a big messy trial, make it global.\u201d\nMr. Flynn has also said that the C.I.A., at the urging of the White House, was playing down warnings from the D.I.A. about the resurgence of Al Qaeda in Iraq, which would later become the Islamic State. \u201cI\u2019m telling you, the C.I.A. has a lot to reflect on because of this,\u201d he said.\nA number of current and former officials dispute Mr. Flynn\u2019s account, saying concerns about the resurgence of Islamist militants in the midst of Syria\u2019s civil war were widespread in the intelligence community.\nMr. Flynn, who was fired from the D.I.A. after serving only two years of a three-year appointment, has described his dismissal as an act of political retribution by the C.I.A. and Obama administration officials who did not want to hear what he was saying.\nOther officials, including some with direct knowledge of the decision to dismiss Mr. Flynn, said he was forced out for a more straightforward reason: He was not a good manager, and his efforts to reform the agency left it in chaos.\nIt was not Mr. Flynn\u2019s first run-in with the civilian intelligence community. The ill will stretches back years, current and former officials said, and it transformed into open hostility when Mr. Flynn was running military intelligence under Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal in Afghanistan.\nIn January 2010, after less than a year on the job, Mr. Flynn released a paper, \u201cFixing Intel,\u201d that was highly critical of American intelligence work in Afghanistan. It bluntly stated that \u201cthe U.S. intelligence community is only marginally relevant to the overall strategy,\u201d and said that it had only itself to blame because it had failed to understand Afghanistan\u2019s cultural complexities.\nThe paper was widely praised in defense circles as insightful. But at the C.I.A., officials were furious at what they saw as a direct attack on the aptitude and professionalism of the roughly 1,000 agency personnel who were serving in Afghanistan at the time.\nThey were also incensed at the timing of the paper, which became public five days after a suicide attack that killed seven C.I.A. officers at a base in eastern Afghanistan. Mr. Flynn\u2019s searing critique was seen at the agency as the height of insensitivity.\nMr. Flynn has been unapologetic about his views of not only the C.I.A. but other national security agencies, including the D.I.A. under his leadership.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve really been lying to the American public,\u201d he said in the interview, referring to the Obama administration and much of the national security and intelligence establishment. \u201cThe Department of Defense and those of us that have allowed this sort of a happy talk \u2014 \u2018We\u2019re moving in the right direction, things are working.\u2019 It\u2019s not. The Taliban are going to come back into power, or ISIS is going to come back into power.\u201d", "date": "Dec. 12, 2016", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/12/us/politics/donald-trump-cia-michael-flynn.html", "tags": "bin intelligence judge agency \u201d c.i.a flynn michael c.i.a. role harsh"}
