{"title": "U.S. Begins First Cyberoperation Against Russia Aimed at Protecting Elections", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The United States Cyber Command is targeting individual Russian operatives to try to deter them from spreading disinformation to interfere in elections, telling them that American operatives have identified them and are tracking their work, according to officials briefed on the operation.\nThe campaign, which includes missions undertaken in recent days, is the first known overseas cyberoperation to protect American elections, including the November midterms.\nThe operations come as the Justice Department outlined on Friday a campaign of \u201cinformation warfare\u201d by Russians aimed at influencing the midterm elections, highlighting the broad threat the American government sees from Moscow\u2019s influence campaign.\nDefense officials would not say how many individuals they were targeting, and they would not describe the methods that Cyber Command has used to send the direct messages to the operatives behind the influence campaigns. It is not clear if the information was delivered in an email, a chat or some other electronic intervention.\nSenior defense officials said they were not directly threatening the operatives. Still, former officials said anyone singled out would know, based on the United States government\u2019s actions against other Russian operatives, that they could be indicted or targeted with sanctions. Even the unstated threat of sanctions could help deter some Russians from participating in covert disinformation campaigns, said Andrea Kendall-Taylor, a former intelligence official now with the Center for a New American Security.\n\u201cThis would be a way to generate leverage that can change behavior,\u201d she said.\nThe Cyber Command operations appear relatively measured, especially in comparison with the increasingly elaborate and sophisticated efforts by Russia to use disinformation to sow dissent in the United States.\nBut the American campaign undertaken in response to Russia\u2019s information offensive is limited in large part to keep Moscow from escalating in response by taking down the power grid or conducting some other reprisal that could trigger a bigger clash between great powers. Compared with traditional armed conflict, the rules of cyberwarfare are not well defined.\nCyber Command was founded in 2009 to defend military networks but has also developed offensive capabilities. The command shares a headquarters and leadership with the National Security Agency, which collects electronic and signals intelligence. A joint Cyber Command-N.S.A. team has been working on the effort to identify and deter foreign influence campaigns.\nAmerican officials also said the campaign is one aspect of a broader effort, which includes purges by social media companies of fake accounts that spread propaganda, to fight Russian intrusion in democratic elections. Cyber Command has also sent teams to Europe to shore up the defenses of American allies and partners so they can combat Russian intrusions on their own government networks, according to defense officials.\nAmerican intelligence officials have concluded that Russia is unlikely to try to hack into voting machines or directly manipulate voting results this year. On Friday, the director of national intelligence said that state and local governments have reported attempted intrusions into their networks, but that foreign governments have not penetrated voting systems.\nBut Russian efforts to sway public opinion by spreading false information have continued, and officials said those efforts are becoming more refined, targeting specific groups of Americans. Almost all of the Russian disinformation efforts, according to current and former officials, are aimed at sowing dissent, polarizing the political parties and setting the stage for the 2020 presidential election.\nThe defense officials would not identify their targets. But other officials said some of the targets were involved in previous Russian efforts to spread disinformation in the United States and Europe, including the 2016 presidential election. The new American campaign, according to these officials, is aimed at both oligarch-funded hacking groups and Russian intelligence operatives who are part of Moscow\u2019s disinformation campaign. It is not clear whether Cyber Command\u2019s effort is also aimed at halting Russian operatives charged with hacking political entities.\nOthers said the American government must be ready to go further \u2014 cutting off the Russians\u2019 ability to spread propaganda.\n\u201cIt is very important to identify the source and essentially be able to neutralize that source,\u201d said Laura Rosenberger, the director of the Alliance for Securing Democracy and a former Obama administration official. \u201cThese are networks that operate. The more we can identify the key nodes in those networks and remove them by taking them offline is really how we will get at this problem in a systemic way and not play Whac-a-Mole.\u201d\nGen. Paul M. Nakasone, the head of Cyber Command and the National Security Agency, hinted at the new cyberoperations this month as he noted that American adversaries are \u201clooking to really take us on below that level of armed conflict\u201d by sowing distrust in society and \u201cattempt to disrupt our elections.\u201d\n\u201cThis is what great power competition looks like today, and it\u2019s what we will look at as we look to the future,\u201d he said during a panel discussion in Washington.\nCyber Command has a relatively short history of overseas operations against adversaries, but it did conduct missions aimed at curtailing the ability of the Islamic State to spread propaganda and recruit online. Those operations, which included efforts to freeze computers, yielded mixed results.\nAssessing the effectiveness of American cyberoperations at this point is difficult. The director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, is expected to complete a review after the November midterm elections.\nBut some American officials said they believed the initial operations had at least partly diminished the effectiveness of Moscow\u2019s election manipulation effort.\nSimilarly, British officials also said they had seen less activity by Russian propagandists than expected after their identification of the Russian intelligence agents behind the poisoning in the spring of a former Russian spy and the Dutch authorities\u2019 detailing this month of a failed Russian cyberattack on the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.\nOutside experts believe that a major reason Russian social media trolls are less effective is aggressive work by technology companies. Twitter and Facebook purges of Russian-created or -controlled accounts have reduced the effectiveness of Moscow\u2019s propaganda, said Ben Nimmo, an expert on Russia\u2019s online misinformation efforts at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Digital Forensic Research Lab.\nSome American officials have said they were frustrated by what they viewed as President Trump\u2019s timidity at taking on the Russians involved in election meddling. Mr. Trump has frequently wavered about whether he believes the Russians interfered in the 2016 elections to help his bid for the presidency.\nBut officials said broad agreement existed throughout the rest of the government that the Russian interference campaign was ongoing and required a more muscular response to deter further meddling.\nWith the new campaign, American officials said, they are trying to hamper Russia from meddling in the 2018 vote and deter future efforts. Cyber Command\u2019s new operations reflect a push by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to expand the Pentagon\u2019s role countering Russian hackers threatening America and its allies. In the White House, John R. Bolton, the national security adviser, has also been pushing to speed up approval for election defense operations.\nMr. Bolton announced new cyberwarfare authorities last month, but the White House provided few details. Under the new guidelines, Mr. Trump has handed off approval for certain actions to the National Security Council, secretary of defense or head of Cyber Command, depending on the operation.\nIn the final months of the Obama administration, as details of Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election were uncovered, officials privately pushed Cyber Command and the National Security Agency to create options to respond.\nCyber Command and the N.S.A. were hesitant to offer options, a former official said, out of concern that if they tried to directly deter Moscow\u2019s activities, Russian operatives would learn too much about America\u2019s espionage techniques, among the government\u2019s most closely held secrets.\nSince taking the helm of Cyber Command and the N.S.A. in May, General Nakasone has said he has the authority to act against adversaries threatening American elections. Inside both the command and the agency, he has pushed to develop new options to deter interference.\nAmerican officials say the Russian effort to destabilize the American elections is closely tied to Moscow\u2019s work in Europe.\nThe criminal complaint unsealed on Friday showed that Elena Alekseevna Khusyaynova, the St. Petersburg accountant involved in the disinformation campaign in the United States, was also active in Europe, including in Ukraine, considered the focus of Moscow\u2019s efforts to weaken its neighbors and the West.\nCyber Command has also sent teams to Ukraine, Macedonia and Montenegro to build up defenses against Russian hackers intent on penetrating government networks on its doorstep in Eastern Europe.\nThe United States is helping Montenegro remove Russian cyberoperatives from nonclassified government systems, a senior Montenegrin official said. Painstaking work, the effort could take months to find and close all the access points Russian hackers have created. Russians have not penetrated the government\u2019s classified systems, the official said.\nEuropean leaders have been asking the United States to take a bigger role in helping block Russian meddling and cyberactivity.\nLithuania is working with the United States on military cyberdefense training as well as research and development on cyberdefenses, President Dalia Grybauskaite said an interview. But Ms. Grybauskaite has also pushed for expanded cooperation, including a rotating presence of military experts at Lithuania\u2019s cyberdefense center.\n\u201cWhat we see is a steadily growing pressure on cyber, the information front, propaganda and, recently, fake news,\u201d Ms. Grybauskaite said. \u201cTheir efforts and instruments are becoming more sophisticated every day.\u201d", "date": "Oct. 23, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/23/us/politics/russian-hacking-usa-cyber-command.html", "tags": "american efforts officials first russian cyberoperation u.s. cyber elections command \u201d aimed protecting russia begins campaign"}
