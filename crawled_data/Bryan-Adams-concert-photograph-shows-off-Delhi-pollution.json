It bans activities like rubbish burning to try and improve air quality in the region.\nThe photograph, which showed a ghost-like figure above concert-goers holding phone lights, was taken by Adams at Leisure Valley Park in Gurgaon, south-west of Delhi. \nThe singer is currently in the midst of a 66-date world tour, including five Indian dates. \nIn comments on his social media, Indian fans thanked him for a \"legendary\" performance at the concert, which was attended by thousands.\nOne user commented on the unusual \"ghost\" photograph effect: \"All the Delhi pollution has come to some good use hahahahaha.\" ", "date": "15 October 2018", "href": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-45867868", "tags": "delhi showed world media pollution social bryan shows photograph indian fans air adams concert"}
