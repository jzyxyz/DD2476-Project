{"title": "Trump Finally Switches Up His Lie That China Pays Tariffs To The U-S- Treasury", "content": "President Donald Trump\u00a0has finally dropped his ruse that China pays tariffs to the U.S. Instead, he emphasized another trade lie on Monday.\nTrump has repeatedly insisted that China pays tariffs directly to the U.S. government. But it\u2019s actually U.S. importers who pay tariffs for Chinese goods, and they pass those costs to U.S. consumers in the form of higher product prices.\u00a0\nTrump finally appeared to concede in a tweet that Americans are the ones who really shoulder tariff costs. But he said \u201cthere is no reason\u201d they have to pay them \u2014 as long as they buy from a \u201cnon-Tariffed Country.\u201d\nMany American goods, however, contain parts from different countries, so it\u2019s difficult to dodge products that aren\u2019t affected by tariffs.\nTrump also said tariff costs can be avoided if products are purchased \u201cinside the USA,\u201d but that\u2019s clearly not the case with products hit by tariffs \u2014 even if people buy them in the U.S.\nTrump also tweeted \u2014 again \u2014 that tariffs have helped the U.S. economy, which is not true according to his own economic adviser. \u201cSome people just don\u2019t get it!\u201d Trump wrote.\nWhite House chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow conceded to Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday that Trump\u2019s tariffs have\u00a0hurt jobs as well as GDP.\u00a0 He estimates that loss to be about two-tenths of 1 percent of GDP \u2014 lower than many economists\u2019 estimates \u2014 and called it a \u201cvery modest number\u201d and \u201cso small.\u201d But The Washington Post noted that Kudlow\u2019s estimate amounts to\u00a0about $40 billion.\nIn addition, trade fears sent global\u00a0stock markets plunging Monday, wiping out $1 trillion in value\u00a0around the world, Bloomberg reported.\nKudlow also admitted to Wallace \u2014 despite Trump\u2019s earlier claims \u2014 that Americans pay the costs of the tariffs.\nChina announced Monday it will hike tariffs June 1 on $60 billion of U.S. imports in retaliation for the Trump administration\u2019s increased tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods last week.", "date": "\n05/13/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-tariffs-lie-china_n_5cd9ef47e4b073aa0b32527c", "tags": "pays china u-s- costs u.s. monday treasury finally trump switches \u201d lie pay tariffs \u2014"}
