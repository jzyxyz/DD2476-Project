Wray, the F.B.I. director, defended his work force in an email on Monday, a day after President Trump said on Twitter that the agency\u2019s standing was the \u201cworst in History\u201d and its reputation was in \u201cTatters.\u201d\nIn a message to the F.B.I.\u2019s 35,000 agents and support staff that was provided to The New York Times, Mr. Wray said that he was \u201cinspired by example after example of professionalism and dedication to justice demonstrated around the bureau. It is truly an honor to represent you.\u201d He did not mention Mr. Trump by name.\nThe president\u2019s criticism was among several recent indications of his fury over the Justice Department investigation into links between his campaign and Russia. He accused F.B.I. agents of unfair treatment of Michael T. Flynn, his former national security adviser, who pleaded guilty last week to lying to the F.B.I. In another weekend tweet, Mr. Trump said he fired Mr. Flynn for doing so.\nCritics seized on that assertion as evidence that the president obstructed justice, a confession that he knew Mr. Flynn had committed a crime when, a day after firing him, he pressured the former F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, to drop the investigation into Mr. Flynn, according to testimony from Mr. Comey.\nBut one of Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers, John Dowd, said that his client did not write the tweet and suggested that the president cannot be prosecuted on such a charge.\nMr. Dowd argued in a statement to the news website Axios that Mr. Trump \u201ccannot obstruct justice because he is the chief law enforcement officer\u201d under the Constitution, and thus \u201chas every right to express his view of any case.\u201d\nA White House spokesman traveling with the president on Monday would not answer questions about the president\u2019s tweets. Mr. Trump has denied that he tried to impede the F.B.I. investigation into Mr. Flynn, portraying Mr. Comey, who wrote contemporaneous memos about his talks with Mr. Trump before the president fired him, as a liar.\nThe furor over the president\u2019s tweets highlighted the complexity of the obstruction accusations. Both the facts of what happened and the law that should be applied to those facts remain in dispute, even as the actions under scrutiny stretch in different directions, from Mr. Flynn\u2019s misconduct to the fate of the far broader Russian interference investigation.\nSamuel W. Buell, a Duke University law professor and former federal prosecutor, said that the argument by Mr. Trump\u2019s defenders went too far because it would place any president above the law even if he or she exercises a presidential power for illegitimate purposes. While Congress can impeach presidents for conduct beyond violations of ordinary law, he said, analyzing the obstruction statutes would be an obvious starting point.\n\u201cIf they want to argue factually that Trump fired Comey because he thought he was a bad F.B.I. director and that is all it was, then that is not obstruction because he\u2019s exercising the presidential power properly,\u201d Mr. Buell said. \u201cBut if he pressures Comey and asks him to drop the Flynn investigation in order to protect the president and his most senior advisers, that is an improper exercise of presidential authority.\u201d\nThe president\u2019s renewed drumbeat against the investigation came after the revelation on Friday that Mr. Flynn had accepted a plea deal and agreed to cooperate with Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation.\n\u201cI feel badly for General Flynn,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Monday as he left the White House for an event in Utah. \u201cI feel very badly. He\u2019s led a very strong life, and I feel very badly.\nHe added: \u201cHillary Clinton lied many times to the F.B.I. Nothing happened to her. Flynn lied and they destroyed his life.\u201d\nThe president\u2019s comments about the F.B.I. angered agents and other staff who have been caught in a political maelstrom since the president dismissed Mr. Comey. The F.B.I. had hoped that after firing Mr. Comey, the president would stop targeting the bureau.\nMr. Trump compared Mr. Flynn\u2019s case to the federal investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s handling of classified information. After being interviewed by the F.B.I., she was not charged.\nMr. Wray, who has run the F.B.I. for about four months, told his employees to ignore any criticism and to continue to uphold the Constitution.\n\u201cWe find ourselves under the microscope each and every day \u2014 and rightfully so. We do hard work for a living,\u201d he said, adding that the F.B.I. should \u201ccontinue to keep focused on our critical mission.\u201d\nThe email concluded with one of his favorite maxims: \u201cKeep calm and tackle hard.\u201d\nAn F.B.I. spokesman declined to comment.\nThe president\u2019s longstanding claim that no connections exist between his associates and Russia also suffered a blow on Monday evening when prosecutors revealed in court documents that his former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, had been in contact with \u201ca longtime Russian colleague\u201d believed to have ties to Russian intelligence.\nA person close to Mr. Manafort identified the associate as Konstantin V. Kilimnik, who worked for years as Mr. Manafort\u2019s close aide in Ukraine and communicated with him throughout the 2016 presidential campaign.\nThe two drafted an op-ed article last week about Mr. Manafort\u2019s work for Russian-aligned interests in Ukraine, according to court papers filed by Mr. Mueller\u2019s prosecutors in arguing for tougher bail restrictions for Mr. Manafort. He has pleaded not guilty to charges of money laundering and lobbying violations related to his work for Viktor F. Yanukovych, the former Ukrainian president.\nMr. Kilimnik was born in Ukraine when it was a part of the Soviet Union and served briefly in the Russian Army as a linguist, later telling associates that he had a background in Russian intelligence. But as scrutiny of his work with Mr. Manafort mounted this year, Mr. Kilimnik denied any such association. And an investigation by Ukrainian prosecutors into Mr. Kilimnik\u2019s possible ties to Russian spy agencies was closed last year without charges.", "date": "Dec. 4, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/04/us/politics/christopher-wray-fbi-agents.html", "tags": "\u2018 f.b.i comey investigation president director \u201d trump defends flynn says bureau tatters"}
