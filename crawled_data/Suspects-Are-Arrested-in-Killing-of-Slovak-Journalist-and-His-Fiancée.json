I hope that the police will manage to arrest not only the killers, but also the person or people who ordered the murder.\u201d\nIt has long been suspected that Mr. Kuciak was shot to silence him. But the killings had the exact opposite effect.\nThey forced a spotlight on accusations that corruption had taken root in the highest ranks of the government in Slovakia, including in the office of the then prime minister, Robert Fico.\nTens of thousands of citizens, united in both grief and disgust, filled plazas in cities and towns across the country, week after week, in the largest demonstrations there since the Velvet Revolution in 1989 that led to Czechoslovakia breaking free from the grip of the Soviet Union.\nThe killing of Mr. Kuciak, who worked for Aktuality.sk, a news website, came less than six months after a car bomb killed another journalist, Daphne Caruana Galizia, in Malta. She had also been investigating government corruption.\nThe killing of journalists in Europe, coupled with nearly daily verbal assaults from nationalist leaders, has raised concerns across the Continent.\nMr. Fico was among those who did little to hide his disdain for the news media, referring to reporters as \u201cpresstitutes\u201d and \u201chyenas.\u201d\nBut as the street protests in Slovakia grew and anger swelled, Mr. Fico was eventually forced to step down.\nHe was replaced by Peter Pellegrini, who issued a statement on Thursday vowing to continue to hunt for all those responsible for the killings.\n\u201cI believe that this brutal act will continue to be investigated, its motive discovered and people who ordered it punished so it can stop dividing our society,\u201d Mr. Pellegrini said in a statement.\nDaniel Lipsic, lawyer for Mr. Kuciak\u2019s family, said in a statement that experts from various European Union countries were providing critical assistance in the case.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry that people in Slovakia are still very skeptical toward the security forces and judiciary, but I believe there are high-quality and ethical people in the police and prosecution, and a lot of them have worked on this case,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m also sure that the investigation has been independent thanks to the huge public pressure and the work of the media.\u201d\nThe sprawling investigation is one of the largest in the nation\u2019s history, Mr. Lipsic said, adding that he was confident that all those responsible would eventually face justice.\n\u201cIt is hard not to leave a single piece of electronic trail,\u201d he said, even if the killer was a professional.\nThe Slovak interior minister, Denisa Sakova, said that the police had interrogated more than 200 people and had commissioned dozens of reports from experts.\n\u201cThe investigation of the murder of Jan Kuciak and his fianc\u00e9e has been and always is my top priority,\u201d she said. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m very happy about the progress in the investigation, there is still a long road to the final judgment.\u201d\nMr. Kuciak\u2019s colleagues, joined by a collective of investigative journalists, have continued to pull on the threads of corrupt dealings he was working to expose, and in the months after his death, in addition to the prime minister, several other high-ranking officials have been forced to resign.\nPeter Bardy, Mr. Kuciak\u2019s editor at Aktuality.sk, said that the news of the arrests was encouraging.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they are trying to cover anything up, and I\u2019m sure they want to investigate the murder,\u201d he said.\nZuzana Petkova, an investigative reporter who worked with Mr. Kuciak and who is the director of a nongovernmental organization aimed at battling corruption, said she was also cautiously optimistic.\n\u201cAfter long weeks of frustration when we had no information about the progress of Jan Kuciak\u2019s murder investigation, we finally have some hope that it might be explained,\u201d she said.", "date": "Sept. 27, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/27/world/europe/slovakia-jan-kuciak-arrests.html", "tags": "arrested mr. \u201c fianc\u00e9e investigation slovakia killing suspects kuciak police also slovak journalist"}
