{"title": "Strong Hiring and Fed Chief\u2019s Reassurance on Rates Delight Investors", "content": "A blockbuster jobs report and reassuring comments from the Federal Reserve chairman reminded investors Friday to relish, at least for now, the economy\u2019s undeniable strengths.\nMarkets reacted buoyantly, after lurching for weeks over a faltering outlook at home and signs of a global slowdown.\nThe Labor Department report showed one of the strongest months of job gains in the last decade, with employers adding 312,000 to payrolls in December. Wages, which had been lagging until recently, showed impressive gains.\nJerome H. Powell, the Fed chief, cheered the report, while offering assurances that policymakers would not move quickly to raise interest rates. Investors had been concerned that additional rate increases would weigh on growth. \u201c2018, by so many measures, was a good year for the United States economy,\u201d he said at an economic conference in Atlanta.\nHe also sought to ease concerns about the stability of the central bank. When asked whether he would resign if President Trump asked him to, Mr. Powell simply said, \u201cNo.\u201d\nWall Street\u2019s enthusiastic response to the jobs numbers was magnified by Mr. Powell\u2019s comments. The S&P 500 index closed up more than 3 percent.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an unequivocally phenomenal report all the way around,\u201d said Ellen Zentner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley. \u201cAnyone that finds something negative in this report is simply cherry picking.\u201d\nEconomists offered raves that could appear on a movie poster or a book jacket \u2014 \u201cExtraordinary!\u201d \u201cBlowout,\u201d \u201cWow!\u201d The figures, they said, offer a resounding response to the question of whether a recession is imminent: \u201cNever mind!\u201d said David Berson, chief economist of Nationwide. \u201cThe fears of the economy tipping into a recession now have clearly been overstated.\u201d\nMr. Trump welcomed the stellar showing in televised remarks delivered in the White House Rose Garden. \u201c312,000 jobs was a tremendous number and obviously having a big impact on the stock market today,\u201d he said, adding that the pickup in wage growth was \u201cbeautiful to watch.\u201d\nBut the latest report comes in the context of flashing yellow lights elsewhere, which Mr. Powell acknowledged on Friday. There is an unresolved trade war with China, a nation already contending with an economic downturn that could dampen global demand. In the United States, there is a slump in the housing sector, with hints that the auto industry could be next.\nThis week, Apple cut its revenue forecast for the first time in 16 years, citing flagging iPhone sales in China. Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said on CNN that Apple would not be the only victim of tensions with Beijing.\n\u201cThere are a heck of a lot of U.S. companies that have a lot of sales in China that are basically going to be watching their earnings be downgraded next year until we get a deal with China,\u201d Mr. Hassett said.\nAnd on Thursday, the Institute for Supply Management released a survey showing the biggest drop in manufacturing activity since 2008. Many manufacturers blamed rising costs related to tariffs. (The index reading of 54.1 still showed an economy in expansion.) Measures of consumer confidence have also weakened recently.\nThe stock market has been in the midst of its worst decline since the financial crisis.\n\u201cWe\u2019re listening sensitively to the messages markets are sending,\u201d Mr. Powell said Friday. But investors, he said, \u201care way ahead of the data.\u201d\nIndeed, economists insist that there is more to celebrate than to fret over. In recent months, the unemployment rate has been hovering near a 50-year nadir. (The jobless rate rose last month, to 3.9 percent, but largely because new workers barreled into the labor force, suggesting that companies are luring stragglers back.) Job openings have hit record highs, and a growing number of workers are quitting, indicating confidence in their ability to find jobs.\nWages, which for months only inched up, have begun to pick up more quickly. December\u2019s year-over-year increase hit 3.2 percent, tying October for the biggest surge since 2009. The recovery has gone on for so long that it has finally begun to benefit the lowest-paid workers, who have seen the biggest pay gains.\nThe competition for employees has become excruciating for people like Michael Haith, the chief executive of Teriyaki Madness, a fast-casual Japanese food chain. The restaurant needs to staff 50 new locations next year, which means hiring up to 1,000 workers. That\u2019s not an easy feat in \u201ca brutal market\u201d for employers, Mr. Haith said.\nHe vies for workers with big brands like Burger King. Rival businesses have sent recruiters into Teriyaki Madness stores to poach his employees with offers of higher salaries. In Colorado, where the chain is based, he\u2019s also fending off marijuana farmers, who pay trimmers up to $17 an hour.\n\u201cGood employees can pretty much go wherever they want,\u201d Mr. Haith said. \u201cIt\u2019s really an arms race.\u201d His shops have increased wages by $1 or $2 an hour in the last year, just to keep up. He\u2019s not alone. Food-service workers nationwide got particularly big pay bumps last year, according to the latest federal data.\nMoves like that are part of what made 2018 \u201ca banner year for the labor market,\u201d said Julia Pollak, a labor economist at the employment site ZipRecruiter. And the 99-month streak of job gains could get even longer. There are still Americans who do not have jobs or are not clocking as many hours as they would like. The share of people who have part-time positions but would prefer to work full time is higher today than it was in 2007.\nAnd a far smaller share of the American population is working today than before the recession. That decline is partly because of the aging of the baby boom generation. But even among people in their prime working years, employment is down from before the recession, and far below its peak at the height of the dot-com boom.\n\u201cWe are not yet at maximum employment,\u201d Ms. Pollak said.\nOver all, employers added more jobs in 2018 than they did in 2017, at a monthly average of 220,000. But last year was unique, because Congress passed a big corporate tax cut that essentially bathed a sizzling economy in lighter fluid.\n\u201cPeople got used to these eye-popping job-growth numbers,\u201d said Martha Gimbel, director of research for the job-search site Indeed. Even if hiring slows in the coming months, she said, \u201cit doesn\u2019t mean that anything\u2019s wrong, it just means we are heading back to normal.\u201d\nBut investors have to weigh that interpretation \u2014 that the economy is peacefully drifting toward less exciting times \u2014 against the possibility that it is reeling toward calamity. It hasn\u2019t helped their mood (or Mr. Trump\u2019s) that the Fed decided to raise its target lending rate four times in 2018.\nAnd even Friday\u2019s stellar jobs numbers come with caveats. Each month\u2019s figures are revised twice, and provide snapshots of the past, not the future. December\u2019s report does not account for workers furloughed during the government shutdown, which began after last month\u2019s surveys were conducted.\nWall Street, of course, has the potential to create the bad news it seems to be anticipating. Concern over withering retirement funds could prompt Americans to tamp down on spending. And business owners might start to pull back on investments. That unholy feedback loop can begin to chip away at economic growth.\n\u201cWhen market sentiment has gotten this negative, investors aren\u2019t going to take one single data point and say: \u2018Oh, we were wrong! Things are just fine,\u2019\u201d Ms. Zentner said. She added that people might hesitate to put their full faith in the forecasts of economists. \u201cLook how right we were leading up to the financial crisis.\u201d", "date": "Jan. 4, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/business/economy/jobs-report.html", "tags": "reassurance delight fed hiring mr. rates report strong investors chief \u201d economy last year jobs workers"}
