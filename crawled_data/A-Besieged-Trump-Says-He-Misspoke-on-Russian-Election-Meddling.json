{"title": "A Besieged Trump Says He Misspoke on Russian Election Meddling", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Under unrelenting pressure from congressional Republicans, his own advisers and his allies on Fox News, President Trump abruptly reversed course on Tuesday and claimed he had misspoken during a news conference with President Vladimir V. Putin about whether Russia tried to influence the 2016 presidential election.\nMr. Trump, reading from a script, said he believed the assessment of the United States\u2019 intelligence agencies that Russia had interfered in the campaign after having seemed to have accepted Mr. Putin\u2019s assertion the day before that Russia was not involved.\nThe misunderstanding, he said, grew out of an unsuccessful attempt to use a double negative when he answered a question about whether he believed Mr. Putin or his intelligence agencies.\n\u201cMy people came to me,\u201d he said Monday in Helsinki, Finland. \u201cThey said they think it\u2019s Russia. I have President Putin; he just said it\u2019s not Russia. I will say this: I don\u2019t see any reason why it would be.\u201d\nOn Tuesday, he said that he had misspoken. \u201cThe sentence should have been, \u2018I don\u2019t see any reason why it wouldn\u2019t be Russia,\u2019 sort of a double negative,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cSo you can put that in, and I think that probably clarifies things pretty good.\u201d\nHe also insisted that he has \u201con numerous occasions noted our intelligence findings that Russians attempted to interfere in our elections.\u201d He did not mention the far greater number of occasions on which he has sown doubt about whether Russia meddled.\nMr. Trump also did not retract or explain his withering attack on the F.B.I. and the Justice Department for investigating his campaign\u2019s ties to Russia. He did not withdraw his assertion, standing next to Mr. Putin, that the Russian leader had offered an \u201cextremely strong and powerful\u201d denial of involvement during their two-and-a-half-hour meeting. And he did not amend his answer to a question about whether he believed Mr. Putin or officials like Dan Coats, his director of national intelligence.\nMr. Trump said there were \u201ctwo thoughts\u201d on the matter, and, \u201cI have confidence in both parties.\u201d\nBy nightfall, Mr. Trump appeared to regret the clarification, writing on Twitter that the \u201cmeeting between President Putin and myself was a great success, except in the Fake News Media!\u201d\nThe news conference on Tuesday was a hastily arranged, somewhat haphazard effort to defuse a sudden political crisis that had eclipsed the president\u2019s trip to Europe and his meetings with Mr. Putin and the leaders of NATO members and threatened to overwhelm the White House. Dozens of Republicans distanced themselves from the president\u2019s remarks; Democrats called for hearings; and some critics even suggested his conduct, on foreign soil, rose to the level of treason.\nAides said the episode reflected how the persistent questions about Mr. Trump\u2019s ties to Russia have all but paralyzed the president. Baffled by his solicitous tone toward Mr. Putin, some people close to Mr. Trump have concluded that he feels vulnerable to Mr. Putin, even if it is in his own mind, rather than because of any damaging information possessed by the Russians.\nEven as he walked back his remarks, Mr. Trump repeated his assertion that there was no evidence of collusion between his campaign and the Russians. That line was scribbled in black marker onto a typewritten sheet of remarks on the table before him.\nAnd he also seemed to undercut his own assertion that he had accepted the findings of Russian involvement.\n\u201cCould be other people also,\u201d Mr. Trump said, appearing to ad-lib. \u201cA lot of people out there.\u201d\nThat echoed his previous musings that the interference could have been carried out by China, a guy from New Jersey or \u201csomebody sitting on their bed who weighs 400 pounds.\u201d\nAs in other times Mr. Trump has ignited a furor \u2014 notably after his equivocal reaction to the violent attacks by white supremacists on left-wing activists in Charlottesville, Va. \u2014 his demeanor was at odds with the message he was ostensibly delivering.\nAt one point during his remarks, the TV lights in the Cabinet Room, where Mr. Trump was meeting with lawmakers, switched off, plunging the room into gloomy shadows. \u201cWhoops, they just turned off the lights,\u201d Mr. Trump joked. \u201cThat must be the intelligence agencies.\u201d\nBarely 24 hours earlier, the president had stood next to Mr. Putin under the glittering chandeliers of a ballroom in Helsinki, telling aides after the news conference wrapped up that he was happy with how it had gone. In an interview afterward with the Fox News host Sean Hannity, the president was upbeat, describing the meeting with Mr. Putin that preceded it as productive and speaking of a new era of cooperation with Russia.\nAs he flew home on Air Force One, however, Mr. Trump\u2019s mood darkened, according to aides. He watched coverage of himself on a flat-screen television hung above the leather sofas in his office. He read briefing papers, then looked back at the TV. He snapped at aides, complaining that the coverage was \u201cso negative.\u201d\nThe criticism came not just from Democrats or frequent Republican antagonists like Senator John McCain of Arizona. Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker and a staunch defender of the president, urged Mr. Trump to clarify his statements, which he described as \u201cthe most serious mistake of his presidency.\u201d\nSeveral Republicans who normally defend him on television were silent. Among them was Michael Anton, the former communications director for the National Security Council, who called off a long-planned appearance on CNN because he could not \u201cdefend\u201d how Mr. Trump had conducted himself with Mr. Putin, according to the host, Erin Burnett.\nMr. Trump\u2019s mood on Air Force One eventually got better, and he watched some of the Home Run Derby staged in Washington as part of the All-Star Game, according to another person briefed on what took place.\nBut by Tuesday morning, it was clear Mr. Trump could not rely on support from even his most die-hard allies. On \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d his favorite morning TV program, the host, Brian Kilmeade, spoke directly into the camera, as if assuming Mr. Trump was watching.\n\u201cFrom the day you came down the escalator, you shocked the world,\u201d Mr. Kilmeade said. \u201cFrom November, when everyone had you losing, you shocked the world. It wasn\u2019t because of Russia, but Russia\u2019s goal was to upend the electoral process. They hate democracy.\u201d\nHe referred to President John F. Kennedy, saying, \u201cKennedy would love to have undone his first meeting with Khrushchev,\u201d before delivering his pitch: \u201cThis is something that needs to be corrected.\u201d\nMr. Trump tweeted his gratitude to one of his only advocates, Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky. But he was uncharacteristically subdued, tweeting only three other times in the morning \u2014 one of them an anodyne comment about the health of the economy.\nHe insisted his meeting with Mr. Putin had gone \u201ceven better\u201d than that with NATO leaders, at which he claimed, erroneously, to have raised billions of dollars in additional funds for the alliance.\nMeanwhile, the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, showed the pressure Republicans were under to respond to Mr. Trump. After curtly telling reporters on Monday that Russia was not a friend of the United States, Mr. McConnell went further, warning that Congress would take measures against Russia if it continued to meddle.\n\u201cThe Russians need to know there are a lot of us who fully understand what happened in 2016,\u201d he said, \u201cand it better not happen in 2018.\u201d\nAt the White House, aides added their voices to the chorus of outsiders. The new communications director, Bill Shine, whose last job was running Fox News, has a particular ability to connect with the president. Aides said he was able to help persuade Mr. Trump that a change had to be made soon.\nThe chief of staff, John F. Kelly, was frustrated and urged people to talk to the president, according to two people familiar with the discussions. The more outside voices that Mr. Trump heard, his aides believed, the greater chance that he would agree to shift course.\nLater in the morning, Mr. Trump told aides he realized he needed to make a correction, according to the person who was briefed. His team met briefly to discuss what to say, and the speechwriter, Stephen Miller, drafted something that was rewritten several times. The vice president weighed in on it at one point before the president read his statement to reporters.\nFor days before his meeting in Helsinki, Mr. Trump\u2019s aides had cautioned him to be measured and careful in his exchanges with Mr. Putin. He and his advisers played down expectations for the meeting in conversations with Europeans. Aides said the donnybrook in Helsinki was less evidence of a plan by Mr. Trump to create chaos than a continuation of his missteps earlier in the trip.\nIn Britain, Mr. Trump gave an interview to a British tabloid, The Sun, as a favor to its proprietor, Rupert Murdoch. Speaking on the eve of his meeting with Prime Minister Theresa May, he praised Mrs. May\u2019s political nemesis, Boris Johnson, and condemned how she had handled the process of separating Britain from the European Union.\nMr. Trump appeared not to understand how explosive his words were until after he spoke to the newspaper. He was contrite when he saw Mrs. May, several people who witnessed their exchanges said. He had not planned to cause damage, but had done so, and it was hard to unwind it.\nNow, Mr. Trump\u2019s aides fear the worst is still to come. If the past is any guide, they said privately, Mr. Trump will spend the coming days digesting the continuing fallout from his encounter with Mr. Putin, and he will look for someone other than himself to blame.", "date": "July 17, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/17/world/europe/trump-putin-summit.html", "tags": "aides election meddling russian president putin \u201d trump meeting says russia misspoke besieged"}
