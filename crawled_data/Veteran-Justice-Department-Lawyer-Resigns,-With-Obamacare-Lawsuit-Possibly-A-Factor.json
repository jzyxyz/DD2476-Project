{"title": "Veteran Justice Department Lawyer Resigns, With Obamacare Lawsuit Possibly A Factor", "content": "A highly respected career lawyer at the Justice Department has decided to resign just days after the Trump administration backed a controversial lawsuit that would wreck part of the Affordable Care Act.\n Joel McElvain, outgoing assistant director of the federal programs branch, has spent more than 20 years at the department, much of it working on the biggest cases of the day. A former colleague described McElvain to HuffPost as a \u201creally good guy \u2014 the type who in any rational or just world would be at DOJ his entire career.\u201d\nAnother former colleague told The Washington Post, which was first to report the resignation,\u00a0that the news of McElvain\u2019s departure was a \u201cgut punch.\u201d\nAlthough McElvain has not publicly offered a reason for his resignation, the Post article said that his departure \u201chighlights internal frustration\u201d with the\u00a0Trump administration\u2019s\u00a0decision\u00a0to support a lawsuit from officials in 20 conservative states. That\u00a0lawsuit, now before a federal district judge in Texas, could wipe out key protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\u00a0\nInsurers could go back to screening customers for health status, as they did before the health care law took effect, charging higher premiums or denying coverage altogether to people who have histories of cancer, diabetes or even plain old allergies. \nThe defendant in the case is the U.S. government, because the Affordable Care Act is a federal law. Customarily, the Justice Department would file a brief arguing why the states are wrong, since it is part of the executive branch and defending federal statutes in court is part of the executive\u2019s constitutional duty to \u201ctake care that the laws be faithfully executed.\u201d \nBut Thursday, at the filing deadline for the case, the Justice Department submitted a brief that sided with the states.\u00a0\nThe brief was entirely consistent with President Donald Trump\u2019s long-standing hostility to the law, which President Barack Obama signed in 2010.\u00a0Trump and his Republican allies in Congress spent much of last year trying to repeal it. \nThat effort did not succeed, but as part of their 2017 tax cut, Republicans managed to zero out the law\u2019s individual mandate, which encourages healthy people to sign up for insurance by hitting them with a financial penalty if they don\u2019t. The Trump administration has also taken a series of executive actions,\u00a0such as slashing the Affordable Care Act\u2019s advertising budget, that have depressed enrollment or otherwise undermined it.\nBut none of that would compare to knocking out the protections for people with pre-existing conditions, as this new lawsuit could do.\u00a0\nIn fact, as Margot Sanger-Katz of The New York Times pointed out on Tuesday, eliminating coverage requirements for the pre-existing conditions could have all sorts of far-reaching effects, making it difficult, or perhaps even impossible, for the federal government to distribute tax credits that today help millions afford coverage.\u00a0\nThe Trump administration is not the first to drop the defense of a federal law.\u00a0But when past administrations have decided against defending a law, they have generally argued that a case raised highly important moral issues \u2015 or was clearly unconstitutional. \nThis is what the Obama administration argued in 2011 when it declined to defend the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which denied federal benefits to same-sex couples. The decision was controversial, with even some of the administration\u2019s own lawyers cautioning that it set a bad precedent. \nBut some experts supported the decision and, just two years later, the Supreme Court would invalidate DOMA as unconstitutional. \nIt\u2019s hard to find a respected legal expert today who finds merit in this latest lawsuit. The basis for the states\u2019 argument is that Congress originally intended for the pre-existing conditions protections to operate alongside the mandate; if the mandate is gone, the lawsuit reasons, then the pre-existing protections should go too.\nThe problem with this argument is that Congress last year made a clear decision to keep the protections but toss the mandate. The lawsuit essentially argues that this more recent action doesn\u2019t matter.\nLegal reasoning is always subjective, but even lawyers who enthusiastically supported other lawsuits challenging the Affordable Care Act\u2019s constitutionality have dismissed the case as nonsense. \nAnd it appears that some of the Justice Department\u2019s own career lawyers feel the same way. Right before the Trump administration filed its brief, siding with the conservative states, three career lawyers who were supposed to file it withdrew their names from the case,\u00a0offering an early hint that something was amiss.\nThree political appointees at Justice, along with one other career lawyer,\u00a0ended up signing onto the federal government\u2019s brief. In court, they will square off against lawyers from states more supportive of the law and who have agreed to defend it.\nMcElvain was one of those career Justice lawyers who withdrew from the case. And now he has decided to leave the department entirely.\nHe has not said publicly why he is leaving, and he has not responded to emails from media outlets, including HuffPost, which tried to contact him last week. But the circumstances and timing could indicate it is connected with the Affordable Care Act lawsuit.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s decision and, now, McElvain\u2019s departure have some experts worried about the future of the Justice Department, which historically has tried to insulate these sort of legal functions from partisanship and political meddling from above.\n\u201cJoel is a civil servant through and through \u2015 principled, dedicated to his country and nonpartisan,\u201d\u00a0Nicholas Bagley, who served at Justice from 2007 to 2010 and is now at the University of Michigan, told HuffPost. \u201cIf people like him are jumping ship, it\u2019s a troubling sign of institutional rot at the Justice Department.\u201d", "date": "\n06/13/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/justice-department-lawyer-resigns_n_5b2072ebe4b0bbb7a0e2ab06", "tags": "lawsuit administration mcelvain possibly obamacare department resigns veteran justice federal act factor law care lawyer"}
