{"title": "Fed Raises Interest Rates for Third Time Since Financial Crisis", "content": "The Federal Reserve, which raised its benchmark rate on Wednesday for the second time in three months, this time to a range between 0.75 percent and 1 percent, is finally moving toward the end of its nine-year-old economic stimulus campaign, which began in the depths of the financial crisis.\nBut Janet L. Yellen, the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, said at a news conference after the decision was announced that the Fed did not share the optimism of stock market investors and some business executives that economic growth is gaining speed. It still plans to move slowly because the economy continues to grow slowly. She suggested that the Fed would have plenty of time to adjust its plans should President Trump and Congress cut taxes or spend massively on infrastructure.\nHer announcement was full of confidence. But it certainly was not ebullient. \u201cThe data have not notably strengthened,\u201d Ms. Yellen told reporters. \u201cWe haven\u2019t changed the outlook. We think we\u2019re moving on the same course we\u2019ve been on.\u201d\nThe Fed said that the United States economy continued to chug along, expanding at a \u201cmoderate pace.\u201d Employers are hiring, consumers are spending and businesses \u2014 the laggards in recent months \u2014 are starting to plow a little more money into their operations, too.\nThe Fed\u2019s sobriety did not appear to make much of an impression on investors. The stock market\u2019s heady march that began after Mr. Trump\u2019s election continued apace. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index rose 0.84 percent to close at 2,385.26 Wednesday, moving up sharply after the announcement. Some said the Fed was still a long way from doing anything that might hurt.\n\u201cThe first four to eight rate hikes are the low-hanging fruit,\u201d said Deron McCoy, the chief investment officer at SEIA, a Los Angeles firm. \u201cThe real test will be whether the economy can withstand positive real rates. And that still seems to be a 2019 topic.\u201d\nSome analysts said the Fed will want to see an impact from its actions. \u201cPolicy makers hike rates to tighten financial conditions,\u201d said Ellen Zentner, the chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley. \u201cIf this easing of financial conditions on the back of today\u2019s hike are sustained, that would tell policy makers they need to do more.\u201d\nMs. Zentner said she expected the Fed to raise rates again at its June meeting. The Fed\u2019s policy-making committee next meets on May 2 and 3.\nShe noted that the Fed\u2019s longer-term outlook is less clear. Ms. Yellen\u2019s term as Fed chairwoman ends in February, and Mr. Trump could then replace her.\nThe Fed, charged with maximizing employment and moderating inflation, is close to achieving both goals. The unemployment rate fell to 4.7 percent in February, consistent with the normal churn of people moving among jobs. And after several years of concern that prices were not rising fast enough, inflation is reviving. The Fed\u2019s preferred measure rose 1.9 percent over the 12 months ending in January, close to its 2 percent annual target.\n\u201cThe basis for today\u2019s decision is simply our assessment of the progress of the economy,\u201d Ms. Yellen said at the postmeeting news conference. \u201cAnd it\u2019s been doing nicely.\u201d\nThe Fed, which had made more inflation a central objective, said on Wednesday that it was now focused on stabilizing inflation. Ms. Yellen took the opportunity to note that inflation may now rise a bit above 2 percent, just as it has been below 2 percent the last few years. \u201cIt\u2019s a reminder 2 percent is not a ceiling on inflation,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a target.\u201d\nThe Fed\u2019s increased confidence was reflected in a new round of policy forecasts it also published Wednesday. An increased number of Fed officials are expecting to raise rates at least twice more this year. Only three of the 17 officials who submitted forecasts expect the central bank to move more slowly. There was a similar coalescing around tighter policy for the following two years, marking the first time in recent years that the Fed\u2019s quarterly economic forecasts have shifted toward a prediction of tighter monetary policy.\nThis is the third time the Fed has raised rates since the financial crisis. The first hike came at the end of 2015 and the second almost exactly one year later. This time the Fed waited just three months. The benchmark rate remains below 1 percent, a very low level.\nPeople with credit card debt are likely to see an immediate increase of about a quarter percentage point in their interest rates. The effect on longer-term loans is less direct, but the average rate on a 30-year mortgage rose by half a percentage point over the last year.\nThe nation\u2019s largest borrower, the federal government, will also feel the pinch of higher rates. The Congressional Budget Office expects federal interest payments, measured as a share of the economy, to double over the next decade.\nSavers are unlikely to benefit immediately. Banks tend to raise interest rates on loans more quickly than they raise rates on deposits. Last week, the average rate on a six-month certificate of deposit was 0.14 percent. Last year at this time: 0.13 percent.\nThe Fed\u2019s move to raise rates puts it on course for a slow-motion collision with President Trump, who has repeatedly promised to increase economic growth through policies including cuts in taxation and regulation and more spending on infrastructure and defense.\nFed officials have emphasized that the economy is already growing at roughly its maximum sustainable pace; faster growth would therefore lead to faster increases in interest rates.\nSome economists and liberal activists argue that the Fed is raising rates too quickly. Narayana Kocherlakota, an economist at the University of Rochester and a former member of the Fed\u2019s policy-making committee, noted that strong economic growth continued to pull people into the job market while wage growth remained relatively weak. That suggests, he said, that the economy has not yet returned to full employment.\n\u201cWe should be seeing faster wage growth with this level of employment growth if we were close to full employment,\u201d Mr. Kocherlakota said on Twitter before the Fed\u2019s decision.\nMr. Kocherlakota\u2019s successor as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Neel Kashkari, cast the sole vote against raising rates on Wednesday.\nThe Fed\u2019s assessment of economic conditions remained quite measured. The economy expanded by just 1.6 percent in 2016, and there is little sign of an acceleration during the first quarter. Fed officials continue to forecast a Goldilocks economy, with the unemployment rate remaining at 4.5 percent and inflation around 2 percent for the next three years.\nMs. Yellen played down surveys showing a sharp rise in the optimism of consumers and business executives since the presidential election, noting there is little evidence that such surveys predict spending decisions.\nShe said that Fed officials spoke regularly to business leaders, and that many were undoubtedly in \u201ca much more optimistic frame of mind.\u201d But she added that many of those executives have adopted a wait-and-see attitude \u2014 just like the Fed itself.", "date": "March 15, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/15/business/economy/fed-interest-rates-yellen.html", "tags": "fed since percent rates \u201c growth raises financial economy interest third rate time crisis"}
