{"title": "Obama Administration Rushed to Preserve Intelligence of Russian Election Hacking", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 In the Obama administration\u2019s last days, some White House officials scrambled to spread information about Russian efforts to undermine the presidential election \u2014 and about possible contacts between associates of President-elect Donald J. Trump and Russians \u2014 across the government. Former American officials say they had two aims: to ensure that such meddling isn\u2019t duplicated in future American or European elections, and to leave a clear trail of intelligence for government investigators.\nAmerican allies, including the British and the Dutch, had provided information describing meetings in European cities between Russian officials \u2014 and others close to Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin \u2014 and associates of President-elect Trump, according to three former American officials who requested anonymity in discussing classified intelligence.\nSeparately, American intelligence agencies had intercepted communications of Russian officials, some of them within the Kremlin, discussing contacts with Trump associates.\nThe disclosures about the contacts came as new questions were raised about Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019s ties to the Russians. According to a former senior American official, he met with the Russian ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak, twice in the past year. The details of the meetings were not clear, but the contact appeared to contradict testimony Mr. Sessions provided Congress during his confirmation hearing in January when he said he \u201cdid not have communications with the Russians.\u201d\nMr. Sessions said in a statement late Wednesday that he \u201cnever met with any Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign.\u201d\n\u201cI have no idea what this allegation is about,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is false.\u201d\nMr. Trump has denied that his campaign had any contact with Russian officials, and at one point he openly suggested that American spy agencies had cooked up intelligence suggesting that the Russian government had tried to meddle in the presidential election. Mr. Trump has accused the Obama administration of hyping the Russia story line as a way to discredit his new administration.\nAt the Obama White House, Mr. Trump\u2019s statements stoked fears among some that intelligence could be covered up or destroyed \u2014 or its sources exposed \u2014 once power changed hands. What followed was a push to preserve the intelligence that underscored the deep anxiety with which the White House and American intelligence agencies had come to view the threat from Moscow.\nIt also reflected the suspicion among many in the Obama White House that the Trump campaign might have colluded with Russia on election email hacks \u2014 a suspicion that American officials say has not been confirmed. Former senior Obama administration officials said that none of the efforts were directed by Mr. Obama.\nSean Spicer, the Trump White House spokesman, said, \u201cThe only new piece of information that has come to light is that political appointees in the Obama administration have sought to create a false narrative to make an excuse for their own defeat in the election.\u201d He added, \u201cThere continues to be no there, there.\u201d\nAs Inauguration Day approached, Obama White House officials grew convinced that the intelligence was damning and that they needed to ensure that as many people as possible inside government could see it, even if people without security clearances could not. Some officials began asking specific questions at intelligence briefings, knowing the answers would be archived and could be easily unearthed by investigators \u2014 including the Senate Intelligence Committee, which in early January announced an inquiry into Russian efforts to influence the election.\nAt intelligence agencies, there was a push to process as much raw intelligence as possible into analyses, and to keep the reports at a relatively low classification level to ensure as wide a readership as possible across the government \u2014 and, in some cases, among European allies. This allowed the upload of as much intelligence as possible to Intellipedia, a secret wiki used by American analysts to share information.\nThere was also an effort to pass reports and other sensitive materials to Congress. In one instance, the State Department sent a cache of documents marked \u201csecret\u201d to Senator Benjamin Cardin of Maryland days before the Jan. 20 inauguration. The documents, detailing Russian efforts to intervene in elections worldwide, were sent in response to a request from Mr. Cardin, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, and were shared with Republicans on the panel.\n\u201cThis situation was serious, as is evident by President Obama\u2019s call for a review \u2014 and as is evident by the United States response,\u201d said Eric Schultz, a spokesman for Mr. Obama. \u201cWhen the intelligence community does that type of comprehensive review, it is standard practice that a significant amount of information would be compiled and documented.\u201d\nThe opposite happened with the most sensitive intelligence, including the names of sources and the identities of foreigners who were regularly monitored. Officials tightened the already small number of people who could access that information. They knew the information could not be kept from the new president or his top advisers, but wanted to narrow the number of people who might see the information, officials said.\nMore than a half-dozen current and former officials described various aspects of the effort to preserve and distribute the intelligence, and some said they were speaking to draw attention to the material and ensure proper investigation by Congress. All spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were discussing classified information, nearly all of which remains secret, making an independent public assessment of the competing Obama and Trump administration claims impossible.\nThe F.B.I. is conducting a wide-ranging counterintelligence investigation into Russia\u2019s meddling in the election, and is examining alleged links between Mr. Trump\u2019s associates and the Russian government. Separately, the House and Senate intelligence committees are conducting their own investigations, though they must rely on information collected by the F.B.I. and intelligence agencies.\nOn Wednesday, a Justice Department official confirmed that Mr. Sessions had two conversations with Ambassador Kislyak last year, when he was still a senator, despite testifying at his Jan. 10 confirmation hearing that he had no contact with the Russians. At that hearing, Mr. Sessions was asked what he would do if it turned out to be true that anyone affiliated with the Trump team had communicated with the Russian government in the course of the campaign. He said he was \u201cnot aware of any of those activities.\u201d\n\u201cI have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I didn\u2019t have \u2014 did not have communications with the Russians, and I\u2019m unable to comment on it,\u201d Mr. Sessions said at the time.\nHowever, Justice officials acknowledged that Mr. Sessions had spoken with Mr. Kislyak twice: once, among a group of ambassadors who approached him at a Heritage Foundation event during the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July and, separately, in an office meeting on Sept. 8. The contacts were first reported by The Washington Post.\nSarah Isgur Flores, Mr. Sessions\u2019s spokeswoman, said \u201cthere was absolutely nothing misleading about his answer\u201d because he did not communicate with the ambassador in his capacity as a Trump campaign surrogate. She said Mr. Sessions had at least 25 conversations in 2016 with ambassadors from a range of nations \u2014 including Britain, Japan, China, Germany and Russia \u2014 while on the Senate Armed Services Committee.\nThe revelation prompted congressional Democrats to issue a torrent of statements reiterating their demands that Mr. Sessions recuse himself from overseeing any investigation into Russia\u2019s contacts with the Trump campaign. So far, Mr. Sessions has demurred.\nRepresentative Adam B. Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement on Wednesday that if the reports about Mr. Sessions were accurate, \u201cit is essential that he recuse himself from any role in the investigation of Trump campaign ties to the Russians.\u201d Mr. Schiff added, \u201cThis is not even a close call; it is a must.\u201d\nRepresentative Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader of the House, called on Mr. Sessions to resign, saying on Twitter that \u201che is not fit to serve as the top law enforcement officer of our country.\u201d\nA White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, backed up Mr. Sessions late Wednesday, calling the accusations \u201cthe latest attack against the Trump administration by partisan Democrats.\u201d\nAt a CNN town hall on Wednesday, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said he did not know if there was anything between the Trump campaign and the Russians. But he added that if there was, \u201cit is clear to me that Jeff Sessions, who is my dear friend, cannot make this decision about Trump.\u201d\nAt his confirmation hearing on Wednesday, former Senator Dan Coats, Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for director of national intelligence, told the Senate Intelligence Committee that \u201cI think it\u2019s our responsibility to provide you access to all that you need.\u201d\nSome Obama White House officials had little faith that a Trump administration would make good on such pledges, and the efforts to preserve the intelligence continued until the administration\u2019s final hours. This was partly because intelligence was still being collected and analyzed, but it also reflected the sentiment among many administration officials that they had not recognized the scale of the Russian campaign until it was too late.\nThe warning signs had been building throughout the summer, but were far from clear. As WikiLeaks was pushing out emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee through online publication, American intelligence began picking up conversations in which Russian officials were discussing contacts with Trump associates, and European allies were starting to pass along information about people close to Mr. Trump meeting with Russians in the Netherlands, Britain and other countries.\nBut what was going on in the meetings was unclear to the officials, and the intercepted communications did little to clarify matters \u2014 the Russians, it appeared, were arguing about how far to go in interfering in the presidential election. What intensified the alarm at the Obama White House was a campaign of cyberattacks on state electoral systems in September, which led the administration to deliver a public accusation against the Russians in October.\nBut it wasn\u2019t until after the election, and after more intelligence had come in, that the administration began to grasp the scope of the suspected tampering and concluded that one goal of the campaign was to help tip the election in Mr. Trump\u2019s favor. In early December, Mr. Obama ordered the intelligence community to conduct a full assessment of the Russian campaign.\nIn the weeks before the assessment was released in January, the intelligence community combed through databases for an array of communications and other information \u2014 some of which was months old by then \u2014 and began producing reports that showed there were contacts during the campaign between Trump associates and Russian officials.\nThe nature of the contacts remains unknown. Several of Mr. Trump\u2019s associates have done business in Russia, and it is unclear if any of the contacts were related to business dealings.\nThe New York Times, citing four current and former officials, reported last month that the American authorities had obtained information of repeated contacts between Mr. Trump\u2019s associates and senior Russian intelligence officials. The White House has dismissed the story as false.\nSince the Feb. 14 article  appeared, more than a half-dozen officials have confirmed contacts of various kinds between Russians and Trump associates. The label \u201cintelligence official\u201d is not always cleanly applied in Russia, where ex-spies, oligarchs and government officials often report back to the intelligence services and elsewhere in the Kremlin.\nSteven L. Hall, the former head of Russia operations at the C.I.A., said that Mr. Putin was surrounded by a cast of characters, and that it was \u201cfair to say that a good number of them come from an intelligence or security background. Once an intel guy, always an intel guy in Russia.\u201d\nThe concerns about the contacts were cemented by a series of phone calls between Mr.  Kislyak and Michael T. Flynn, who had been poised to become Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser. The calls began on Dec. 29, shortly after Mr. Kislyak was summoned to the State Department and informed that, in retaliation for Russian election meddling, the United States was expelling 35 suspected Russian intelligence operatives and imposing other sanctions. Mr. Kislyak was irate and threatened a forceful Russia response, according to people familiar with the exchange.\nBut a day later, Mr. Putin said his government would not retaliate, prompting a Twitter post from Mr. Trump praising the Russian president \u2014 and puzzling Obama White House officials.\nOn Jan. 2, administration officials learned that Mr. Kislyak \u2014 after leaving the State Department meeting \u2014 called Mr. Flynn, and that the two talked multiple times in the 36 hours that followed. American intelligence agencies routinely wiretap the phones of Russian diplomats, and transcripts of the calls showed that Mr. Flynn urged the Russians not to respond, saying relations would improve once Mr. Trump was in office, according to multiple current and former officials.\nBeyond leaving a trail for investigators, the Obama administration also wanted to help European allies combat a threat that had caught the United States off guard. American intelligence agencies made it clear in the declassified version of the intelligence assessment released in January that they believed Russia intended to use its attacks on the United States as a template for more meddling. \u201cWe assess Moscow will apply lessons learned,\u201d the report said, \u201cto future influence efforts worldwide, including against U.S. allies.\u201d", "date": "March 1, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/01/us/politics/obama-trump-russia-election-hacking.html", "tags": "administration rushed intelligence election officials russian \u201d obama preserve hacking \u2014"}
