{"title": "Pentagon Builds Deterrent Force Against Possible Iranian Attack", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Pentagon will deploy a Patriot antimissile battery to the Middle East to shore up defenses against Iranian threats, part of a series of carefully calibrated deployments intended to deter attacks by Iranian forces or their proxies, Pentagon officials said on Friday.\nA single Patriot antimissile battery will return to the Persian Gulf, just a few months after four batteries were withdrawn from the region. The Pentagon also said it would replace one Navy ship in the region with a more capable vessel, the Arlington, an amphibious ship designed to carry Marines and combat helicopters.\n[To follow new military deployments to the Middle East, sign up for the weekly At War newsletter.]\nOfficials said the new deployments were part of the original request made last weekend by the military\u2019s Central Command after the Trump administration said new intelligence showed that Iran was mobilizing proxy groups in Iraq and Syria to attack American forces. As a result, the Pentagon sent B-52 bombers this week to Al Udeid air base in Qatar, and the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier passed through the Suez Canal on its way to the Persian Gulf.\nThe new steps are meant to be measured and limited, in part because a new intelligence analysis by American and allied spy services has concluded that the Iranian government, declining in popularity amid economic woes, is trying to provoke the United States into a military overreaction to cement its hold on power, according to American and allied intelligence officials. The American intelligence community has not yet done a broader official assessment that would incorporate views from multiple agencies.\nStill, divisions within the Trump administration are growing between officials advocating sharp limits on new military deployments and a more hawkish camp that believes the United States must be prepared for a larger-scale fight with Iran.\nMilitary planners were ordered this week to begin preparing for the possibility of a much larger deployment to the region in the event of a military conflict with Iran, two American officials said. Such plans would go well beyond the measured steps the Pentagon took this week.\nThose plans, which are in the very early stages, could ultimately call for tens of thousands of additional forces to be sent to the Middle East, the two officials said. Still, officials cautioned that the planning effort underway was extremely preliminary and did not envision a large-scale land operation against Iran.\nNevertheless, the planning effort is controversial within the military, officials said, especially because of the intelligence analysis suggesting that Tehran is trying to provoke an overreaction. Any large-scale deployment, officials noted, would run counter to President Trump\u2019s desire to reduce the overseas deployment of troops.\nThe new deployments, planning efforts and intelligence analysis came after the United States developed new information last weekend about Iran mobilizing its proxy forces. This week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that American intelligence had concluded that Iranian-sponsored attacks on United State forces \u201cwere imminent.\u201d\nAmerican and allied intelligence services intercepted communications between the Iranian government and its proxy forces that analysts have interpreted as encouraging attacks by Iranian-backed terrorist groups on American forces and bases in the Middle East.\nOn Friday, a Pentagon official said the United States had detected \u201canomalous naval activity\u201d by Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and commercial ships suspected of carrying missiles and other military hardware.\nThe new intelligence analysis said that President Hassan Rouhani of Iran believed that an attack by proxy forces, or the perception that those forces are preparing a strike, could prompt the United States to strike at an Iranian military target, such as a naval ship or a base, according to American and allied intelligence officials.\nThe Iranian strategy, the analysis said, is to prod the United States into a miscalculation or overreaction. American officials do not think Iran wants a war, or even a large-scale conflict. But a more limited strike by the United States could serve the Iranian strategy, the analysis said.\nIntelligence analyses and assessments in the Middle East have often been fraught, with a troubled record. And officials cautioned that any intelligence analysis that explores the motivations of adversaries is a particularly difficult endeavor. But officials noted that the assessment that Iran is trying to provoke the United States for its own political purposes is an important insight that could help the Trump administration avoid a needless escalation with Tehran.\nFor now, tension between Washington and Tehran continues to build, bolstered by angry rhetoric by politicians on both sides. Within the American government, John R. Bolton, the national security adviser, is seen as taking a hard line on Iran, dispatching his staff this week to deliver a message about the \u201congoing threat\u201d of Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions.\nMr. Trump has signaled a potentially softer line, however. On Thursday, he said of Iran\u2019s leaders that he \u201cwould like to see them call me,\u201d an invitation rejected the next day by a senior Iranian commander.\nSome senior members of the National Security Council met on Friday at midday to discuss Iran, according to two American officials. Some in the Defense Department have proposed offering humanitarian assistance to Iranian flood victims and a reduction of some sanctions in return for Iran ending support for Lebanese Hezbollah and the Houthi fighters in Yemen. The proposal is viewed skeptically by the N.S.C. staff, according to a senior administration official.\nIn part because of pressure from the United States and biting sanctions, the Iranian economy is faltering. And with runaway inflation, broad economic problems and labor unrest, the Iranian government believes its popularity is weakening, according to American and allied officials.\nAnimosity against the government is rising among Iranians, particularly among the middle class and entrepreneurs, who have been frustrated by support for proxy forces, feeling the country has gotten little for its overseas adventurism.\nMr. Rouhani believes his government\u2019s hold on power requires making the United States appear to be a military aggressor against Iran, according to American and allied intelligence officials.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s pressure campaign has proved effective at damaging the Iranian economy, said Elizabeth Rosenberg, an analyst with the Center for a New American Security. The Trump administration has shown it can use unilateral sanctions to weaponize the international banking system \u201cand cause a lot of pain.\u201d\n\u201cThere is a political need in Iran to respond to recent U.S. actions, which have had a serious impact in Iran and caused frustration and anger,\u201d she said. \u201cThe population needs to see them respond with a show of strength.\u201d\nStill, even if Tehran\u2019s strategy fails to either provoke the United States or rally international sympathy, merely sowing regional uncertainty could help Iran in other ways.\nIran may be secretly threatening attacks on the United States and publicly announcing an intention to withdraw from parts of the nuclear deal with the hope of driving up oil prices, current and former officials said in interviews this week.\nAs United States sanctions make it harder for Iran to sell as much oil, the higher prices make the oil it can sell or smuggle more valuable.\n\u201cThey want to earn as much as they can from every barrel they are able to export,\u201d said Ms. Rosenberg, a former senior Treasury Department official in the Obama administration. \u201cThe threat of hostilities has its own upward pressure on oil prices.\u201d\nSo far this month, oil prices have reacted far more to news of ups and downs of American trade negotiations with China than they have to tensions between Iran and the United States.\nCausing an international crisis, raising tensions and driving oil prices higher are also ways for Iran to show Mr. Trump the political cost of his pressure campaign, according to current and former officials. Mr. Trump has made clear the political importance he places on low oil prices, and the Iranian government is well aware of that, according to former officials.\nThe intelligence analysis has helped shape the military response. The number of military assets moved to the gulf \u2014 four bombers, an aircraft carrier and escort ships \u2014 is high profile enough to send a deterrent message but still relatively small. The Lincoln was already on its way to the region and simply cut short European port visits. The Arlington is a replacement for a similar, if less capable, ship.\nThe response also echoed a measured move by the Obama administration four years ago after the United States detected an Iranian arms shipment to some of Tehran\u2019s proxy forces. In April 2015, the Obama administration ordered the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt to move toward Yemen in a show of force to deter an Iranian shipment. That shipment was also thought to contain a ballistic missile or missile parts.", "date": "May 10, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/10/us/politics/us-iran-patriot-missile-battery.html", "tags": "possible iran american intelligence deterrent pentagon officials military forces builds united states force iranian attack"}
