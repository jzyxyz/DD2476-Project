{"title": "Barclays in talks to expand Dublin office post-Brexit", "content": "Barclays is in talks with Irish regulators about expanding its presence in Dublin in the run up to Brexit.\nIt is the latest financial company to indicate how it is repositioning to cope with the UK's exit from the EU. \nBarclays said Ireland provided a \"natural base\" for the bank as it has operated there for 40 years already.\n\"In the absence of certainty around... an agreement, we intend to take necessary steps to preserve ongoing market access for our customers.\"\nFinancial firms have been drawing up contingency plans for how they will continue to access the European single market when the UK leaves the trading bloc.\nCompanies in other sectors have also been making plans. Earlier on Friday, UK airline EasyJet said it was planning to set up a subsidiary in Austria.\nThe airline must have an air operator certificate in an EU member country to allow it to continue flying between member states after Brexit.\nBarclays currently employs about 100 staff in Dublin and the bank said it was talking to regulators over extending its licence there.\nIreland's Government Enterprise and Innovation Minister Frances Fitzgerald said Barclays' decision to expand its presence in Dublin was \"a strong vote of confidence in Ireland's growing importance as a gateway into the single market\".\nDublin appears to be well-placed in the race to pick up business from financial firms as they plan their post-Brexit strategies. \nIf financial firms based in the UK lose access to the European single market, they will need a subsidiary in another country within the EU to continue offering services across Europe.  \nInsurer Legal & General said in May that it planned to relocate parts of its business to the Irish capital. Standard Life is also thought to be likely to choose Dublin.\nUS bank JP Morgan is buying a Dublin office with space for 1,000 staff and its chief executive has also held a meeting with the Irish prime minister.\nJapan's Daiwa Securities, Sumitomo Mitsui and Nomura Holdings will set up subsidiaries in Frankfurt. Goldman Sachs and Standard Chartered are both also reported to be planning Frankfurt moves.\nDeutsche Bank has said it could move up to 4,000 jobs to Frankfurt and other EU locations.\nFrench banks such as Credit Agricole are more likely to move business to France, and HSBC has indicated it may also move staff to Paris.", "date": "14 July 2017", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-40610573", "tags": "office uk eu market dublin financial bank irish post-brexit expand barclays also talks"}
