{"title": "With Netanyahu Facing Indictment, Israel Braces for a Wild Election", "content": "JERUSALEM \u2014 Israelis were confronted with a rude new reality on Friday: a prime minister running for re-election while facing indictment for corruption.\nWhile there were hints that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could be losing support, his right-wing allies appeared to be sticking with him and no one was foolish enough to write off a politician who still retains a strong base and has shown Houdini-like skill in escaping seemingly impossible jams before.\nThe only certainty was that Israel was in for a wild ride between now and the April 9 ballot, with analysts predicting that the country\u2019s political scene \u2014 loud, fractious and heated at the best of times \u2014 would become only more divisive as Mr. Netanyahu, who is seeking a fourth consecutive term, fights for his political life.\n\u201cHe splits the nation,\u201d said Yehuda Ben Meir, an expert in public opinion at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv. \u201cHis are the politics of polarization and exaggeration. If he got any more polarizing he\u2019d fall off the planet.\u201d\n[The cases against Mr. Netanyahu, explained.]\nMr. Netanyahu, who has dominated the Israeli political scene for a decade, faces a serious challenge from a newcomer, Benny Gantz, a retired military chief and leader of the new, centrist Blue and White party.\nAfter the announcement by the attorney general, Avichai Mandelblit, on Thursday that he intends to indict Mr. Netanyahu on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust, polls have pointed to a growing shift away from Mr. Netanyahu and his conservative Likud party and toward Mr. Gantz, whose military record could inoculate him against Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s strongest line of attack, that he is the only one who can protect Israel\u2019s security.\nIsrael Hayom, the free newspaper sympathetic to Mr. Netanyahu and financed by Sheldon Adelson, the American casino billionaire and a longtime patron, buried its own poll in the Friday edition on page 19, after it put Blue and White a hefty nine seats ahead of Likud.\nIf anything, experts said, Israel Hayom\u2019s polls have tended to be skewed in Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s favor.\nStill, it may be premature to measure the political effect of the attorney general\u2019s announcement.\n\u201cIt\u2019s too early for the polls to matter,\u201d Mr. Ben Meir said. \u201cIt takes time for people to react.\u201d\nThe details of three separate, but interconnected, corruption cases in which Mr. Netanyahu is a suspect were spread over a 57-page document released by the Justice Ministry on Thursday.\nIt included a chart with a monthly breakdown of the hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of cigars and Champagne supplied to the Netanyahus by a Hollywood producer and a millionaire businessman; back-room dealings with the publisher of a rival newspaper, Yediot Ahronot; and a dinner with an Israeli telecommunications mogul that led to a yearslong \u201cgive and take\u201d relationship, as Mr. Mandelblit put it, with Mr. Netanyahu allegedly exchanging lucrative regulatory favors for positive coverage.\nBut a deluge of leaks from the investigations over the past few months meant that for most Israelis, there was little shock value in the official revelations.\nMr. Netanyahu, who denies any wrongdoing, went about his business as usual on Friday, hosting the president of Liberia, a former professional soccer player. \u201cI told him that the next time he came we might play some football,\u201d a seemingly jovial and relaxed Mr. Netanyahu said in a video.\nHe also kept up his political invective, urging his supporters on Twitter, \u201cDo not let the witch hunt against me confuse you.\u201d Returning to a familiar theme, he denounced Mr. Gantz and his party as the \u201cweak left\u201d and said it would have to rely on the support of Arab parties to prevent a right-wing coalition.\nIn the morning, public radio moved on from the investigations to discuss the problem of traumatized Israeli war veterans. People shopped for the sabbath.\nThere was no reason to panic with the election still nearly 40 days off.\n\u201cForty days in an election season is the equivalent of two years in normal time,\u201d wrote Amit Segal, an Israeli political analyst, in his weekly column in Friday\u2019s Yediot Ahronot newspaper. \u201cUntil then, the agenda should change several times.\u201d\n\u201cNo one\u2019s jaw dropped yesterday,\u201d he added, quoting the words of a popular Israeli song, \u201cLovers will love, haters will hate.\u201d\nOpposition leaders have called on Mr. Netanyahu to resign, and so far, his right-wing allies appeared to still see him as their best bet to return to government. Most of his current coalition partners, and even a would-be successor within his Likud party, issued statements of support, saying the prime minister, like anybody else, deserved to be treated as innocent until proven guilty.\nAyelet Frish, a former strategic consultant for Shimon Peres, said there was a perceptible shift among some of the \u201csoft right\u201d away from Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s Likud to other parties. Whether they return home by April, she said, largely depends on Mr. Netanyahu.\n\u201cNetanyahu is a champion at the negative campaign,\u201d she said, \u201cbut it takes time to penetrate. We will have to wait until a minute before the elections.\u201d\nIn the 2015 election, Mr. Netanyahu was widely believed to have ensured a last-minute victory by scaring Jewish voters with a video demonizing Arab voters, saying left-wingers were busing them to the voting booths \u201cin droves.\u201d Palestinian-Arab citizens make up more than 20 percent of Israel\u2019s population.\nThe announcement on Thursday was an interim step in the prosecution. Mr. Netanyahu is now entitled to a hearing to challenge the charges before a formal indictment can be handed down.\nHe insists that the hearing could overturn the attorney general\u2019s decision and quash the cases against him, but his lawyers will need at least six months to prepare, experts say, and it is unlikely to take place before the election.\nIsraeli criminal lawyers say that while the hearings often end in reduced charges or closed cases, that was unlikely in Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s case. The investigation was closely supervised by the highest legal authorities and Mr. Mandelblit\u2019s charges were conservative. He recommended the most serious charge, bribery, in only one case, while the state attorney\u2019s office recommended bribery charges in all three.\nThat makes a formal indictment all but certain. Whether Mr. Netanyahu will still be prime minister by then is not.", "date": "March 1, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/01/world/middleeast/netanyahu-indictment-election.html", "tags": "election braces indictment wild political israel facing \u201d charges netanyahu israeli still"}
