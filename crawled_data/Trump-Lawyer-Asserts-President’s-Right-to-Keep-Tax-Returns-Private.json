{"title": "Trump Lawyer Asserts President\u2019s Right to Keep Tax Returns Private", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer on Friday asserted Mr. Trump\u2019s right as a citizen to keep his tax returns private and told the Treasury Department not to hand the returns over to House Democrats, foreshadowing what has the potential to be a far-reaching legal fight that could reach the Supreme Court.\nThe lawyer, William S. Consovoy, argued that Democrats who have demanded to see Mr. Trump\u2019s tax information had no legitimate legislative reason to request it and that Representative Richard E. Neal\u2019s decision this week to ask for six years of the president\u2019s personal and business returns flouts \u201cfundamental constitutional constraints.\u201d He also called it a \u201cgross abuse of power.\u201d\n\u201cEven if Ways and Means had a legitimate committee purpose for requesting the president\u2019s tax returns and return information, that purpose is not driving Chairman Neal\u2019s request,\u201d the lawyer wrote, referring to Mr. Neal, Democrat of Massachusetts, who leads the House Ways and Means Committee. \u201cHis request is a transparent effort by one political party to harass an official from the other party because they dislike his politics and speech.\u201d\n[Read the lawyer\u2019s letter.]\nMr. Consovoy\u2019s views have no direct bearing on the case. The little known tax code provision employed by the Democrats in demanding Mr. Trump\u2019s returns says only that the Internal Revenue Service \u201cshall furnish\u201d the information, giving it and its parent agency, the Treasury Department, little leeway in deciding how to respond.\nDemocrats anticipate that the Trump administration could present an argument similar to the one made on Friday by Mr. Consovoy, namely that Mr. Neal\u2019s request lacks a legitimate legislative purpose and, based on past court precedent, must respect Mr. Trump\u2019s right to privacy.\nNonetheless, the length and forcefulness of Mr. Consovoy\u2019s letter underscores what is at stake for a president who has defied modern political norms by refusing to voluntarily release his tax returns. If Mr. Neal prevails and gains access to the president\u2019s long-hidden returns, it would allow Democrats for the first time to peek past Mr. Trump\u2019s public claims about his wealth and investments and into the heart of his personal and business finances.\nThe I.R.S. and Treasury Department have given no indication of how they view the request since it was made on Wednesday. Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, told Congress last month he would consult with his legal team and follow the law when a request was made. He will most likely face questions about the request again next week when he returns to Capitol Hill to discuss the department\u2019s budget.\nMr. Trump has indicated in recent days that he is ready to fight to keep his financial information private. Asked on Friday if he was confident he would succeed, Mr. Trump offered an ambiguous prediction.\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s up to whoever handles it. I don\u2019t know. Hey, I\u2019m under audit. But that\u2019s up to whoever it is. From what I understand, the law is 100 percent on my side.\u201d\nMr. Neal made the request through an obscure but frequently used provision of the federal tax code \u2014 Section 6103 \u2014 that allows Congress\u2019s tax-writing committees to view tax information on any filer. The authority is regularly used by the committee to confidentially measure how changes to the tax code would affect different types of taxpayers. It has been used for more investigative purposes, as well, most recently in 2014, when committee Republicans obtained and publicly released tax information as part of an investigation into whether the I.R.S. discriminated against conservative entities seeking tax-exempt status.\nBut there is little precedent for using it to examine the returns of a president without his consent.\nMr. Neal gave the I.R.S. until next week to comply. If it does not, the House could go to court to try to enforce the request \u2014 a process that legal experts said could take years to sort out. \n\u201cThe Supreme Court has flagged twice now that it is unclear as to whether a congressional committee can sue the president and force the executive branch to do something,\u201d said Andy Grewal, a University of Iowa law school professor. \u201cI think we are a very long way from getting an answer over legitimate legislative purpose.\u201d\nAfter months of speculation, the back-and-forth was initiated on Wednesday when Mr. Neal formally requested that the I.R.S. hand over six years of Mr. Trump\u2019s personal and business tax returns as part of what he said was a committee oversight investigation of tax law enforcement. Even if Mr. Neal does get access to the information, it would not automatically become public because the committee would have to vote to disclose anything it sees.\nIn making his request, Mr. Neal jettisoned issues, like possible tax fraud, that Democrats have warned that Mr. Trump may be hiding, instead saying that he wanted to examine audit procedures for a president.\nMr. Neal worked closely with House lawyers to prepare the request to hold up against legal challenge. He framed the request as part of the Ways and Means Committee\u2019s oversight of \u201cthe extent to which the I.R.S. audits and enforces the federal tax laws against a president.\u201d Under I.R.S. policy, the personal tax returns of presidents and vice presidents are supposed to be automatically audited each year.\n\u201cThis request is about policy, not politics,\u201d Mr. Neal said at the time. \u201cMy preparations were made on my own track and timeline, entirely independent of other activities in Congress and the administration.\u201d\nDaniel Rubin, a spokesman for Mr. Neal, declined to comment on Friday\u2019s letter.\nMr. Consovoy said that Mr. Neal\u2019s stated justification only thinly veiled what Democrats were really after: political gain. They have demanded for years that Mr. Trump release his tax returns, Mr. Consovoy argued, and they promised to use the House majority to find out whether the president had undertaken financial fraud.\n\u201cOnce this Pandora\u2019s box is opened, the ensuing tit for tat will do lasting damage to our nation,\u201d Mr. Consovoy wrote.\nThough he was defending Mr. Trump\u2019s privacy rights as a taxpayer, his arguments also closely mirrored those used by Republicans in Congress who have argued against making the request.\n\u201cIf Chairman Neal genuinely wants to review how the I.R.S. audits presidents, why is he seeking tax returns and return information covering the four years before President Trump took office?\u201d Mr. Consovoy asked. \u201cWhy is he not requesting information about the audits of previous presidents?\u201d\nMr. Consovoy\u2019s argument bears similarity to one made by other Trump lawyers throughout the course of the obstruction of justice investigation led by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. In that case, the president\u2019s lawyers repeatedly argued that he did not lose his rights as a citizen by dint of being the commander in chief. Those included his rights to free speech, his lawyers argued, a point echoed in the letter sent on Friday.\nMr. Grewal said he thought Mr. Consovoy raised a valid objection about the legitimacy of Mr. Neal\u2019s investigation, but cautioned that his letter was \u201cpart of public relations and advocacy, as opposed to any kind of official action\u201d that would affect the case.\nGeorge K. Yin, a tax law professor at the University of Virginia, disagreed. He said Mr. Neal\u2019s argument was cleverly framed, particularly in light of a relevant past use of Section 6103 by Congress in examining whether President Richard M. Nixon had properly paid his taxes.\n\u201cThere is an inherent conflict of interest when the agency is responsible for auditing its boss,\u201d he said.\nFacing questions about his own tax obligations, Nixon asked Congress to investigate whether he had taken improper tax positions as president. Using materials he handed over and referencing Section 6103, Congress found that despite being audited by the I.R.S., Nixon had significantly underpaid.\nAfter Nixon and his immediate successor, Gerald R. Ford, all American presidents until Mr. Trump voluntarily released their taxes.", "date": "April 5, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/05/us/politics/trump-tax-returns.html", "tags": "asserts tax president \u201d trump keep returns request consovoy right neal private lawyer"}
