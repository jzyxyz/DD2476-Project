{"title": "Bruce Springsteen Cancels North Carolina Concert Over Anti-LGBT Law", "content": "North Carolina\u2019s controversial new anti-LGBT law\u00a0doesn\u2019t sit well with Bruce Springsteen.\u00a0\nThe Boss, 66, has been thrilling audiences across the country on The River Tour with his E Street Band since the start of the year. Although he and his bandmates had been slated to perform at the Greensboro Coliseum on April 10, Springsteen announced Friday that he was canceling the show following North Carolina\u2019s passage of House Bill 2, or HB2, last month.\u00a0\nSpringsteen blasted the new legislation, which Gov. Pat McCrory signed into law March 23, in a lengthy statement on his official website April 8.\u00a0\n\u201cHB2 \u2014 known officially as the Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act \u2014 dictates which bathrooms transgender people are permitted to use,\u201d Springsteen wrote in the statement. \u201cJust as important, the law also attacks the rights of LGBT citizens to sue when their human rights are violated in the workplace. No other group of North Carolinians faces such a burden.\u201d\nCalling the law \u201can attempt by people who cannot stand the progress our country has made in recognizing the human rights of all of our citizens to overturn that progress,\u201d he added, \u201cSome things are more important than a rock show and this fight against prejudice and bigotry \u2014 which is happening as I write \u2014 is one of them.\u201d\nCanceling the concert, he said, is \u201cthe strongest means I have for raising my voice in opposition to those who continue to push us backwards instead of forwards.\u201d\nAccording to Springsteen\u2019s website, all tickets for the April 10 concert will be refunded at point of purchase. No word on whether or not he\u2019ll return to the Tar Heel state in the future.\u00a0\nThe legendary rocker is the latest to join a growing chorus of celebrities and public figures who\u2019ve spoken out against HB2. On April 3, basketball legend Charles Barkley cited the law when he called for the NBA to relocate its 2017 All-Star Game, which is slated to take place in Charlotte, in an interview with CNN. \u00a0\nMeanwhile, stage and screen composer Stephen Schwartz has said he\u2019ll deny the production rights to his Broadway musicals, including \u201cWicked,\u201d to all North Carolina-based theaters and performing arts groups until the law is repealed.\u00a0\nJust further proof that they don\u2019t call Springsteen \u201cThe Boss\u201d for nothing.\u00a0", "date": "\n04/08/2016", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bruce-springsteen-north-carolina_n_5707f503e4b04bf520ff674a", "tags": "anti-lgbt springsteen rights cancels \u201d carolina \u2014 new bruce april north law concert"}
