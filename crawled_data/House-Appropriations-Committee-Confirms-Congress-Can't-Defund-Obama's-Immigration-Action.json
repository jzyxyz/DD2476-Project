{"title": "House Appropriations Committee Confirms Congress Can't Defund Obama's Immigration Action", "content": "\nWASHINGTON -- The House Appropriations Committee confirmed Thursday what some people are already figuring out: Republicans don't have the ability to defund President Barack Obama's forthcoming executive action on immigration.\nObama is expected to announce Thursday night that he will use his executive authority to stop deportations for as many as 5 million undocumented immigrants. Republicans have fumed about the president going around Congress to make such a significant change and vowed to cut off funding for it. Some have even threatened to shut down the government in protest.\nBut lawmakers can't cut off funding for Obama's action because the agency responsible for carrying out the changes is completely self-funded, the House Appropriations Committee explained in a statement:\nThe president's decision to take unilateral action comes in response to Congress' failure to pass comprehensive immigration reform. The Senate passed a bipartisan bill more than a year ago, but House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) has refused to give it a vote, leaving the issue on track to stall out at the end of the year.\nWhile many Republicans have said they want to block the president's executive action, they haven't been able to explain how, exactly, they would go about doing it. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), for one, has said he has no idea how an effort to cut off funding would work.", "date": "\n11/20/2014", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/defund-obama-immigration-action_n_6191958", "tags": "funding appropriations defund immigration ca confirms committee cut house obama republicans executive action congress"}
