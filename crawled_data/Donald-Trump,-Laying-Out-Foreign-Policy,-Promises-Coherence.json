{"title": "Donald Trump, Laying Out Foreign Policy, Promises Coherence", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Donald J. Trump, exuding confidence after his resounding primary victories in the East, promised a foreign policy on Wednesday that he said would put \u201cAmerica first.\u201d He castigated President Obama and Hillary Clinton, a former secretary of state and a possible opponent in the general election, for what he described as a string of missteps that have disillusioned the nation\u2019s allies and emboldened its rivals.\nMr. Trump, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, pledged a major buildup of the military, the swift destruction of the Islamic State and the rejection of trade deals that he said tied the nation\u2019s hands. But he also pointedly rejected the nation-building of the George W. Bush administration, reminding his audience that he had opposed the Iraq war.\n\u201cAmerica is going to be strong again; America is going to be great again; it\u2019s going to be a friend again,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to finally have a coherent foreign policy, based on American interests and the shared interests of our allies.\u201d\n\u201cThe world must know that we do not go abroad in search of enemies, that we are always happy when old enemies become friends and when old friends become allies,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s what we want: We want to bring peace to the world.\u201d\nFor Mr. Trump, whose campaign appearances are often a gleeful exercise in showmanship and off-the-cuff wisecracks, the speech had all the trappings of a serious address. Standing beneath a twinkling chandelier in a Washington hotel ballroom, backed by American flags and facing a sedate, largely gray-haired audience, a measured Mr. Trump read his remarks from a teleprompter, staying almost completely on script.\nBut if Mr. Trump adopted establishment trappings, his speech still had an insurgent tone. He criticized allies in Europe and Asia for not bearing the burden of their own defense, he said he would try to mend fences with Russia, and he assailed his opponents for being overly aggressive in foreign affairs. Mr. Trump said he had no plans to take advice from the foreign policy elite, and his agenda reflected that \u2014 a m\u00e9lange of ideas that defied Republican and Democratic orthodoxy.\nThere were paradoxes throughout Mr. Trump\u2019s speech. He called for a return to the coherence of America\u2019s foreign policy during the Cold War. Yet he was openly suspicious of the institutions that undergirded that era. He promised to eradicate the Islamic State, but said the campaign against extremism \u2014 or as he called it, \u201cradical Islam\u201d \u2014 was as much a philosophical struggle as a military one.\n\u201cOur friends and enemies must know that if I draw a line in the sand, I will enforce that line in the sand \u2014 believe me,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cHowever, unlike other candidates for the presidency, foreign aggression will not be my first instinct.\u201d He did not mention anyone by name, though his strongest Republican opponent, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, has threatened to carpet-bomb the Islamic State until the desert sand glows.\nMr. Trump\u2019s speech drew negative reaction across the political spectrum. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, posted on Twitter that \u201cRonald Reagan must be rolling over in his grave.\u201d Lanhee Chen, a fellow at the Hoover Institution who advised Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, said \u201cThere was clearly an isolationist strain to the speech, but that runs into the reality of the world that we live in.\u201d\nR. Nicholas Burns, a former senior State Department official under Mr. Bush who now advises Mrs. Clinton, said, \u201cHe\u2019s casting these thunderbolts and threats at our allies, and yet there was almost a kid-glove treatment of Russia and China.\u201d\nEven Mr. Trump\u2019s embrace of the slogan \u201cAmerica first\u201d raised eyebrows, with critics noting that it was popularized in the 1930s by the aviator Charles A. Lindbergh and other isolationists who opposed the United States\u2019 entering World War II. \u201cTo fly the banner of America First shows that he has historical amnesia or just doesn\u2019t understand history,\u201d Mr. Burns said.\nIn one of his few concrete proposals, Mr. Trump said he would convene summit meetings in Europe and Asia to overhaul NATO and rebalance nuclear security arrangements with Japan and South Korea. He did not repeat a statement he made to The New York Times that those countries should consider acquiring their own nuclear weapons.\nMr. Trump was scathing about the Obama administration\u2019s intervention in Libya, lashing Mrs. Clinton to the policy, which he said had left a security vacuum filled by the Islamic State. He also faulted Mr. Obama for his failure to enforce the red line he laid down in Syria. Yet Mr. Trump made clear he would use military force only as a last resort.\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting out of the nation-building business and instead focusing on creating stability on the world,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\nOn pressing issues like counterterrorism, Mr. Trump broke little new ground. He declined, for example, to give any details on how he planned to destroy the Islamic State to avoid tipping the military\u2019s hand, beyond vowing that \u201cthey will be gone quickly.\u201d\nMr. Trump repeated his desire to seek improved relations with Russia and its president, Vladimir V. Putin \u2014 a strategy that carried echoes of Mr. Obama\u2019s attempt to \u201creset\u201d relations with Russia after its invasion of Georgia in 2008. But he said his skills as a deal maker would make him more successful at it.\n\u201cI see improved relations with Russia, from a position of strength, as possible,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cSome say the Russians won\u2019t be reasonable; I intend to find out.\u201d\nIn another echo of Mr. Obama, Mr. Trump said he would seek advice from outside the foreign policy establishment. He said he would choose \u201cthe best minds\u201d with practical solutions, rather than people with \u201cperfect r\u00e9sum\u00e9s\u201d and records of failure around the world. He did not mention any names.\nMr. Trump promised to make the United States more dependable in the eye of its friends and allies, and more respected by its enemies. Yet just moments earlier, he also advocated increased unpredictability. \u201cWe have to be unpredictable,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we have to be unpredictable starting now.\u201d\nThe relatively small, invitation-only crowd consisted of journalists (seated in the back), and seven rows of guests \u2014 a largely inside-the-Beltway crowd that included Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, a senior policy adviser to the campaign; a handful of House members; and Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform.\nMr. Trump recently overhauled his campaign team, bringing in new advisers who have begun to impose discipline and organization to what was often a chaotic campaign. The candidate himself has taken steps toward \u201cmore presidential\u201d behavior, as he calls it.\nMr. Trump, who delights in mocking scripted candidates who use teleprompters, delivered his speech with the help of two teleprompters, and aides said he had practiced with them over the weekend. The New York billionaire worked on his foreign policy speech for more than a week, according to an aide, with the help of some advisers his campaign would not identify.\n\u201cThe speech is his words and his thoughts,\u201d said Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump\u2019s newly installed campaign chief.\nMr. Trump was introduced by Zalmay Khalilzad, an Afghan-born diplomat who was Mr. Bush\u2019s ambassador to Afghanistan and Iraq, and is closely identified with the American wars in those countries. Mr. Khalilzad said afterward that he was not advising Mr. Trump formally or informally, and that the two men met for the first time in a holding room adjacent to where he delivered his speech.", "date": "April 27, 2016", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/28/us/politics/donald-trump-foreign-policy-speech.html", "tags": "policy laying speech \u201d trump donald promises foreign \u2014 coherence"}
