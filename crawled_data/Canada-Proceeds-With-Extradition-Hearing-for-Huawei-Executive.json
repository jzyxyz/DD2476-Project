{"title": "Canada Proceeds With Extradition Hearing for Huawei Executive", "content": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia \u2014 Canada\u2019s Department of Justice on Friday authorized an extradition hearing for a top executive of Huawei, the Chinese electronics giant, who is wanted on fraud charges in the United States.\nThe case involving the executive, Meng Wanzhou, who is the chief financial officer and daughter of Huawei\u2019s founder, has entangled Canada in a bitter dispute between the world\u2019s two largest economies.\nOn Dec. 1 Canadian police officers arrested Ms. Meng at the request of the United States, infuriating China. In January, the United States unveiled an indictment  against Ms. Meng and Huawei, outlining what it said were the company\u2019s efforts stretching over many years to steal trade secrets, obstruct a criminal investigation and evade American economic sanctions on Iran.\nMs. Meng\u2019s detention has created a rift in Chinese-Canadian relations. China detained several Canadians and sentenced a Canadian drug smuggler to death in what many in Canada viewed as retaliation.\nIn a statement, Justice Department officials \u201cissued an authority to proceed, formally commencing an extradition process in the case of Ms. Meng Wanzhou.\u201d\nThe department said that the decision followed its review of evidence in the case, and that it had been satisfied there was sufficient evidence to proceed.\nIn its statement, the department stressed that the extradition hearing, which will begin at British Columbia\u2019s Supreme Court on March 6, \u201cis not a trial, nor does it render a verdict of guilt or innocence.\u201d\nRather, legal experts said, the court\u2019s role in such cases is circumscribed, and includes determining whether the fraud accusations against Ms. Meng by the United States constitute a crime in Canada.\n\u201cThe conduct for which extradition is sought must also be considered criminal in both the United States of America and in Canada,\u201d the department said.\nDavid Martin, Ms. Meng\u2019s lawyer, said on Friday that he was disappointed by the decision, calling the charges politically motivated.\n\u201cOur client maintains that she is innocent of any wrongdoing and that the U.S. prosecution and extradition constitutes an abuse of the processes of law,\u201d Mr. Martin said in a statement.\nHis statement also referred to \u201cthe political nature of the U.S. charges\u201d and to President Trump\u2019s stated willingness to intercede in the case if it would help secure a trade deal between the United States and China.\nAlso, apparently alluding to the fact that violating United States sanctions on Iran is not a crime under Canadian law, Mr. Martin expressed concern that the \u201cconduct alleged to be an offense in the U.S. would not be an offense in Canada.\u201d\n[Want more Canadian coverage in your inbox?

She must wear a GPS tracking device around her ankle.\nAssuming an extradition request clears the court, the matter would be referred to the country\u2019s recently appointed justice minister, David Lametti, a former law professor at McGill University in Montreal who specialized in intellectual property.\nHuawei has a notable presence in Canada, including research centers in Vancouver, Ottawa, Montreal, and Waterloo, Ontario. It employs about 1,100 people in the country.\nAs Huawei fights the extradition case, it has been undertaking a major public relations campaign.\nThis week it published full-page advertisements in several newspapers in the United States, inviting journalists to visit its centers and interview employees under the title: \u201cDon\u2019t believe everything you hear. Come and See Us.\u201d\nThe company has also been trying to burnish its image in Canada where, among other things, it sponsors Hockey Night in Canada, a weekly ritual for many Canadians.\nThe Canadian government is under pressure from the United States government to ban Huawei equipment from coming improvements to Canada\u2019s wireless networks. American security agencies have expressed concern that Huawei gear can be turned into spy equipment for China, although they have offered no proof publicly to support those claims.\nWith Ms. Meng\u2019s extradition still pending, two Huawei subsidiaries pleaded not guilty on Thursday to fraud, trade secrets conspiracy and other charges in Seattle. A trial date was set for March 2020.\nBoth the Seattle case and the extradition case involve charges by American officials that the company stole part of a smartphone testing robot known as Tappy from a T-Mobile lab in Bellevue, Wash., sometime before 2014.", "date": "March 1, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/01/world/canada/huawei-meng-wanzhou-extradition.html", "tags": "extradition hearing executive \u201c united case states ms. huawei meng canada proceeds"}
