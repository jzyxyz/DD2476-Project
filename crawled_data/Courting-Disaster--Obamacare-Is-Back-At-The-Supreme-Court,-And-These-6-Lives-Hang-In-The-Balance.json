{"title": "Courting Disaster- Obamacare Is Back At The Supreme Court, And These 6 Lives Hang In The Balance", "content": "King v. Burwell, a lawsuit that originated in conservative and libertarian think tanks, alleges that a stray phrase in the Affordable Care Act -- \u201can exchange established by the state\u201d -- means the federal government isn\u2019t allowed to provide subsidies to the residents of states that refused to establish health insurance exchanges under the law.\nOnly 13 states and the District of Columbia have their own exchanges. If this bid to derail the Affordable Care Act succeeds, the subsidies would disappear -- maybe immediately, maybe a little later -- for Obamacare enrollees everywhere else.\nBehind the numbers, however, is a very human story. Without the subsidies, health insurance costs would spike beyond the means of low- and moderate-income recipients. As a result, close to 10 million people would lose their health coverage. Many others would face major increases in the premiums they pay for insurance. \n.hpin-interview { text-align:center; float:left; width:300px; margin-right: 7px; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color:#333; margin-bottom:20px; line-height:15px;} .hpin-interview img { display:block; margin-bottom: 5px;} .feature-dropcap {<br>\nfloat: left; font-size: 72px; line-height: 59px; padding-top: 4px; padding-right: 8px; padding-left: 3px; } .intro { margin-bottom:32px; } .entry .feature { width:75%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto; margin-bottom:20px;} .hpin-state { font-size:11px; }\n", "date": "\n03/03/2015", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/obamacare-subsidies-supreme-court_n_6784688", "tags": "care obamacare hang court health means back states disaster- supreme -- act lives balance subsidies affordable insurance courting"}
