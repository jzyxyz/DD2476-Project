{"title": "Trump Administration Takes Another Step To Roll Back Obamacare", "content": "Republican efforts to roll back the Affordable Care Act\u2019s insurance reforms continued Tuesday,\u00a0when the Trump administration proposed regulations that would make it easier for health insurers to sell cheap, short-term policies that leave out key benefits and are available only to people in good health.\nAnnouncement of the proposal, which has been in the works for several months, came two months after President Donald Trump signed Republican legislation\u00a0eliminating\u00a0the individual mandate, which makes people pay a financial penalty if they don\u2019t have insurance. \nTaken together, the two steps \u2015 getting rid of the mandate and then changing the rules on short-term plans \u2015\u00a0could accelerate an evolution already underway for people buying insurance on their own, rather than through an employer.\nIn many states, premiums have risen substantially in the past few years, as plans have struggled to attract customers in relatively good health. Federal tax credits, which the Affordable Care Act also created, insulate low- and many middle-income people from these increases \u2015 allowing them to get comprehensive coverage, regardless of medical status, at low prices.\nBut people at higher incomes receive no such assistance and, in some cases, the premiums make it difficult or even impossible for them to get traditional insurance. This is particularly true in more rural parts of the country, and especially for older consumers, thanks to a combination of factors \u2015 some related to the design of the ACA, and some related to the way hostile Republican officials at the state and national level have implemented it.\nThe regulation that the administration proposed on Tuesday would make it easier for some of these people to get short-term plans, which are generally cheaper because they do not have to follow all of Obamacare\u2019s rules.\u00a0They do not have to cover mental health and other \u201cessential benefits,\u201d for example, and they can have annual or lifetime limits on the bills they will pay.\nBut short-term plans are generally not available to people with pre-existing conditions and wouldn\u2019t cover the expenses of people with some serious illnesses anyway.\u00a0If short-term plans were to draw off a substantial number of relatively healthy customers, they would drive up the price of traditional, fully regulated insurance plans even more.\nIn the end, the new regulation could allow some people \u2015 especially those who find current coverage unaffordable \u2015 to buy ultra-cheap, relatively skimpy plans.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to offer more affordable coverage options,\u201d Seema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said during a conference call Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s about allowing individuals, not the government, to make decisions about what works for them and their families.\u201d\nBut the new regulations would also render the law\u2019s insurance reforms less effective, making it more difficult for people who need or want more comprehensive coverage to get it.\n\u201cThis is the Trump administration\u2019s end run around Congress,\u201d Sabrina Corlette, research professor at Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Health Insurance Reforms, told HuffPost. \u201cThe end result will be higher premiums and fewer plan choices for people with health care needs, as well as for healthy people who want the kind of benefits and financial protection that real insurance is supposed to provide.\u201d\nA key variable in all of this is the states, which have authority to regulate such plans on their own. Several already have strong rules on the book, as a recent survey of state policies from the Commonwealth Fund noted. More states could take similar action.\nShort-term plans are a vestige of the old health care system, the one that existed before the ACA took effect and made comprehensive coverage more widely available. At least in theory,\u00a0these plans are primarily for people with temporary gaps in coverage \u2015 because they are in between jobs, or perhaps about to have a change in their life circumstance like getting married.\nObamacare allowed insurers to keep selling such plans, but it also gave the federal government authority to regulate them tightly. \nThe Obama administration did just that. When it wrote the rules for the individual mandate, the administration said that short-term plans would not count as qualifying coverage, which meant that people who had these plans would still have to pay the penalty.\u00a0The administration also limited these short-term policies to durations of just three months\u00a0\u2014 although that regulation just took effect this year, and some insurers have found ways to sell a year\u2019s worth of coverage even with that regulation in force.\u00a0(Basically, they allow customers to buy four plans, each for a duration of three months, at one time.)\nThe Obama administration made these decisions because the whole point of the ACA\u2019s private insurance reforms was to transform the market for people buying coverage on their own, so that everybody \u2015 healthy and sick, young and old \u2015 was paying into one pool and was part of the same system. That way,\u00a0insurers would have enough money to cover the bills of people with serious medical conditions. \nBut the Obama administration wasn\u2019t simply out to ensure the newly reformed insurance markets could work.\u00a0Regulations on short-term plans were also meant to protect consumers. \nFrequently, people who bought short-term plans ended up facing crushing medical bills, because agents or insurers hadn\u2019t made limits on these plans clear \u2015 or because insurers had found reasons not to cover bills after the fact. In one case that\u2019s currently the subject of a lawsuit in federal court, a heart attack victim who had a short-term policy is on the hook for $900,000, according to a story on short-term plans by Reed Abelson of The New York Times.\nNow, Republicans are undoing these reforms.\u00a0The regulations that the Trump administration just proposed would rescind the Obama administration\u2019s limit on short-term plans, so that insurers could sell policies that last a full year. Starting in 2019, people buying such plans wouldn\u2019t have to worry about paying the individual mandate penalty, since the GOP\u2019s new\u00a0tax legislation\u00a0reduces that penalty to zero.\nThese steps could help split insurance markets into two \u2015 one with relatively cheap, skimpy short-term plans that would be available to people who are in good health, and one with highly expensive comprehensive insurance that would be available to anybody, regardless of pre-existing conditions.\nPeople who bought the short-term plans would frequently save money, as long as they didn\u2019t get sick and find themselves on the hook for bills the short-term plans don\u2019t cover. But premiums for those comprehensive policies could get even higher than they are now.\nThe majority of people buying coverage on their own are eligible for tax credits that offset premiums, which get bigger as premiums go higher. In general, they won\u2019t have to pay more for coverage, even as it gets more expensive. But people who earn\u00a0too much to qualify for the tax credits \u2015 anybody with income above four times the poverty line, or $98,400 for a family of four \u2015 would bear the full brunt of those higher premiums.\nIt\u2019s a problem that already exists in some states, like Iowa and Tennessee, but it could get worse and affect even more Americans if the Trump administration regulations go into effect, especially if the new measures cause more insurers to abandon markets altogether.\nJust how big a difference this regulation would ultimately make is difficult to say. In a fact sheet accompanying the proposed regulations, HHS said that for 2019 it expects 100,000 to 200,000 people to drop traditional coverage and buy short-term policies instead. That is not a huge number.\nBut over time, the plans could draw even more people, especially if insurers and the independent brokers who sell plans push them aggressively. And some experts think that rough estimate, of just 100,000 to 200,000 people shifting plans initially, is too low.\nThe regulations must go through a formal, 60-day comment period before they become final. During that period, the three departments issuing the regulation \u2015 Health and Human Services, Labor, and Treasury \u2015 are likely to hear from a variety of experts, advocates, and industry groups wary of the changes. \nOne of them is America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, the largest trade organization representing insurers. \u201cWhile we are reviewing the proposed rule to understand its impact on the people we serve, we remain concerned that expanded use of short-term policies could further fragment the individual market, which would lead to higher premiums for many consumers, particularly those with pre-existing conditions,\u201d\u00a0Kristine Grow, group\u2019s senior vice president for communications, said on Tuesday.\u00a0\nBut not all insurers will be unhappy if these new regulations are finalized. UnitedHealth, which dropped out\u00a0of AHIP a few years ago, already sells such policies. In an earnings call in October,\u00a0the company\u2019s chief executive said the opportunity to sell more of them \u2015 along with so-called \u201cassociation health plans,\u201d which allow small businesses to buy policies that are also exempt from some of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s regulations \u2015 would be a profit opportunity.\nThe proposed regulation also seeks comment on the question of whether, somehow, these short-term plans should be \u201crenewable\u201d \u2015 that is, whether insurers should allow people to stay on the same plans, year after year. Of course, doing so would seem to mean they aren\u2019t really short-term plans at all, but rather an alternative form of long-term insurance that simply isn\u2019t subject to regulations protecting people with pre-existing conditions. In theory, that is not legal under the Affordable Care Act.\nIf and when the regulation becomes final, as seems likely, attention will shift quickly to state officials, who can regulate insurance plans on their own. States could decide to keep the three-month limit in place, for example. Or they could go as far as New Jersey did, and prohibit short-term plans altogether.\nThey could also decide, separately, to introduce their own form of the individual mandate, as officials in at least some states are already talking about doing.\nThis article has been updated to include comment from an America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans representative.", "date": "\n02/20/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-obamacare-insurance-rules_n_5a3d3cb5e4b06d1621b42a1b", "tags": "administration coverage obamacare insurers short-term step back takes trump roll \u2015 another could plans insurance health"}
