{"title": "These Candidates Could Be America\u2019s First Muslim Women In Congress", "content": "A handful of candidates running for office in 2018 could soon become the first Muslim woman (or women) to ever serve in U.S. Congress.\nDemocrats Fayrouz Saad and Rashida Tlaib are running for House seats in Michigan; Ilhan Omar for a House seat in Minnesota; Deedra Abboud for Senate in Arizona; and Tahirah Amatul-Wadud for a House seat in Massachusetts.\u00a0If any of them get past their primaries and win in November, they would break historic barriers for Muslim women\u2019s representation.\nTheir candidacies come at a particularly trying time for Muslim Americans.\u00a0Over the past couple years, the Muslim community in the United States has faced a spike in hate crimes\u00a0amid President Donald Trump\u2019s election, Islamophobic rhetoric and policies from the White House, and a travel ban upheld by the Supreme Court targeting Muslim-majority countries.\nThe women are part of a record wave of Muslim candidates running for office in 2018, alongside\u00a0unprecedented numbers of women running since Trump\u2019s election and a movement of progressive candidates seeking to push the Democratic Party establishment further left. Several of the candidates were endorsed by the Justice Democrats \u2015 the progressive political group that backed\u00a0Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0in New York in her now-famous upset win.\nIf victorious, they would follow in the footsteps of Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), the first Muslim ever elected to Congress, and Rep. Andr\u00e9 Carson (D-Ind.), the second and only other. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not why I\u2019m running, to be the first anything,\u201d Saad told HuffPost of the possibility of being the nation\u2019s first Muslim congresswoman, echoing other candidates HuffPost spoke to. \u201cIt\u2019s really about the issues.\u201d\nBut the candidates also acknowledged the significance of what their win would mean for representation, with Tlaib and Saad both celebrating the possibility of finally having a \u201cseat at the table.\u201d \u00a0\n\u201cWhat was missing was having a voice at the table, to change the face of leadership,\u201d Saad said. \u201cIt\u2019s the ability to break down some stereotypes and misconceptions just by being there.\u201d \nMeet five Muslim women candidates vying for national office.\nFormer Michigan state legislator Rashida Tlaib is running in the state\u2019s 13th Congressional District, one of a\u00a0half-dozen Democratic candidates seeking to fill the seat of Rep. John Conyers, who resigned in December amid allegations of sexual harassment.\nIf she wins, Tlaib would become \u2015 in addition to being the first Muslim woman in Congress \u2015 the first Palestinian-American woman in the body.\n\u201cPeople think it\u2019s corny \u2015 I do want to change the world, and I want people like me to have a seat at the table,\u201d Tlaib told HuffPost by phone in early July. \u00a0\nThe Detroit-born mother of two and daughter of Palestinian immigrants already made history\u00a0in 2008 by becoming the first Muslim woman to serve in the Michigan Legislature.\nIn Michigan \u2015 a state with a significant Muslim and Arab-American community \u2015 Democrat Abdul El-Sayed will also be on the ballot in the Aug. 7 primary, in his case hoping to become the nation\u2019s first Muslim governor.\n\u201cPeople are ready for someone like me,\u201d\u00a0Tlaib said. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about being Muslim, Palestinian, brown or a woman \u2015 I vote the right way and go beyond that.\u201d\nTlaib, who grew up the eldest of 14 children, is running on a progressive platform, including supporting Medicare for All and a $15 minimum wage. She told HuffPost she\u2019s \u201cgoing to abolish ICE\u201d \u2015 a leftist stance that has recently gained traction among a few\u00a0leading Democrats (including\u00a0lawmakers expected to run in 2020) since Ocasio-Cortez ran on that idea and won. Tlaib has received Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s backing, and like the New York candidate, doesn\u2019t accept money from corporate PACs.\nAs of the end of last month, Tlaib was leading her Democratic opponents in fundraising. In a district that has historically voted Democratic,\u00a0the winner of the Aug. 7 primary would likely be elected in November\u2019s general election. \nMinnesota state Rep. Ilhan Omar is running for a House seat in her state\u2019s 5th Congressional District, to fill the spot left open after Rep. Keith Ellison announced his bid to become the state\u2019s attorney general. \nOmar was born in Somalia and spent four years in a refugee camp in Kenya before coming to the U.S. at age 12. She already broke barriers in 2016\u00a0when she became the country\u2019s first Somali-American legislator.\n\u201cI hope my candidacy would allow people to have the boldness to encourage people who don\u2019t fit into [a] particular demographic to seek office,\u201d she told HuffPost that year. \u201cTo believe in the good will of the people to select someone they believe shares their vision and not necessarily their identity.\u201d \u00a0\nThe mother of three, who has lived in Minnesota for two decades, is running for Congress on a staunchly progressive platform, including a $15 minimum wage, Medicare for All and abolishing ICE.\nIn her crowded primary set for Aug. 14, Omar has garnered the Minnesota Democrats\u2019 endorsement. In the solidly Democratic district,\u00a0the winner of the party\u2019s nomination would likely be elected in November.\u00a0\nFormer Obama administration official Fayrouz Saad is running for Michigan\u2019s 11th Congressional District in a crowded race to fill the seat of outgoing GOP Rep. Dave Trott.\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty simple for me: I\u2019m the daughter of immigrants. My parents came here over 40 years ago in search of the American Dream,\u201d the Michigan-native and Harvard Kennedy School graduate told HuffPost in mid-July, noting her family owns a small, meat wholesale business in Detroit. \u201cI\u2019m a product of that American Dream.\u201d \n\u201cI understand the American Dream can be fragile, and not everyone always has access to it,\u201d the 35-year-old added. \u201cI want to help protect that for folks.\u201d\nFollowing her career in public service, first during the Obama administration in the Department of Homeland Security working on terrorism, then as director of Detroit\u2019s office of immigrant affairs, Saad decided to run for public office after Trump\u2019s election, pushed by what she saw as the American Dream \u201cbeing threatened\u201d by Trump and \u201cthe Republican Congress that continues to enable him.\u201d\nEndorsed by Justice Democrats, Saad\u2019s campaign does not take corporate PAC money and pushes a progressive platform including Medicare for All and $15 minimum wage. \n\u201cI\u2019m an Arab-American, Muslim woman who\u2019s worked on national security in this country,\u201d Saad said,\u00a0noting what sets her apart from her Democratic opponents. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about what the actual threats to national security are \u2015 because it\u2019s not refugees and immigrants.\u201d\nTo have a shot at winning\u00a0in November, Saad first has to beat four other Democratic candidates in Michigan\u2019s Aug. 7 primary. Analysts say the general election could be a toss-up\u00a0in a district that voted Obama in 2008 and Republican in the subsequent presidential elections.\nCivil rights attorney Tahirah Amatul-Wadud is running for a House seat in Massachusetts\u2019 1st Congressional District. She faces an uphill battle\u00a0in her Sept. 4 primary against incumbent Democratic Rep. Richard Neal, who has been in Congress for three decades.\nThe mother of seven and first-time candidate is running on a progressive platform, including Medicare for all, universal internet access and ending the school-to-prison pipeline.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always navigated in spaces where I\u2019m the only person like me, and a lot of the spaces I\u2019m in are predominantly white,\u201d the black, Muslim candidate based in western Massachusetts told HuffPost in April. \u201cThere\u2019s a universality to my story, and my message and my platform that allows people to appreciate me beyond my race.\u201d\nIn the safely Democratic district, with no Republican challengers, whoever wins the September Democratic primary would be securing the seat in Congress.\n\u201cMy being in the race is already a victory for our entire community,\u201d Amatul-Wadud said. \u201cRegardless of who identifies themselves with me \u2026 we\u2019re already winning because we\u2019re amplifying the needs of so many people throughout the district and throughout the country.\u201d\nFirst-time political candidate\u00a0Deedra Abboud is running for U.S. Senate as a Democrat in Arizona, seeking to fill the seat of retiring Republican Sen. Jeff Flake.\n\u201cIn 2016, I became really concerned about marginalized communities I\u2019d worked with getting thrown under the bus for political gain,\u201d the former immigration attorney and community activist told HuffPost in early July. \u201cI decided to do something about it.\u201d\nAbboud, 46, who has lived in Phoenix for two decades, is running on a progressive platform and is not accepting corporate PAC money. After converting to Islam in her 20s, she founded the Arizona chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in 2001 after 9/11. Last year, her campaign faced a swarm of anti-Muslim bigotry online and at events \u2015 though such harassment has let up dramatically this year, she noted. \nWhen asked what it would mean for her to potentially become the first Muslim woman in Congress, she said it would be \u201cvery significant,\u201d noting that she\u2019d also be Arizona\u2019s first Muslim Senator, and its first representative to wear a headscarf.\n\u201cEven me running raises the idea that a Muslim woman could do this,\u201d Abboud said. \u201cThat\u2019s good for everybody ... for younger generations to be able to look at a strong Muslim woman, standing up to bullies, and not allowing anybody else to decide what her identity should be.\u201d \nAnalysts say Abboud is a longshot to win. In her Aug. 28 primary, she\u2019s up against centrist Democrat Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, who is heavily\u00a0favored. The victor will face the GOP nominee in November \u2015 either Rep. Martha McSally, former state Sen. Kelli Ward or former Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who was convicted of illegally targeting Latinos and whom Trump later pardoned. \nWhile Democrats haven\u2019t won a U.S. Senate seat in Arizona since 1988, CNN ranked this race among the top 10 seats that could flip in the midterms.\nAbboud, who previously contributed to HuffPost\u2019s open blogging platform, wrote last October that she knew people would look at her as \u201cThe Muslim Candidate\u201d if she entered politics. \u201cI am not the Muslim candidate,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI am an American candidate, a Democratic candidate, a grassroots candidate and, yes, I happen to be Muslim.\u201d\nThis article has been updated to include Tahirah Amatul-Wadud\u2019s candidacy.", "date": "\n07/25/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/first-muslim-women-congress-candidates_n_5b57675ee4b0b15aba92ebf2", "tags": "candidates america first \u201d \u2015 muslim running democratic could women congress seat"}
