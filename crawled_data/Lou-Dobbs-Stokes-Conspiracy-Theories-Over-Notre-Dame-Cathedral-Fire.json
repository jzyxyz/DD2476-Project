{"title": "Lou Dobbs Stokes Conspiracy Theories Over Notre Dame Cathedral Fire", "content": "Fox Business host Lou Dobbs on Tuesday night appeared to stoke conspiracy theories as he suggested French authorities took a \u201cpolitical decision\u201d to quickly rule out arson as a cause of the devastating fire at the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris.\nFrench officials are still investigating what started Monday\u2019s blaze at the iconic 850-year-old building, which they believe began as an accident\u00a0and was \u201cpotentially linked\u201d to renovation work.\nBut Dobbs muddied the waters for his viewers when he claimed it sounded \u201clike a different kind of decision, perhaps a political decision rather than one based on careful investigation of the facts.\u201d\nCheck out the clip here:\nDobbs earlier referenced an article by the International Business Times on a recent spate of vandalism in French churches in a bid to prove his point that the early dismissal of arson was a political one.\nHe said:\nDobbs\u2019 approach was in stark contrast to that taken by Fox News hosts Shepard Smith and Neil Cavuto, who both cut interviews short on Monday when guests repeated speculation that the fire was deliberately started.\nOther baseless and dangerous rumors to emerge about the cause of the blaze have blamed Muslims and French President Emmanuel Macron.", "date": "\n04/17/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/fox-business-lou-dobbs-notre-dame-speculation_n_5cb6d4e6e4b082aab08e3c01", "tags": "dobbs arson fire fox cause stokes business notre theories political decision lou cathedral dame french conspiracy"}
