A forum on the effort in Beijing, hosted on Sunday by China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, drew President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and other state leaders, as well as officials from more than three dozen countries, including the United States.\nIf enacted as planned, the initiative could lead to a global building spree; China has promised more than $1 trillion of investment over the long term.\nWestern companies are angling aggressively for a piece of the action. Citibank won a contract from Bank of China to handle a complex $3 billion bond offering last month to raise money for opening branches across Asia, Eastern Europe and East Africa. The technology and manufacturing company Honeywell International is selling equipment to Central Asia for processing natural gas.\nSome non-Chinese companies are also tweaking their businesses to win more orders related to Beijing\u2019s plan, and G.E. has rearranged its marketing staff for global power equipment to give them priority.\nChina\u2019s spending doesn\u2019t necessarily mean immediate profit. Most of the money has yet to be earmarked, much less spent. And China \u2014 which has too many factories making too much steel and cement \u2014 is making sure that its own companies will be the biggest beneficiaries.\nCompanies like Caterpillar, for example, will have to contend with a fast-growing, government-controlled Chinese maker of construction machinery, the Xuzhou Construction Machinery Group, known as X.C.M.G. Such businesses, facing a maturing market at home, are eager to find new markets \u2014 a core ambition of the plan.\nAt one of X.C.M.G.\u2019s cavernous factories here in north-central China, workers are rushing to double the number of excavators that can be made each year, mainly by adding robots to the assembly process. The initiative has the factory humming 16 hours a day, six days a week.\n\u201c\u2018One Belt, One Road\u2019 makes our internationalization strategy like a tiger with wings added,\u201d said Wang Min, X.C.M.G.\u2019s chairman.\nFor businesses, the plan offers uncertainty as well as promise. The infrastructure that China is building could someday become the avenues for billions of dollars in increased trade \u2014 or become debt-ridden sinkholes. Mr. Xi is pressuring companies already doing business in China to participate no matter what the prospects.\nThe hope of future prosperity is enticing. Li and Fung, a Hong Kong company that for decades has sent Chinese-made goods to American and European department stores, is now marketing to small and medium-size retailers in the developing world. It is a bet that the Chinese initiative will lift consumer spending across dozens of countries, said Victor Fung, chairman of the Fung Group, its parent company.\nOthers are waiting to see whether China\u2019s ambitious idea translates into actual investment \u2014 and whether American and European companies will have a place at the table. They are particularly troubled that the program seems to be mostly about Chinese exports, and not much about imports.\n\u201cTell us what we are going to get out of this,\u201d said James Zimmerman, a lawyer in Beijing who is a former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, referring to the West. \u201cIt\u2019s a nonstarter if it\u2019s all about bringing Chinese goods to Europe, or if it\u2019s all one way.\u201d\nA top official in the Trump administration, Matthew Pottinger, the senior director for Asia at the National Security Council, said at Sunday\u2019s conference that China should provide transparency in the bidding for contracts related to the initiative, to give a better chance to companies that aren\u2019t state-owned.\nChina\u2019s industrial overcapacity is a big motivator behind the plan. China can make nearly 1.1 billion tons of steel a year, as much as the rest of the world put together, but has domestic demand for only about 800 million tons. The initiative might absorb only about 30 million tons a year, according to a recent study by the European Union Chamber of Commerce.\nSome American companies are taking steps to improve their chances \u2014 but that sometimes means manufacturing more in China, not the United States. Ms. Duan said G.E. had focused on ways to produce goods in China to meet the country\u2019s requirements that some of the work be done locally. Honeywell said in a statement that it had also been looking for ways to produce more goods in China for the program.\n\u201cWhen the roads are built, when the ports are built, when the power plants are built, I think the other opportunities will come,\u201d Ms. Duan said.\nOthers are waiting and watching. Investments have been heavily concentrated in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and other nearby countries that are geopolitical priorities for China but that have weak economies.\nVincent Lo, a real estate billionaire who is the chairman of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, led a team of 50 Shanghai and Hong Kong businesspeople to Thailand and Vietnam last week to explore investments based on the Chinese initiative, he said. Trips to the Mideast and Eastern Europe may be next. Central Asia is far down his list.\n\u201cIf Central Asian countries are keen, we will work with them, but of course we\u2019ll have to look at the financial fundamentals,\u201d Mr. Lo said. \u201cA lot of these countries will have to do a lot of reforms to be able to receive capital.\u201d\nChinese players look to be big winners from the outset.\nMr. Xi has designated the city of Xuzhou \u2014 a dusty rail hub roughly halfway along the five-hour bullet train trip between Beijing and Shanghai \u2014 as a key manufacturing base for his policy. At the foot of a hill here topped by a new complex of Buddhist temples, Caterpillar has one of the world\u2019s biggest construction machinery factories, making huge pieces of digging equipment.\nNearby, its local rival X.C.M.G. is ramping up. Employing 23,000 workers in this city and controlled by the Xuzhou municipal government, X.C.M.G. is China\u2019s largest manufacturer of construction machinery, from excavators to cranes to bulldozers.\nThe factory makes tank-size excavators in a series of four halls with 80-foot-high steel roofs. Almost everything inside is new, from the 13 steel-cutting robots the size of cottages to the costly Italian and Japanese machining equipment that precisely trim steel components.\nMr. Wang, X.C.M.G.\u2019s chairman, dismissed concerns that the business won\u2019t materialize.\n\u201cWe should be persistent and manage our business as well,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the spring comes, we will arise abruptly.\u201d", "date": "May 14, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/14/business/china-one-belt-one-road-us-companies.html", "tags": "\u2018 belt want china u.s. road companies initiative \u201d global one chinese \u2014 firms equipment spending"}
