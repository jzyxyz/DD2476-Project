{"title": "In Race for Global Power, U.S. and China Push Nations to Pick a Side", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The escalating brinkmanship between the United States and China as they race to quash each other\u2019s global influence is forcing other nations to pick sides between the two superpowers, putting at risk future cooperation on geopolitical threats and a resolution to the economic standoff.\nThe  rivalry, which has reached a new pitch and scope, is now centered on the trade war that President Trump started this year. But tensions have also sharpened over a broad range of diplomatic and military issues, like Taiwan, the South China Sea and economic sanctions on North Korea and Iran.\nAcross the globe, the United States and China are jockeying to build alliances or partnerships and shut out the other power. The hard-nosed competition surfaced over the weekend at an Asian economic forum that pitted Vice President Mike Pence against President Xi Jinping of China. The dispute threatens to disrupt the Group of 20 summit meeting that starts Nov. 30 in Argentina.\nThe United States again vented its frustration on Tuesday, accusing China of continuing to engage in unfair trade practices despite Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs. \u201cChina fundamentally has not altered its acts, policies and practices related to technology transfer, intellectual property and innovation, and indeed appears to have taken further unreasonable actions in recent months,\u201d the Office of the United States Trade Representative said in a report.\nMr. Trump has repeatedly said China \u201cwants to make a deal very badly,\u201d but continues to warn that he will tax nearly all Chinese imports if Beijing does not open its markets to American companies and end its unfair practices.\n\u201cChina has been ripping off our country for many, many years,\u201d the president told reporters at the White House on Tuesday. \u201cAnd they don\u2019t rip us off with me.\u201d\nIn Beijing on Wednesday, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Geng Shuang, responded to such criticisms by pointing to a paper previously issued by the government that rebutted similar accusations. \u201cIt is quite normal to have economic and trade frictions,\u201d he said at a news conference. \u201cThe key is to resolve them through dialogue and consultation on the basis of mutual respect, equality and good faith.\u201d\nAt the economic forum in Papua New Guinea over the weekend, the United States and China openly clashed over trade in  their most explosive diplomatic standoff of the Trump administration. Mr. Pence and Mr. Xi each led delegations that sought to corral the other nations in attendance to side with his country.\nElsewhere, the two nations are forging bilateral and multilateral trade pacts in parallel that limit options for the other. During his visit to the Philippines this week, Mr. Xi signed 29 trade and investment deals, though many were broad and vague.\nSome countries are bristling at the economic demands that the two superpowers have made.\nCanada\u2019s agriculture minister said Monday that his country could freely enter into formal trade negotiations with China, despite an apparent attempt by the United States to exercise leverage over any such action.\nOn Tuesday, in a blow to China, the European Union announced a proposed law to coordinate scrutiny of foreign investment in strategic sectors, such as ports and technology.\nMr. Trump and Mr. Xi are both expected to attend the Group of 20 meeting. While they could come to some mutual understanding, \u201cit is becoming increasingly difficult for both sides to reconcile their competing perspectives,\u201d said Ryan Hass, a China analyst at the Brookings Institution.\n\u201cBoth countries are becoming entrenched in their narratives and having increasing difficulty finding common ground,\u201d Mr. Hass said. But virtually no country in Asia wants to be exclusively aligned with either power, he added.\nOn the issue of recognition of Taiwan, China and the United States are pushing nations and private companies. Since 2016, China has campaigned, often with promises of loans and investments, to persuade a small number of nations to sever diplomatic ties with Taiwan. Three Central American countries did so over the last two years, infuriating top American officials, even though the United States cut formal ties with Taiwan in favor of Communist-ruled China in 1979.\nAmerican officials are trying to deter nations from taking Chinese loans, often for infrastructure projects, by talking about Beijing\u2019s \u201cdebt-trap diplomacy.\u201d In their global propaganda push, they promise that American private investment will flow throughout the world, in part because of a new program to aid businesses with up to $60 billion in loans and loan insurance.\nOfficials in Washington are also trying to rally Southeast Asian nations to stand firm against Beijing over its expansive territorial claims and military buildup in the disputed South China Sea. Mr. Pence criticized China\u2019s moves as \u201cempire and aggression\u201d in a speech at an annual regional forum last week in Singapore.\nChina, for its part, has signaled to other nations that they should push back against Mr. Trump on one of his signature foreign policy actions \u2014 withdrawing the United States from the nuclear agreement with Iran.\nThe Obama administration forged the deal to limit Iran\u2019s nuclear program in 2015 with other world powers, including China; backing out of it was one of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign promises. A top Chinese foreign policy official said in Washington this month that the agreement should \u201cbe implemented and observed.\u201d China is continuing to buy oil from Iran, as are some other nations.\nChina\u2019s moves to strengthen its global standing have received a big boost from Mr. Trump\u2019s denunciations of multilateral institutions, alliances and treaties.\nMr. Trump pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which shook the confidence of Asian nations. After Mr. Trump announced in June 2017 that the United States would leave the Paris climate accord, China has presented itself as the new standard-bearer on addressing climate change. Earlier that year, in a speech in Davos, Switzerland, Mr. Xi said China would defend the globalized economy in the face of criticism by Mr. Trump.\nSome Trump administration officials are optimistic that the two leaders will emerge from the Group of 20 meeting with the framework of a trade agreement that would reduce America\u2019s bilateral trade deficit with China and protect the intellectual property of American companies who do business there. Treasury Department officials have been in frequent contact with their Chinese counterparts in hopes of building the groundwork for a deal.\nHowever, the latest lurch toward a d\u00e9tente has renewed division among Mr. Trump\u2019s economic team.\nThis month, Peter Navarro, Mr. Trump\u2019s top trade adviser, warned that a weak agreement would have the \u201cstench\u201d of Wall Street. In a public rebuke days later, Larry Kudlow, the National Economic Council director, called Mr. Navarro \u201cway off base.\u201d Mr. Navarro\u2019s comments also frustrated Mr. Trump who, according to a person familiar with his thinking, felt boxed in by the remarks.\nThe dissonance has left China uncertain of the Trump administration\u2019s goals and cast a shadow of uncertainty over their negotiations.\n\u201cIt feels to me like the administration doesn\u2019t quite have one strategy toward China,\u201d said Jon B. Alterman, a global security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cNot only do you see administration leaders saying different things, but it feels like they\u2019re not integrated, especially in the absence of something like the TPP, which was a genuine long-term strategy to deal with China\u2019s rise.\u201d\nOn Monday, the Commerce Department began drawing up new regulations on export controls, outlining potential industries to protect \u2014 such as artificial intelligence and quantum robotics \u2014 from Chinese theft of intellectual property. In early November, the Justice Department charged a Chinese state-owned company with stealing trade secrets from an American technology company. And last month, the Trump administration outlined a more aggressive system for policing foreign investment, using the expanded powers of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.\nThe Trump administration has also embarked on bilateral trade deals with other countries with the intention of exerting pressure on China. Despite abandoning the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the administration is forging ahead with negotiations with Japan and the Philippines, and officials are eyeing possible talks with Vietnam and India.\nCriticism of China\u2019s trade practices was at the center of the blowup at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum over the weekend.\nIn several meetings, Wang Yi, the Chinese foreign minister, and his colleagues objected to a draft of the forum\u2019s closing statement that asserted, \u201cWe agree to fight protectionism including all unfair trade practices.\u201d\nRaising his voice, Mr. Wang accused American officials of trying to insert a veiled reference to China, said one American official who was there. At one point, Chinese officials barged into the office of the foreign minister of Papua New Guinea to demand changes.\nOnly China objected to the draft. The forum closed without a consensus statement from the 21 member economies for the first time since 1989.\n\u201cIt was truly a stupid move by the Chinese,\u201d said Bonnie S. Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cI guess we should all conclude that China will do whatever it takes to continue to pursue unfair trade practices.\u201d\n\u201cAnd they will also continue to put their narrow self-interests first at the expense of multilateral institutions,\u201d she added. \u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d", "date": "Nov. 21, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/21/us/politics/usa-china-trade-war.html", "tags": "\u201c china u.s. united states side global nations trump trade race power pick push"}
