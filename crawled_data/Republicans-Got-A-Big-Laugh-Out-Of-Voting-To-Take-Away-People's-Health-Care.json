{"title": "Republicans Got A Big Laugh Out Of Voting To Take Away People's Health Care", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 As millions came to grips with the fact they could soon be left without health insurance, President Donald Trump and House Republicans gathered in the Rose Garden of the White House to celebrate what they view as a victory for the American people.\nOn Thursday afternoon, the Republican-led House narrowly passed a bill to repeal and replace significant parts of the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare,\u00a0a 2010 law that expanded coverage to about 20 million people.\nAnd, as the pictures show, it was all fun and games for GOP leaders.\nThat deliberate spectacle \u2014 Republican lawmakers chuckling at the prospect of passing into law a measure that would uninsure millions and weaken protections for those with pre-existing conditions \u2014 did not go unnoticed.\u00a0\nAnd in the end, it could come back to bite them, as campaign cash has already begun to roll in\u00a0for their Democratic opponents.\u00a0\nBefore Thursday\u2019s vote,\u00a0House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) warned House Republicans that if they supported the measure they will \u201chave this vote tattooed on them.\u201d And after the vote, Democrats taunted their GOP colleagues by singing, \u201cNa-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, hey, hey, hey! Goodbye!\u201d\nRep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer he expects Thursday will be the \u201cone and only celebration\u201d you\u2019ll see from Republicans on this bill.\n\u201cVery shortly, I imagine, that [Congressional Budget Office] analysis is going to come out, and it\u2019s going to likely show tens of millions of Americans lose their health care under this plan,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cAnd the image of those Republican members celebrating that loss of coverage for millions may very well come back to haunt them.\u201d\nThursday\u2019s public celebration was reminiscent of January 2016, when congressional Republicans passed an Obamacare repeal bill\u00a0\u2014 legislation that President Barack Obama, obviously,\u00a0vetoed two days later.\u00a0", "date": "\n05/04/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/republicans-laugh-health-care-us_n_590ba129e4b0e7021e9620db", "tags": "people thursday millions voting away laugh take come health \u201d got house bill republicans vote \u2014 care big"}
