{"title": "Fraying Ties With Trump Put Jim Mattis\u2019s Fate in Doubt", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Back when their relationship was fresh and new, and President Trump still called his defense secretary \u201cMad Dog\u201d \u2014 a nickname Jim Mattis detests \u2014 the wiry retired Marine general often took a dinner break to eat burgers with his boss in the White House residence.\nMr. Mattis brought briefing folders with him, aides said, to help explain the military\u2019s shared \u201cready to fight tonight\u201d strategy with South Korea, and why the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has long been viewed as central to protecting the United States. Using his folksy manner, Mr. Mattis talked the president out of ordering torture against terrorism detainees and persuaded him to send thousands more American troops to Afghanistan \u2014 all without igniting the public Twitter castigations that have plagued other national security officials.\nBut the burger dinners have stopped. Interviews with more than a dozen White House, congressional and current and former Defense Department officials over the past six weeks paint a portrait of a president who has soured on his defense secretary, weary of unfavorable comparisons to Mr. Mattis as the adult in the room, and increasingly concerned that he is a Democrat at heart.\nNearly all of the officials, as well as confidants of Mr. Mattis, spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the internal tensions \u2014 in some cases, out of fear of losing their jobs.\nIn the second year of his presidency, Mr. Trump has largely tuned out his national security aides as he feels more confident as commander in chief, the officials said. Facing what is likely to be a heated re-election fight once the 2018 midterms are over, aides said Mr. Trump was pondering whether he wanted someone running the Pentagon who would be more vocally supportive than Mr. Mattis, who is vehemently protective of the American military against perceptions it could be used for political purposes.\nWhite House officials said Mr. Mattis had balked at a number of Mr. Trump\u2019s requests. That included initially slow-walking the president\u2019s order to ban transgender troops  from the military and refusing a White House demand to stop family members from accompanying troops deploying to South Korea. The Pentagon worried that doing so could have been seen by North Korea as a precursor to war.\nOver the last four months alone, the president and the defense chief have found themselves at odds over NATO policy, whether to resume large-scale military exercises with South Korea and, privately, whether Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw the United States from the Iran nuclear deal has proved effective.\nThe arrival at the White House earlier this year of Mira Ricardel, a deputy national security adviser with a history of bad blood with Mr. Mattis, has coincided with new assertions from the West Wing that the defense secretary may be asked to leave after the midterms.\nMr. Mattis himself is becoming weary, some aides said, of the amount of time spent pushing back against what Defense Department officials think are capricious whims of an erratic president.\nThe defense secretary has been careful to not criticize Mr. Trump outright. Pentagon officials said Mr. Mattis had bent over backward to appear loyal, only to be contradicted by positions the president later staked out. How much longer Mr. Mattis can continue to play the loyal Marine has become an open question in the Pentagon\u2019s E Ring, home to the Defense Department\u2019s top officials.\nThe fate of Mr. Mattis is important because he is widely viewed \u2014 by foreign allies and adversaries but also by the traditional national security establishment in the United States \u2014 as the cabinet official standing between a mercurial president and global tumult.\n\u201cSecretary Mattis is probably one of the most qualified individuals to hold that job,\u201d Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in an interview. His departure from the Pentagon, Mr. Reed said, \u201cwould, first of all, create a disruption in an area where there has been competence and continuity.\u201d\nBut that very sentiment is part of a narrative the president has come to resent.\nThe one-two punch last week of the Bob Woodward book that quoted Mr. Mattis likening Mr. Trump\u2019s intellect to that of a \u201cfifth or sixth grader,\u201d combined with the New York Times Op-Ed by  an unnamed senior administration official who criticized the president, has fueled Mr. Trump\u2019s belief that he wants only like-minded loyalists around him. (Mr. Mattis has denied comparing his boss to an elementary school student and said he did not write the Op-Ed.)\nMr. Trump, two aides said, wants Mr. Mattis to be more like Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, a political supporter of the president. During a televised June 21 cabinet meeting, held as migrant children were being separated from their parents at the southwestern border, Mr. Mattis and Mr. Pompeo were a study of contrasts: On the president\u2019s left, the defense secretary sat stone-faced; on his right, the secretary of state was chuckling at all of Mr. Trump\u2019s jokes.\nGetting Mr. Mattis to abandon the apolitical stand he has clung to his entire life will be next to impossible, his friends and aides said.\nMr. Mattis has assiduously avoided the limelight during his tenure because he is fearful, aides said, about being put on the spot by questions that will expose differences with his boss. He has batted down multiple requests from the White House to go on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d to praise the president\u2019s agenda. And he has appeared before reporters at the podium in the Pentagon press room only a handful of times, giving remarkably few on-the-record one-on-one news media interviews \u2014 one of which was with a reporter for a high school newspaper in Washington State who had obtained Mr. Mattis\u2019s cellphone number.\n\u201cSecretary Mattis lives by a code that is part of his DNA,\u201d said Capt. Jeff Davis, who retired last month from the Navy after serving as a spokesman for Mr. Mattis since early in the Trump administration. \u201cHe is genetically incapable of lying, and genetically incapable of disloyalty.\u201d\nThat means the defense secretary\u2019s only recourse is to stay silent, aides to Mr. Mattis said. While he does not want to publicly disagree with his boss, he is also uncomfortable with showering false praise on Mr. Trump.\nBut cracks are showing.\nIn April, John R. Bolton became the White House national security adviser, replacing Army Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, who was long viewed as a subordinate to Mr. Mattis because of his rank as a three-star general compared with the retired Marine general\u2019s four stars. Mr. Bolton is far more hawkish than either Mr. Mattis or General McMaster; administration officials said his deputy, Ms. Ricardel, actively dislikes the Pentagon chief \u2014 a feeling Mr. Mattis is believed to return in full.\nMs. Ricardel, a former Boeing executive who worked at the Pentagon during the George W. Bush administration, has a reputation for being as combative as Mr. Bolton.\nAs the Trump transition official responsible for Pentagon appointments, Ms. Ricardel stopped Mr. Mattis from hiring Anne Patterson as under secretary of defense for policy, one of the department\u2019s highest political jobs. Ms. Patterson was a career diplomat who served as an ambassador under Presidents Bush, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, but administration officials said Ms. Ricardel suspected Mr. Mattis was trying to load up the Pentagon with Democrats and former supporters of Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign.\n(Mr. Mattis also tried, unsuccessfully, to hire Mich\u00e8le A. Flournoy, a Defense Department under secretary in the Obama administration, as his deputy. \u201cHe needed a deputy who wouldn\u2019t be struggling every other day about whether they could be part of some of the policies that were likely to take shape,\u201d Ms. Flournoy told a conference hosted by Politico.)\nAfter a stint at the Commerce Department, Ms. Ricardel moved to the White House as Mr. Bolton\u2019s deputy. Since her arrival, friction has increased between the White House and the Pentagon \u2014 along with speculation from West Wing aides that Mr. Mattis\u2019s star is falling.\nFor instance, Mr. Mattis has recently resisted White House attempts to closely supervise military operations by demanding details about American troops involved in specific raids in Afghanistan and elsewhere.\nOne American official said the White House had bypassed the Pentagon by getting classified briefings of coming operations directly from the Special Operations task forces, to the frustration of Mr. Mattis.\nThat may seem a small and insular example of bureaucratic gamesmanship. But administration officials said it illustrates the tensions between Mr. Mattis and Mr. Trump: Either the defense secretary cannot appeal to the president, or he has and Mr. Trump is refusing to back him up.\nAsked about disagreements between the National Security Council and the Pentagon, Garrett Marquis, a council spokesman, said in an email that \u201cAmbassador Bolton is coordinating and working closely with all national security agencies to provide the president with national security options and guidance.\u201d\nIn contrast with General McMaster, Mr. Bolton recently began attending regular weekly meetings between Mr. Mattis and Mr. Pompeo. Pentagon officials complain that White House interference has returned to the level of Susan E. Rice, who as Mr. Obama\u2019s national security adviser was accused of micromanaging the department\u2019s every move.\nMr. Mattis has repeatedly been blindsided by his boss this summer.\nIn June, Mr. Trump ordered Mr. Mattis to set up a Space Force over the defense secretary\u2019s objections that such a move would weigh down an already cumbersome bureaucracy.\nIn July, the president blew up a NATO summit meeting that Mr. Mattis and other national security officials had worked on for months. The Pentagon chief and others saved the final agreement only because they shielded it from the president and urged envoys to complete it before Mr. Trump arrived in Brussels.\nIn August, the president undercut Mr. Mattis after a news conference at the Pentagon in which the defense secretary suggested that the United States military would resume war games on the Korean Peninsula. The exercises had been suspended \u2014 against Mr. Mattis\u2019s advice \u2014 after Mr. Trump met with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, in Singapore. \u201cThere is no reason at this time to be spending large amounts of money on joint U.S.-South Korea war games,\u201d the president tweeted.\nMeanwhile, Mr. Mattis has begun questioning the efficacy of Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal \u2014 a move that, again, was made against his advice. Mr. Mattis has told aides that he has yet to see any difference in Iran\u2019s behavior since Mr. Trump withdrew the United States from the agreement between world powers and Tehran.\nMr. Mattis famously was pushed out of his job as head of United States Central Command in 2013 because he was viewed as too much of a hawk on Iran policy during the Obama administration. But now, in the Trump administration, Mr. Mattis makes his arguments on Iran from the left of Mr. Bolton, Ms. Ricardel and the president himself.\nFor Mr. Trump, getting rid of his popular defense secretary would carry a political cost. Mr. Mattis is revered by the men and women of the American military. Most of the rest of his fans are people Mr. Trump does not care about: Democrats, establishment Republicans and American allies.\nBut moderate Republicans \u2014 whom Mr. Trump will need in 2020 \u2014 appear to trust Mr. Mattis as well, and firing him could hurt the president with that key group.\nMr. Trump, at the moment, is publicly standing by his defense secretary. \u201cHe\u2019ll stay right there,\u201d the president told reporters last week when asked about Mr. Mattis\u2019s comments in Mr. Woodward\u2019s book. \u201cWe\u2019re very happy with him. We\u2019re having victories people don\u2019t even know about.\u201d\nAs for Mr. Mattis, \u201cthere\u2019s no daylight between the secretary and the president when it comes to the unwavering support of our military,\u201d said Dana W. White, the Pentagon press secretary. \u201cIt\u2019s up to the president of the United States to decide what he wants to do.\u201d", "date": "Sept. 15, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/15/us/politics/jim-mattis-trump-defense-relationship.html", "tags": "put doubt fate defense pentagon fraying president secretary jim trump mattis ties \u2014"}
