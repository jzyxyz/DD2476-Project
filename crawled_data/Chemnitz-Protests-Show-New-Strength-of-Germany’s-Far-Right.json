{"title": "Chemnitz Protests Show New Strength of Germany\u2019s Far Right", "content": "CHEMNITZ, Germany \u2014 Waving German flags, with some flashing Nazi salutes, the angry mob made its way through the streets, chasing after dark-skinned bystanders as police officers, vastly outnumbered, were too afraid to intervene.\nA Syrian refugee and father of two, Anas al-Nahlawie, watched horrified from a friend\u2019s fourth-floor balcony. They were hunting in packs for immigrants just like him, he said. \u201cLike wolves.\u201d\nFor a few perilous hours over two days this week, the mob owned the streets of Chemnitz, where anger exploded after word spread that an Iraqi and a Syrian asylum seeker were suspected in a knife attack that killed a German man early Sunday.\nChemnitz, a city of some 250,000 in eastern Germany, has a history of neo-Nazi protests. Usually they draw a few hundred from the fringes of society \u2014 and far larger counter-demonstrations, city officials say. The crowd this time was 8,000-strong. Led by several hundred identifiable neo-Nazis, it appeared to be joined by thousands of ordinary citizens. More marches are planned Saturday.\nThe city had never seen anything like this \u2014 and, to some degree, neither had post-World War II Germany. The rampage now stands as a high-water mark in the outpouring of anti-immigrant hatred that has swelled as Germany struggles to absorb the nearly one million asylum seekers who arrived in the country after Chancellor Angela Merkel decided to open the borders in 2015.\nThat decision sharply divided Germany, with critics soon arguing that Ms. Merkel\u2019s administration had lost control of the situation. Three years later, what the government is struggling to control is an anti-immigrant backlash.\nNeo-Nazis are growing bolder and stronger, and they are better organized, officials and sociologists say. The far-right Alternative for Germany party is a growing power in Parliament \u2014 another shock to the system \u2014 and has started to normalize angry sentiments about immigrants that before would not have been uttered aloud, bringing them into the mainstream.\nIn the face of this newly assertive far right, Chemnitz has become a test of state authority. Some say it has even become a test of Germany\u2019s postwar democracy.\n\u201cThey are challenging our democratic state in a way they have not done before,\u201d said Barbara Ludwig, the mayor of Chemnitz, a Social Democrat, sitting in her second-floor city hall office one recent morning. \u201cWe must pass this test.\u201d\nThat is precisely what the groups behind this week\u2019s disorder see: A pivotal moment they want to use to change the direction of Germany.\nBenjamin Jahn Zschocke, 32, a leading member of Pro Chemnitz, the nationalist citizens\u2019 movement that registered Monday\u2019s march, described the week\u2019s events as a turning point and drew two historical parallels.\nJust as the death of a student demonstrator in 1967 set off widespread rioting and ultimately a student revolt that marked the beginning of the liberal progressive era in West Germany, the murder in Chemnitz would mark the beginning of a period of far-right resistance, he predicted.\nAnd just as in 1989, when thousands \u2014 including his own parents \u2014 took to the streets to demand the end of Communism, this week\u2019s marches were aimed at bringing down a \u201cfailed system,\u201d he said.\n\u201cPeople were sick of the system then and now they are sick of the system again,\u201d he said, adding that he had never voted and did not believe in parliamentary democracy.\nMayor Ludwig says the comparison hurts. She, too, marched in 1989. \u201cBut we marched for law and order, for democracy, for freedom of speech,\u201d she said. \u201cThey want to undermine all of these institutions and are instrumentalizing people\u2019s grief over the terrible murder of a young man.\u201d\nA thriving industrial hub in the 19th century, Chemnitz was badly damaged during World War II, then rebuilt as a model socialist city under East Germany\u2019s Communist regime and temporarily renamed Karl-Marx-Town.\nThe 7-meter-tall bronze head of Marx in the city center was once a rallying point for demonstrations that took place each Monday to demand the end of Communism; this week it was the rallying point of the far right.\nNeo-Nazis have a long tradition of holding demonstrations in Chemnitz, the mayor said. For years they would take to the streets on March 5, mourning the day the city was bombed by allied forces in 1945. \u201cBut they were always in the hundreds, and the counter-demonstration was always bigger,\u201d Ms. Ludwig said.\nThis week was different.\n\u201cThis mix of far-right extremists and AfD voters was new,\u201d said Hajo Funke, a political scientist at the Free University of Berlin and a veteran expert of the far right.\nThe Alternative for Germany garnered 27 percent in the eastern state of Saxony, where Chemnitz is located, in last year\u2019s national election. Empowered by that success, far-right activists have been able to channel the fears and discontent of voters and, often using social media, mobilize crowds that a few years ago would have been unthinkable, Mr. Funke said.\nThe events in Chemnitz, analysts say, showcase the symbiotic relationship between the neo-Nazis and the Alternative for Germany, which officially distances itself from such groups.\nThe party has done a lot to normalize the language of the far right. If the slogans heard on the streets of Chemnitz this week \u2014 from \u201clying press\u201d to \u201cGermany for the Germans\u201d \u2014 have lost their shock value, it is because variations of them are now regularly heard in Parliament.\n\u201cWe have a strong neo-Nazi scene in eastern Germany, but we also have a strong current of far-right extremism in all of Germany \u2014 not just in Parliament but in society,\u201d said Matthias Quent, who runs an institute that studies democracy and civil society in the eastern state of Thuringia.\nThat is why the far right is so self-confident, he said: \u201cThey think their day has come.\u201d\nSocial media played a significant role in mobilizing the mobs.\nWithin hours of the stabbing last Sunday, soccer hooligans with links to the neo-Nazis posted an appeal online: \u201cLet\u2019s show together who has the say in this city.\u201d\nSoon rumors started circulating. The victim had been defending a woman who had been molested by the killer. A second victim had died in hospital. Neither was true. But within a few hours, some 800 protesters were on the streets, outnumbering the police 10 to one.\nThe AfD was quick to chime in. \u201cWhen the state can\u2019t protect its citizens anymore, the citizens take to the street and protect themselves,\u201d Markus Frohnmaier, a lawmaker for the party, said in a Twitter post. \u201cToday it is a citizen\u2019s duty to stop the deadly \u2018knife migration!\u2019 \u201d\nOn Monday, the number of protesters grew tenfold, again catching the police unprepared and again making national headlines with riotous scenes of street battles. Another march on Thursday was much smaller, and largely calm, after the local police were reinforced with federal units.\nThe mass mobilizations highlight worrying new gains for an extremist fringe that for many years was underestimated and \u2014 some say willfully \u2014 neglected by the German authorities.\nThe feeling of insecurity was palpable this week in Chemnitz across neighborhoods and communities.\nAt the scene of Sunday\u2019s murder, a stone\u2019s throw from City Hall, Wolfgang Grosser, 61, and his wife, Sabine, were lighting a candle. They had known the victim. He was a friend of their son\u2019s, and once helped them move house.\n\u201cHe did not deserve this,\u201d Mr. Grosser said. \u201cHe was the nicest possible human being.\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t feel safe in our own city anymore,\u201d he said to the bitter nods of bystanders.\n\u201cNo one bothers calling the police anymore,\u201d Mr. Grosser said. \u201cThey are totally overwhelmed and don\u2019t come anyway. So what\u2019s the point?\u201d\nIt is a feeling shared by refugees in Chemnitz.\nMahmoud, a 19-year-old Syrian, who declined to give his last name for fear of being targeted by the far right, said the manhunts witnessed on the streets of Chemnitz in recent days were \u201cnothing unusual.\u201d\n\u201cI have been chased before, and so have my friends,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce we called the police, but nothing happened. So the next time we didn\u2019t.\u201d\nSome accused the authorities of leaking sensitive information about the suspects to the far right. On Tuesday night, the arrest warrant for one of the murder suspects was posted online by three far-right groups. It gave the full names of the suspects, the victim, witnesses and the judge involved.\nOn Thursday, a corrections officer admitted to sending the warrant to Pro Chemnitz, according to the German media, and was suspended from his duties.\nAfter the first round of violence on Sunday, refugee organizations warned migrants to stay inside.\nMr. Nahlawie said he had heeded the call. But one of his neighbors, a Bulgarian, did not. He was sitting in a cafe with his family on Sunday afternoon, he said, when he suddenly found a knife at the back of his neck.\nThe police swiftly intervened.\nStill, Mr. Nahlawie says, he worries. When he fled the war in Syria in 2015, he took his wife and young children to Germany \u2014 and to safety. Or so he thought.\n\u201cI\u2019m again afraid for my family,\u201d he said.", "date": "Aug. 30, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/30/world/europe/germany-neo-nazi-protests-chemnitz.html", "tags": "protests strength germany show city week \u201d streets right new \u2014 far chemnitz"}
