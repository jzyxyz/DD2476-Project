{"title": "Democrats Subpoena The Full Mueller Report And Supporting Evidence", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2015 House Democrats have issued a subpoena to Attorney General William Barr, demanding that he produce an unredacted version of Robert Mueller\u2019s special counsel report as well as a plethora of documents referenced in the report.\nRep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), who chairs the House Judiciary Committee, said he was willing to work with the Justice Department to \u201creach a reasonable accommodation for access\u201d to the evidence Mueller developed but said he \u201ccannot accept any proposal which leaves Congress in the dark.\u201d\n\u201cWe have so far seen none of the actual evidence that the Special Counsel developed to make this case. Even the redacted version of the report outlines serious instances of wrongdoing by President Trump and some of his closest associates,\u201d Nadler said in a statement, adding that it \u201cfalls to Congress to determine the full scope of that alleged misconduct and to decide what steps we must take going forward.\u201d\nNadler asked Barr to produce the documents before May 1. Barr had indicated he was willing to testify before the House Judiciary Committee on May 2.\nBarr wrote in a letter to Nadler and Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) on Thursday that they and the \u201cgang of eight\u201d \u2015 House and Senate leadership as well as the chairs and ranking members of the House and Senate intelligence committees \u2015 could have access to a less-redacted version of the Mueller report starting next week.\nJustice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said Friday evening that Nadler\u2019s subpoena was \u201cpremature and unnecessary.\u201d She said the report was released with \u201cminimal redactions\u201d and that Nadler and other top leaders could \u201creview the report with even fewer redactions.\u201d She said DOJ \u201cwill continue to work with Congress to accommodate its legitimate requests consistent with the law and long-recognized executive branch interests.\u201d\nRead the subpoena below.\nThis story has been updated with more details on the subpoena and comment from the Justice Department.", "date": "\n04/19/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/democrats-subpoena-mueller-report-trump_n_5cb9c916e4b032e7ceb78362", "tags": "evidence report full democrats nadler \u201d house \u2015 barr supporting subpoena version mueller"}
