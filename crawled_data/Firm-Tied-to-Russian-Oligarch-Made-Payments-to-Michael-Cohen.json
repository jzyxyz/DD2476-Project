{"title": "Firm Tied to Russian Oligarch Made Payments to Michael Cohen", "content": "A shell company that Michael D. Cohen used to pay hush money to a pornographic film actress received payments totaling more than $1 million from an American company linked to a Russian oligarch and several corporations with business before the Trump administration, according to documents and interviews.\nFinancial records reviewed by The New York Times show that Mr. Cohen, President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer and longtime fixer, used the shell company, Essential Consultants L.L.C., for an array of business activities that went far beyond what was publicly known. Transactions adding up to at least $4.4 million flowed through Essential Consultants starting shortly before Mr. Trump was elected president and continuing to this January, the records show.\nAmong the previously unreported transactions were payments last year of about $500,000 from Columbus Nova, an investment firm in New York whose biggest client is a company controlled by Viktor Vekselberg, the Russian oligarch. A lawyer for Columbus Nova, in a statement on Tuesday, described the money as a consulting fee that had nothing to do with Mr. Vekselberg.\nOther transactions described in the financial records include hundreds of thousands of dollars Mr. Cohen received from Fortune 500 companies with business before the Trump administration, as well as smaller amounts he paid for luxury expenses like a Mercedes-Benz and private club dues.\nReferences to the transactions first appeared in a document posted to Twitter on Tuesday by Michael Avenatti, the lawyer for Stephanie Clifford, the adult film star who was paid $130,000 by Essential Consultants to keep quiet about an alleged affair with Mr. Trump. The lawyer\u2019s seven-page document, titled \u201cPreliminary Report of Findings,\u201d does not explain the source of his information but describes in detail dates, dollar amounts and parties involved in various dealings by Mr. Cohen and his company. Most of the transactions involved two banks: First Republic Bank and City National Bank.\nThe Times\u2019s review of financial records confirmed much of what was in Mr. Avenatti\u2019s report. In addition, a review of documents and interviews shed additional light on Mr. Cohen\u2019s dealings with the company connected to Mr. Vekselberg, who was stopped and questioned at an airport earlier this year by investigators for Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel examining Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\nTaken together, The Times\u2019s findings and Mr. Avenatti\u2019s report offer the most detailed picture yet on Mr. Cohen\u2019s business dealings and financial entanglements in the run-up to the election and its aftermath. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan are investigating Mr. Cohen for possible bank fraud and election-law violations, among other matters, according to people briefed on the investigation. Stephen Ryan, a lawyer representing Mr. Cohen, declined to comment.\nMs. Clifford, whose stage name is Stormy Daniels, is suing Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump to break her nondisclosure agreement related to the $130,000.\nIt is unclear whether that or any of the other transactions were improper, but Mr. Avenatti has asserted that Mr. Cohen\u2019s use of Essential Consultants potentially violated banking laws. The financial records indicate that at least some of the money that passed through Essential Consultants was from sources and in amounts that were inconsistent with the company\u2019s stated purpose.\nMr. Cohen also used the company to collect $250,000 after arranging payments in 2017 and 2018 by a major Republican donor, Elliott Broidy, to a former Playboy model he allegedly impregnated, according to news reports last month.\nAmong the other payments to Mr. Cohen\u2019s company described in the financial records were four for $99,980 each between October and January by Novartis Investments S.A.R.L., a subsidiary of Novartis, the multinational pharmaceutical giant based in Switzerland. Novartis \u2014 whose chief executive was among 15 business leaders invited to dinner with Mr. Trump at the World Economic Forum in January \u2014 spent more than $10 million on lobbying in Washington last year and frequently seeks approvals from federal drug regulators. Novartis said in a statement that its agreement with Essential Consultants had expired.\nIn addition, Korea Aerospace Industries paid Mr. Cohen\u2019s company $150,000 last November, according to the records. The company, an aircraft manufacturer, has teamed with the American defense contractor Lockheed Martin in competing for a multibillion-dollar contract to provide trainer jets for the United States Air Force that is expected to be awarded this year. A representative for Korea Aerospace declined to comment.\nAT&T made four payments totaling $200,000 between October 2017 and January 2018, according to the documents. AT&T, whose proposed merger with Time Warner is pending before the Justice Department, issued a statement on Tuesday evening confirming that it made payments to Mr. Cohen\u2019s firm.\n\u201cEssential Consulting was one of several firms we engaged in early 2017 to provide insights into understanding the new administration,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThey did no legal or lobbying work for us, and the contract ended in December 2017.\u201d\nThe payments by Columbus Nova occurred between January and August of last year. Andrew Intrater, the company\u2019s American chief executive and Mr. Vekselberg\u2019s cousin, donated $250,000 to Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, campaign finance records show. He and Mr. Vekselberg attended the event together and met with Mr. Cohen there, according to a person briefed on the matter. Columbus Nova retained him as a consultant soon afterward.\nThe consulting deal was worth $1 million and was supposed to last for a year, according to documents reviewed by The Times. But Columbus Nova decided to end the agreement midway through after it yielded a few investment ideas but no actual deals.\nA person close to Mr. Intrater said that the executive had no idea Essential Consultants was used for the separate payment to Ms. Clifford, and that he hired a number of other consultants at the time for similar prices.\n\u201cColumbus Nova is an investment management company solely owned and controlled by Americans,\u201d said Richard Owens, a lawyer for Mr. Intrater and Columbus Nova, adding that Mr. Vekselberg has never owned the firm. \u201cAfter the inauguration, the firm hired Michael Cohen as a business consultant regarding potential sources of capital and potential investments in real estate and other ventures.\n\u201cReports today that Viktor Vekselberg used Columbus Nova as a conduit for payments to Michael Cohen are false. The claim that Viktor Vekselberg was involved in or provided any funding for Columbus Nova\u2019s engagement of Michael Cohen is patently untrue,\u201d Mr. Owens said. \u201cNeither Viktor Vekselberg nor anyone else outside of Columbus Nova was involved in the decision to hire Cohen or provided funding for his engagement.\u201d\nA lawyer for Mr. Vekselberg did not respond to a request for comment.\nIn addition to questioning Mr. Vekselberg, Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigators have also interviewed Mr. Intrater, though there is no indication that either man is suspected of wrongdoing, The Times reported last week.\nThe person close to Mr. Intrater said that he was encouraged to attend the inauguration by an American friend, unrelated to Mr. Cohen, and that he had wanted to use the trip as an opportunity to meet with business associates in Washington.\nMr. Vekselberg has invested in Columbus Nova\u2019s private equity funds through his sprawling Russian-based conglomerate, the Renova Group, which operates in the energy sector and elsewhere. Mr. Vekselberg was one of seven Kremlin-linked oligarchs hit with sanctions in April by the Trump administration, which also imposed the penalties on the Renova Group.\nRenova has had a financial relationship with VTB, one of the largest state-owned banks in Russia, according to documents that were part of the \u201cPanama Papers\u201d leak of files from an offshore law firm. The documents show that Mr. Vekselberg\u2019s companies received at least $350 million in loans or investments from VTB and a subsidiary, VTB Capital. The current state of the debt is unclear, though one document suggests it was discharged in 2010.\nMr. Cohen created Essential Consultants in Delaware less than two weeks before he completed his deal with Ms. Clifford, who is now contesting her contract with Mr. Cohen as invalid. Mr. Cohen initially said he paid her out of his own pocket by way of a home equity line of credit.\nBut last week, former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York said that Mr. Trump had reimbursed Mr. Cohen through several $35,000 monthly transactions that amounted to more than $400,000 \u2014 covering the payment to Ms. Clifford and, he said, other \u201cincidental expenses.\u201d", "date": "May 8, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/us/politics/michael-cohen-shell-company-payments.html", "tags": "company oligarch consultants russian tied essential nova columbus cohen vekselberg michael firm made payments"}
