{"title": "Mueller Report Explains Why Special Counsel Didn't Subpoena Donald Trump", "content": "Special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report, a redacted version of which was released publicly Thursday, explains why President Donald Trump wasn\u2019t subpoenaed as part of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\u201cRecognizing that the President would not be interviewed voluntarily, we considered whether to issue a subpoena for his testimony,\u201d the report reads. \u201cWe viewed the written answers to be inadequate. But at that point our investigation had made significant progress and had produced substantial evidence for our report.\u201d \nThe report said the special counsel\u2019s office had \u201cweighed the costs\u201d of a potentially long legal battle to obtain an interview with Trump versus the value of completing the investigation sooner. The office concluded that the \u201csubstantial quality of information we had obtained from other sources\u201d would allow it to draw the conclusions it sought \u201con intent and credibility.\u201d\nDuring Mueller\u2019s investigation, which took nearly two years, the special counsel\u2019s office issued more than 2,800 subpoenas, per the report. \nThe special counsel repeatedly sought to interview Trump. At one point early 2018, an in-person interview had been scheduled, but was later canceled by Trump\u2019s legal team. In May 2018, Mueller reportedly threatened Trump\u2019s lawyers that he could subpoena Trump if the White House refused a sit-down interview. \nUltimately Trump submitted written answers to some of Mueller\u2019s questions in late November. The president reportedly only answered questions related to Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election, and not about whether he tried to obstruct the investigation into his campaign\u2019s potential links with Russian meddling. \nAttorney General William Barr gave a press conference on Mueller\u2019s report early Thursday \u2015 hours before its release to the public \u2015 going to bat for Trump and echoing the president\u2019s refrain that there was \u201cno collusion\u201d during the 2016 election.\nThe Trump-picked attorney general\u2019s decision to speak on the redacted report before it was sent to Congress drew fierce criticism from Democratic lawmakers, who then requested that Mueller testify about his findings before the House Judiciary Committee by next month. \nThe Russia probe led to dozens of Russian operatives and some of the president\u2019s top men being charged with various crimes, with guilty pleas secured from former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn, former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former Trump personal lawyer Michael Cohen, among others.
