{"title": "Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin to Separate After His Latest Sexting Scandal", "content": "It was supposed to be a quiet, late-summer weekend on the exclusive shores of the Hamptons. But on Sunday, Huma Abedin, the closest aide to Hillary Clinton, received devastating news.\nAfter accompanying Mrs. Clinton to fund-raisers, Ms. Abedin learned from her husband, Anthony D. Weiner, that The New York Post was about to report that he had again exchanged lewd messages with a woman on social media: the sort of behavior that destroyed his congressional career and 2013 mayoral campaign.\nOnly this time, the online indiscretions included an image of Mr. Weiner\u2019s crotch as he lay next to the couple\u2019s 4-year-old son.\nNow, Mr. Weiner\u2019s tawdry activities may have claimed his marriage \u2014 Ms. Abedin told him that she wanted to separate \u2014 and have cast another shadow on the adviser and confidante who has been by Mrs. Clinton\u2019s side for the past two decades. Ms. Abedin was already a major figure this summer in controversies over Mrs. Clinton\u2019s handling of classified information as secretary of state and over ties between the Clinton family foundation and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s State Department.\nMr. Weiner\u2019s extramarital behavior also threatens to remind voters about the troubles in the Clintons\u2019 own marriage over the decades, including Mrs. Clinton\u2019s much-debated decision to remain with then-President Bill Clinton after revelations of his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. Ms. Abedin\u2019s choice to separate from her husband evokes the debates that erupted over Mrs. Clinton\u2019s handling of the Lewinsky affair, a scandal her campaign wants left in the past.\nClinton advisers expressed only sympathy for Ms. Abedin on Monday and said they were confident Mr. Weiner\u2019s actions would not hurt Mrs. Clinton, who learned about them from Ms. Abedin and offered support. But Mr. Weiner\u2019s behavior quickly became fodder for Donald J. Trump, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s Republican opponent in the presidential race.\n\u201cHuma is making a very wise decision,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a statement. \u201cI know Anthony Weiner well, and she will be far better off without him.\u201d\nHe then went further, claiming that the marriage\u2019s breakdown was a matter of national security. Mrs. Clinton received her first intelligence briefing as the Democratic presidential nominee on Saturday at the F.B.I. field office in White Plains. No aides accompanied her to the briefing, according to a campaign official.\n\u201cI only worry for the country in that Hillary Clinton was careless and negligent in allowing Weiner to have such close proximity to highly classified information,\u201d Mr. Trump said, using language that echoed criticism of Mrs. Clinton this summer by the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey Jr. \u201cWho knows what he learned and who he told? It\u2019s just another example of Hillary Clinton\u2019s bad judgment. It is possible that our country and its security have been greatly compromised by this.\u201d\nA spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, Nick Merrill, declined to comment on Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks.\nThe spotlight on Ms. Abedin and her proximity to Mrs. Clinton has been an increasing distraction for the campaign.\nSeveral of Ms. Abedin\u2019s emails on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s private server have drawn scrutiny amid accusations that donors to the Clinton Foundation received special access to the State Department.\nAnd political opponents, including Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, have questioned Ms. Abedin\u2019s arrangement to earn income privately while she worked for Mrs. Clinton at the State Department. In addition to being on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s personal payroll, Ms. Abedin received money from the Clinton Foundation and Teneo, a consulting firm founded in part by Douglas J. Band, previously a senior aide to Mr. Clinton.\nMs. Abedin, 40, has been at Mrs. Clinton\u2019s side since she was an intern to the first lady in the 1990s. Now vice chairwoman of the Clinton campaign, Ms. Abedin, often described as a surrogate daughter, occupies an almost singular role as a trusted, and visible, confidante to Mrs. Clinton.\nTheir lives took similar tracks, as both women, citing their religious beliefs, seemed determined to remain married despite their husbands\u2019 sexual proclivities.\nMrs. Clinton strongly supported Ms. Abedin when Mr. Weiner\u2019s sexually charged text messages came to light in 2011, a year into their marriage, and again in 2013, when Mr. Weiner was running for mayor of New York. Friends of Mrs. Clinton said that she had spoken to Ms. Abedin at length about the marriage and that she supported Ms. Abedin\u2019s decision to remain with Mr. Weiner and work on their relationship.\nThe couple\u2019s marital problems have been a subject of years of tabloid mockery and humiliation since Mr. Weiner resigned from Congress in 2011 amid revelations that he had sent sexual images of himself to women on social media. His 2013 campaign for mayor was damaged, too, when Mr. Weiner admitted that he had continued flirting with women online.\nBy Monday morning, when the Post cover showing Mr. Weiner and his son, Jordan, hit newsstands, Mr. Weiner had left the Hamptons for New York City aware that Ms. Abedin planned to announce their separation, said two people close to the couple who discussed private conversations on the condition of anonymity.\n\u201cAfter long and painful consideration and work on my marriage, I have made the decision to separate from my husband,\u201d Ms. Abedin said in a statement. \u201cAnthony and I remain devoted to doing what is best for our son, who is the light of our life. During this difficult time, I ask for respect for our privacy.\u201d\nIn the latest issue of Vogue, Ms. Abedin portrayed Mr. Weiner as a devoted father and their marriage as a true partnership. \u201cMany working moms feel this way \u2014 there is a lot of guilt,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could do it if I didn\u2019t have the full support system I have, if Anthony wasn\u2019t willing to be, essentially, a full-time dad.\u201d\nBut the two people close to the couple said Ms. Abedin and Mr. Weiner had been growing apart for some time, with Ms. Abedin often on the campaign trail with Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Weiner at home with Jordan. They said the Post article had not caused a sudden and unexpected rupture to a happy marriage, but rather was the final catalyst for Ms. Abedin to move for a separation.\nCampaign officials had braced for new revelations about Mr. Weiner after The Post reported this month that a Republican had baited Mr. Weiner into a flirtatious online chat. Asked by The New York Times this month whether he was still engaging in the behavior that had foiled his political career, Mr. Weiner said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to go down the path of talking about any of that.\u201d\nMrs. Clinton had hoped to ride out the final week of August with limited distractions as she seeks to maintain her solid lead in national polls. On Monday, she attended three fund-raisers in the Hamptons, without Ms. Abedin, and spoke briefly on a conference call with policy experts and medical providers to unveil her proposals on mental health.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to make clear mental health is not a personal failing,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said.\nAides said that Ms. Abedin\u2019s marriage was a private matter and that her decision to announce the separation meant the frenetic news cycle would soon move on.\n\u201cThe best way to get rid of a problem is to get rid of a problem,\u201d said Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic consultant. \u201cThe end of that marriage publicly announced makes it impossible for Anthony Weiner to have anything to do with the campaign.\u201d\nBut unlike many political aides, Ms. Abedin has become a public figure in her own right, posing for Vogue, snapping selfies with voters on the rope line at Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign events and hosting her own fund-raisers on her boss\u2019s behalf.\nHours after Ms. Abedin released her statement, Showtime blasted out a news release announcing the October television debut of \u201cWeiner,\u201d an unfettered documentary about the implosion of Mr. Weiner\u2019s mayoral campaign and the couple\u2019s interactions after his second scandal.\nIn the messages reported by The Post, Mr. Weiner exchanged photos with a woman. She appeared in various bikinis, and Mr. Weiner was half-dressed, showing off his stomach or his groin \u2014 and they talked about sex.\nIn one message, Mr. Weiner abruptly changed the discussion from massage parlors and reportedly wrote, \u201cSomeone just climbed into my bed.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d the woman replied.\nHis response, in a screen shot dated July 31, 2015, showed a child curled up next to Mr. Weiner, who was wearing only white briefs.", "date": "Aug. 29, 2016", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/30/nyregion/anthony-weiner-sexting-huma-abedin.html", "tags": "latest weiner scandal clinton separate \u201d sexting mrs. abedin ms. anthony campaign huma"}
