{"title": "Chibok girls: What fate awaits the ones set free?", "content": "There was huge relief when 82 of the girls kidnapped by Islamist militants Boko Haram in Chibok, north-east Nigeria, in 2014 were freed on Saturday. But, as the BBC's Alastair Leithead has been finding out, they may still not be able to go back home.\nThe ordeal of being kidnapped by Boko Haram does not end with the release of the captives. In fact, it is just the start of a long struggle back into family and community life.\nCaptured as children, the Chibok girls, as they have come to be known, are being freed as young women. An already fraught transition from adolescence to womanhood complicated by their captivity.\nThe 82 will, albeit briefly, be reunited with their families over the coming days.\nA representative from the group of Chibok parents has visited them, to check their identities against the list of those freed, and to tell those waiting for confirmation either the good or the bad news.\nMost relatives are still living in the remote town of Chibok, 900km (600 miles) north-east of the capital, Abuja. And it will be a long but joyous journey for those told to come.\nThere will be tearful reunions and a mixture of emotions as both parents and daughters will have changed a great deal over the past three years.\nAnd then what?\nIf the treatment of the 21 girls released last October, and the few who escaped, is a guide, the young women will go through a process of re-integration or rehabilitation.\nThis is either government care or government custody depending on the point of view.\nSome families support the process, others are angry that more than six months after being released from Boko Haram, they still do not have their children back.\nOne of the parents who visited a secure government facility in the capital, Abuja, last week said they are being treated well and are living comfortably.\n\"I was happy with the conditions the girls are staying in. They are doing fine,\" said Ali Maiyanga Askira who went to see his daughter Maryam.\n\"I wish she was with us, but I couldn't take care of her as well as the government is.\n\"They are teaching vocational work like tailoring and knitting, and they are also taking lessons. \n\"The minister of education told us in the next four months they would go back to school.\n\"I am happy with whatever decision the government takes,\" he said.\nBut some other families just want their girls back.\nThere was anger at Christmas when they were brought to Chibok to meet relatives, but were not allowed home.\nThey were taken to a local politician's house and their families were only allowed to visit them for a short time.\n\"I can't believe my daughter has come this close to home, but can't come home,\" said one father at the time.\nBut the chairman of the Chibok community in Abuja, Tsambido Hosea, said parents were being invited to visit Abuja in small groups.\n\"They are in a rehabilitation centre. The government says it is giving them some instruction so they will be ready to go to school,\" he said.\nAs to whether they are allowed to go home or not, the community doesn't care that they are being held by the government.\n\"We know they are in the hands of people we know, that we can call, to answer at any moment. It's different from when they were in the hands of the terrorists.\"\nPsychologists who have worked with those previously released from the Islamist group said family therapy rather than isolation would be a better way of reintegrating them.\nBut there is also the suspicion that the former captives are not being allowed home because the huge publicity around the case could make them targets for kidnapping again.\nThere have been times when those, not from the Chibok group, who were allowed home without proper psychological support have been alienated by their communities or even parts of their own families.\nSome converted from Christianity to Islam, and some were married to Boko Haram fighters and had children with them, leading them to be shunned.\nIt is clear that once the violence is over the militant's impact in the region will remain for a generation, unless those abducted can be quickly and effectively re-integrated in society.\nAt the moment though, those recently released will have to contemplate a future still far away from their families.\nWhat next for freed Chibok girls?\nWhat we know about the abductions\nThe town that lost its girls\nTorment of a freed Boko Haram 'bride'", "date": "10 May 2017", "href": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-39855519", "tags": "chibok fate set free haram awaits freed go home ones girls boko families government"}
