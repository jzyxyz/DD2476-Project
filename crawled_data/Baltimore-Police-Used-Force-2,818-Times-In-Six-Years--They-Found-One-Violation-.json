{"title": "Baltimore Police Used Force 2,818 Times In Six Years- They Found One Violation-", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2015 The Baltimore Police Department routinely abused residents\u2019 civil rights, performed unconstitutional searches, retaliated against individuals exercising free-speech rights and failed to hold cops accountable for misconduct, according to a damning federal report.\nThe Justice Department report, to be formally released on Wednesday, confirms what some Baltimore residents already know \u2015 that Baltimore police routinely and disproportionately stop, frisk and arrest poor black residents without legal justification. \n\u201cBaltimore\u2019s legacy of government-sanctioned discrimination, serious health hazards, and high rates of violent crime have persisted and compounded for years \u2015 making Baltimore a challenging city to police fairly and effectively,\u201d the report says.\nBaltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake requested the DOJ investigation of the police force in May 2015 after 25-year-old Freddie Gray, a black man, sustained a spinal injury following a rough ride in a police van and later died.\u00a0Protests and riots rocked the city following Gray\u2019s funeral, which residents said police handled with unnecessary aggression.\u00a0\nAs the federal probe got underway, police equipped officers with body cameras, installed cameras in police vans, and provided commanders with additional training.\u00a0Criminal charges were filed against six officers involved in Gray\u2019s death. After three were acquitted, Baltimore State\u2019s Attorney Marilyn Mosby last month\u00a0dropped the charges against the remaining three officers.\u00a0The DOJ report is likely a step in a reform process that will hold the police department accountable for making changes.\nDOJ investigators found a police force infected by an \u201cus-versus-them\u201d mentality, with officers throughout the chain of command who \u201copenly harbor antagonistic feelings towards community members.\u201d \nWhen asked about community policing, one supervisor said he didn\u2019t \u201cpander to the public,\u201d while another said he approaches Baltimore like a war zone. Officers told investigators they see themselves as controlling the city, rather than being a part of it, and said that many commanders\u00a0\u201cview themselves as enforcing the will of the \u2018silent majority.\u2019\u201d One patrol officer emphasized the importance of being able to \u201cown\u201d the block.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be the baddest motherfucker out there,\u201d the officer said.\nThe report said Baltimore\u2019s \u201czero-tolerance\u201d policing strategies, which are outdated and ineffective \u201ctough-on-crime\u201d policies, disproportionately target black people and Latinos. Black people make up 63 percent of the city\u2019s population, but 86 percent of those charged with crimes.\nOfficers use force even when not required, according to the report. Police reported they used force 2,818 times over a six-year period, but internal reviewers flagged only 10 as worth investigating. Police found just one was an instance of excessive force. \nOfficers made at least 300,000 pedestrian stops from January 2010 to May 2015 \u2015 most without reasonable suspicion, the report says. A\u00a0black man was stopped crossing the street while wearing a hoodie in January 2013. The arresting officer \u201cthought it could be possible that the individual could be out seeking a victim of opportunity,\u201d according to the report.\u00a0\nAbout 44 percent of the stops were made in two black neighborhoods that include 11 percent of the city\u2019s population of 620,000. The report says many people were stopped at least 10 times. Seven men, the report says, each were stopped more than 30 times.\nHaving a federal official in the patrol car apparently was not enough to stop officers from constitutional violations, according to the report:\u00a0\nIf someone complained about police misconduct, it was handled by\u00a0a deeply flawed internal affairs system rigged in favor of officers. Investigators found \u201ca persistent failure to discipline officers for misconduct, even in cases of repeated or egregious violations,\u201d the report says. Officers were discouraged from reporting misconduct and \u201ca cultural resistance to accountability has developed and been reinforced.\u201d\u00a0\nWhen one individual complained that an officer grabbed him by the neck and called him a \u201cpunk ass faggot\u201d in 2013, for example, supervisors tossed the complaint because the victim didn\u2019t show up in person to have his statement notarized.\nWhen an officer shot a person to death in 2013, an internal affairs detective interviewed the officer for five minutes, only three minutes of which were substantive. Internal affairs investigators also had a practice of conducting \u201cpre-interviews\u201d to allow officers to practice before their words were recorded.\nThe report cites the case of an officer who had previously been accused of having sex with a prostitute in exchange for money and immunity from arrest. After the officer again came under investigation for allegedly having sex in his patrol vehicle with a person in the sex trade, the detective assigned to investigate was told to subpoena phone records. The detective waited a month to do so, then didn\u2019t review the records for six months, according to the report. No charges were filed, but the officer eventually resigned after he came under investigation once again.\nThe report says an entire squad of officers was on the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office \u201cdo not call,\u201d which means prosecutors considered them non-credible and not to be called to testify. Those officers remained on the streets, \u201cmaking arrests that could not be credibly prosecuted,\u201d according to the report.\nOfficers told investigators they believed that \u201cdiscipline is only imposed if an incident makes it into the press or if you were on the wrong side of a supervisor, not because of the magnitude of the misconduct.\u201d\nRead the entire DOJ report\u00a0below.\u00a0", "date": "\n08/09/2016", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/baltimore-police-doj-report_n_57aa6844e4b0ba7ed23e1c46", "tags": "officers report baltimore used years- violation- officer force \u201d one times found according black says six police"}
