We want to talk about jobs. We want to talk about the military. We want to talk about ISIS and get rid of ISIS.\u201d\nWatch the full interview here.\nTrump spent years fanning the flames of the birther conspiracy, going so far as to claim he had sent investigators to Hawaii to dig into Obama\u2019s background. (There\u2019s no evidence he actually did this.) Despite the issue having zero credibility \u2015 Obama publicly released his birth certificate in 2011, and there was never any legitimate reason to doubt his birthplace in Hawaii \u2015 Trump refused to dismiss it until last week.\u00a0\nThe GOP candidate clung to the claim as recently as last Thursday,\u00a0when he refused to say whether he believed Obama was born in the U.S.\n\u201cI\u2019ll answer that question at the right time,\u201d he said. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to answer it yet.\u201d\u00a0\nWhen he did finally disavow the theory, he did so by falsely claiming Hillary Clinton was the true originator of the birthplace rumors \u2015 a claim that has been widely debunked. He also made no effort to acknowledge his role in spreading the birther myth, nor did he apologize to Obama for perpetuating the falsehood.\u00a0\nClinton\u2019s campaign quickly responded to Trump\u2019s latest comments, saying they show he \u201chasn\u2019t actually changed his mind\u201d about the birther myth.\n\u201cHe only gave his 36 second press statement last week to try to change the subject \u2015 and it didn\u2019t work,\u201d Clinton spokesman Jesse Ferguson said in a statement.\nAlso on HuffPost: Trump\u2019s Latest Reversal Doesn\u2019t Erase His Racist Crusade Against The First Black President\nEditor\u2019s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe,\u00a0racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims \u2014 1.6 billion members of an entire religion \u2014 from entering the U.S.", "date": "\n09/21/2016", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-birther_n_57e31b1be4b0e80b1ba04348?7i5ir4bn4b1emi", "tags": "birtherism want gave \u201c birther trump \u2015 finally donald says obama birthplace get campaign"}
