{"title": "Trump Judicial Nominee Refuses To Say If She Agrees With Desegregated Schools", "content": "Federal judicial nominee Wendy Vitter refused to say on Wednesday whether she agreed with the landmark civil rights case that desegregated U.S. public schools.\nDuring her confirmation hearing, Vitter, whom President Donald Trump nominated to become a federal judge in the Eastern District of Louisiana, would not say whether she believed the Supreme Court case, Brown v. Board of Education, was correctly decided when Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) asked her about it.\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean to be coy, but I think I get into a difficult area when I start commenting on Supreme Court decisions \u2015 which are correctly decided, which I disagree with. Again, my personal, political or religious views, I would set aside,\u201d she said, adding that she would uphold legal precedent.\nUndeterred,\u00a0Blumenthal repeated his question, which Vitter evaded again.\n\u201cRespectfully, I would not comment on what could be my boss\u2019 ruling, the Supreme Court,\u201d Vitter said. \u201cI would be bound by it. And if I start commenting on, \u2018I agree with this case, or don\u2019t agree with this case,\u2019 I think we get into a slippery slope.\u201d\nThe New Orleans lawyer\u2019s comments on segregation were not the only controversial moment of her confirmation hearing. A staunch opponent of abortion, Vitter also evaded Blumenthal\u2019s questions about comments she\u2019d made about Planned Parenthood killing more than 150,000 women a year.\nVitter\u2019s federal judgeship nomination is for a lifetime appointment.", "date": "\n04/11/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-judicial-nominee-segregation-wendy-vitter_n_5acea330e4b064876776a93d", "tags": "judicial vitter court nominee refuses \u201d trump desegregated say schools federal supreme case agrees blumenthal"}
