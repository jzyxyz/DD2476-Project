{"title": "Sen- Lindsey Graham Blasted For Encouraging Donald Trump Jr- To Ignore Senate Subpoena", "content": "Democrats tore into Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) after he suggested President Donald Trump\u2019s eldest son should refuse to answer questions from the Senate Intelligence Committee, which has subpoenaed him to testify about his communications with Russian officials.\u00a0\nGraham, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and a frequent Trump cheerleader, told reporters Monday that Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s attorney would \u201chave to be an idiot\u201d to let him testify.\n\u201cYou just show up and plead the Fifth and it\u2019s over with,\u201d Graham said, referring to the constitutional amendment that grants Americans the right to refuse self-incrimination.\nA day earlier, Graham told Fox News that Trump Jr. should consider ignoring the subpoena altogether.\n\u201cIf I were Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s lawyer, I would tell him, \u2018You don\u2019t need to go back into this environment anymore,\u2019\u201d Graham said. \u201cI would call it a day.\u201d\nGraham\u2019s remarks drew backlash from some Democratic lawmakers and prompted calls for his resignation from numerous Twitter users. The hashtag #LindseyGrahamResign was trending Tuesday on the social media platform.\n\u201cThis is not the Lindsey I know,\u201d Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.V.) told CNN on Monday. \u201cI can\u2019t explain what\u2019s going on right now in his thought process.\u201d\nRep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.) on Monday warned Trump Jr. not to take Graham\u2019s \u201cfree\u201d advice.\n\u201cIgnoring subpoenas is not a prudent course of action,\u201d\u00a0he told CNN.\nThe Senate could hold Trump Jr. in contempt of Congress if he were to ignore a subpoena, though such a scenario seems unlikely given Republicans\u2019 majority in the chamber.\nGraham said Tuesday that he doesn\u2019t believe Trump Jr. or anyone else is \u201cabove the law,\u201d but that he\u2019s\u00a0\u201cafraid that we\u2019re beginning to prosecute each other for political reasons.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want any part of that,\u201d he told reporters.\nSome Twitter users pointed out that Graham\u2019s comments marked a dramatic departure from what he has previously said about congressional subpoenas. He\u00a0declared on the House floor\u00a0in 1998 that a president\u2019s failure to comply with a subpoena from Congress is unconstitutional and grounds for impeachment.\nKevin Bishop, a spokesman for Graham, said, \u201cNo Collusion. No Obstruction. No Resignation.\u201d when HuffPost asked for comment on calls for the senator\u2019s resignation. He declined to comment on why Graham\u2019s stance on congressional subpoenas appears to have shifted over the years.\nRepresentatives for Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the top-ranking Democrat on the committee, declined to comment on Graham\u2019s remarks.\nCongressional committees have continued to investigate findings from special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election and whether Trump obstructed justice in the weeks after Mueller submitted his report.\nIn his report, Mueller said his team did not find evidence proving a criminal conspiracy between the campaign and the Kremlin. And though he stopped short of charging Trump with obstruction, he outlined 10 instances of possible obstruction by the president as the investigation proceeded.\nThe GOP-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee subpoenaed Trump Jr. last week after he reportedly backed out of two scheduled interviews. The committee wants to go over answers Trump Jr. gave to committee staffers during a 2017 interview related to Russian interference in the U.S. political process.\nTrump Jr. infamously set up a meeting with Russian operatives who claimed to have dirt on his father\u2019s Democratic challenger, Hillary Clinton, at Trump Tower in New York City during the 2016 election.\u00a0\nBurr told colleagues on Thursday during a luncheon that Trump Jr. had voluntarily agreed to be interviewed in March and April, but later withdrew, The Associated Press reported Tuesday.\nTrump Jr.\u2019s stance on cooperating with the panel changed after Mueller\u2019s investigation ended with no charges against him, AP reported, citing a person familiar with Trump Jr.\u2019s beliefs but not authorized to speak publicly about private conversations. His legal team also claimed the committee refused to negotiate the scope of the interviews, according to AP\u2019s report.\nTrump told reporters at the White House on Tuesday that he believes the Senate committee was being \u201cvery unfair\u201d to his son.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a tough situation because my son spent, I guess, over 20 hours testifying about something that Mueller said was 100% OK and now they want him to testify again,\u201d the president said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why. I have no idea why. But it seems very unfair to me.\u201d\nThis article has been updated with comments from Graham.\u00a0", "date": "\n05/14/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/lindsey-graham-donald-trump-jr_n_5cdad81ce4b0f7ba48ab81f4?1db", "tags": "jr. \u201c jr- encouraging committee blasted mueller trump lindsey ignore donald senate told sen- subpoena graham"}
