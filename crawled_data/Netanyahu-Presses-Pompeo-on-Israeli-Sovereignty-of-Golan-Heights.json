{"title": "Netanyahu Presses Pompeo on Israeli Sovereignty of Golan Heights", "content": "JERUSALEM \u2014 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pressed the United States to recognize Israeli governance of most of the Golan Heights during a visit by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday. His efforts underscored the growing possibility that the Trump administration may change the American stance on the territory.\nMr. Netanyahu has pushed repeatedly for the United States to recognize Israeli sovereignty over the western Golan Heights, which Israel seized from Syria in the Six Day War of 1967 and later annexed.\nThere are recent signs that the Trump administration could be moving in Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s direction. An annual human rights report released last Wednesday by the State Department used the phrase \u201cIsraeli-controlled\u201d rather than \u201cIsraeli-occupied\u201d to describe the Golan Heights, the West Bank and Gaza, counter to the tradition. The Trump administration has also pushed back against United Nations condemnations of Israel\u2019s occupation.\nMr. Netanyahu will visit Mr. Trump next week, the White House announced on Wednesday, a trip that could offer the prime minister\u2019s troubled re-election campaign a lift. Mr. Netanyahu also plans to speak at the annual conference of Aipac, the pro-Israel lobbying group.\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Pompeo appeared together to offer remarks to reporters following a one-on-one meeting in the prime minister\u2019s compound in Jerusalem.\nMr. Netanyahu said Israeli intelligence officials had discovered last week that Hezbollah, the Lebanese military and political group with ties to Iran, was trying to set up a network in the Syrian-controlled portion of the Golan Heights, posing a threat to Israel.\n\u201cI can say that all of you can imagine what would have happened if Israel were not in the Golan,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said. \u201cWe would have Iran on the shores of the Sea of Galilee. I think for this reason and for many more, I think it\u2019s time the international community recognizes Israel\u2019s stay in the Golan, the fact that the Golan will always remain part of the state of Israel.\u201d\nMr. Pompeo did not mention the Golan Heights, but he talked expansively about the need for the United States and Israel to work together to counter Iran and about the Trump administration\u2019s backing for Israel\u2019s security.\n\u201cWith such threats a daily reality of Israeli life, we maintain our unparalleled commitment to Israel\u2019s security and firmly support your right to defend yourselves,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said.\nMr. Netanyahu praised President Trump for withdrawing from the nuclear deal with Iran last year, a move Mr. Trump made even though American intelligence agencies said Iran had not been trying to build nuclear weapons. He also said American sanctions against Iran appeared to be working, adding that he and Mr. Pompeo had discussed in their meeting how to \u201cintensify the pressure even more.\u201d\nMr. Netanyahu could press the issue of the Golan Heights with Mr. Trump when he meets with him on Monday and Tuesday. Any big gesture by Mr. Trump could help Mr. Netanyahu in his bid for a fifth term in elections scheduled for April 9. But even being seen side by side with the American president could give Mr. Netanyahu a lift with some Israeli voters.\nA shadow has fallen over Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s chances since the Israeli attorney general announced last month that he intended to indict Mr. Netanyahu on bribery and other corruption charges.\nMany Israeli conservatives have applauded Mr. Trump\u2019s policies. He has recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and moved the United States Embassy there from Tel Aviv, and cut aid to Palestinian refugees. Last November, for the first time, the United States voted against a symbolic resolution that the United Nations issues annually that condemns Israel\u2019s presence in the Golan Heights.\nMr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has been working on a peace plan that many analysts say would take a hard-line approach toward traditional Palestinian demands.\nDespite the pre-election timing, Mr. Pompeo\u2019s visit got little coverage Wednesday night on Israel\u2019s top-rated evening news show.\nThere have been at least three occasions in the late 20th century when American presidents tried to influence Israeli elections, according to Aaron David Miller, a Middle East scholar at the Wilson Center who worked on Arab-Israeli negotiations as a State Department official. He cited efforts by President George Bush and then President Bill Clinton, one of which involved Mr. Clinton trying to boost Shimon Peres over Mr. Netanyahu.\n\u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s re-elect Netanyahu campaign is in full swing,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cPompeo\u2019s Israel stop \u2014 rare for a secretary of state this close to an Israeli election \u2014 is designed to show that the U.S. and Israel are in sync on policy, especially Iran.\u201d\nOn Wednesday morning, before flying to Israel, Mr. Pompeo held a news conference in Kuwait City with the foreign minister of Kuwait. An American reporter asked Mr. Pompeo for the exact position of the United States on the West Bank and Golan Heights: Were they or were they not occupied by Israel?\nMr. Pompeo said only \u201cthere\u2019s been no change in U.S. policy\u201d but did not lay out the policy.\nOn Monday night, a reporter accompanying Mr. Pompeo on the flight to Kuwait asked him whether the State Department had made a deliberate change to language in the human rights report by using \u201cIsraeli-controlled\u201d rather than \u201cIsraeli-occupied.\u201d\n\u201cThis was a factual statement about how we observe the situation,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said. \u201cAnd we think it\u2019s very accurate, and we stand behind it.\u201d\nLast year, the State Department\u2019s human rights report stopped using \u201coccupied\u201d in headlines on the West Bank and Gaza, but kept the word in the text.\nIn Lebanon, on the final stop of his trip, Mr. Pompeo plans to denounce Hezbollah.\nHe has also been pressuring Iraq to distance itself from neighboring Iran. That has raised tensions with Iraqi leaders and even with Pentagon and C.I.A. officials, who say Mr. Pompeo\u2019s hard-line stand on Iran was jeopardizing ties between the United States and Iraq, where 5,200 American troops are based. Mr. Pompeo had already strained ties with European allies over Iran policy.", "date": "March 20, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/20/world/middleeast/netanyahu-pompeo-golan.html", "tags": "heights united israel \u201d pompeo netanyahu sovereignty israeli golan presses"}
