{"title": "Letter from Africa: Cutting Nigeria's 'big men' down to size", "content": "In our series of letters from African journalists, novelist and writer Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani looks at the impact of new economising measures in Nigeria.\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, who came to office in May, seems bent on making public office less and less attractive to the average Nigerian \"big man\".\nBeyond the unusually austere salary package for new members of his cabinet - in response to the country's worst economic crisis in years - he has given an instruction that should drastically reduce the size of every serving minister's entourage.\nFew Nigerian big men walk alone: Such a typical highly esteemed and self-important person in Africa's most populous country goes around accompanied by a multitude of men.\nThey follow him to weddings and funerals and birthdays and book launches; they stand when he stands, sit when he sits, and depart when he departs. \nIn return, he takes care of their needs.\nNigeria at glance:\nSource: UN\nYou can often tell when a big man is approaching by the number of followers pushing their way through in front of him or those shepherding from behind.\nYou can usually tell when one is in the vicinity, maybe inside a restaurant or a hotel, by the number of men hovering outside, at the front door or the gate or in the lobby, waiting.\nAs soon as their principal reappears, they jump into action, surround him to his car, then shove their way into their own vehicles, which zoom off behind and in front of his.\nSometimes, the big man is travelling out of Nigeria, perhaps to a country where such exuberant displays of clustering may be greeted with raised eyebrows.\nIn that case, the retinue will stop at the airport lobby, watching solemnly as he jets off.\nBut when he returns, they will have regrouped, possibly on the tarmac, ready to resume their duties from exactly where they stopped.\nAdaobi Tricia Nwaubani:\n\"Some government officials employ scores of their relatives, creating for them roles that never existed before\"\nNone of this is particularly new. In many cultural groups across Nigeria, traditional rulers have been known to move around with a retinue that includes praise singers, who do nothing but blow their master's trumpet.\nWhen I invited my friend, Rick, to an event some time ago, he reminded me that, by asking him, I was automatically inviting dozens of other people.\n\"Are you prepared for that?\" he asked.\nA year previously, he had transitioned from the young man my friends and I had known since our teens, to the new traditional ruler of his community following his father's death.\nOld friend or not, his new status meant it would be unbecoming to appear at my event without his throng of followers.\nBut traditional rulers are not the only ones in Nigeria who now feel entitled to escorts.\nMany business men do not walk alone. Neither do many politicians and pastors.\nI once met a popular 419 scammer who would not sit down in public until one of the retinue of dwarfs who accompanied him had first sat on the seat to make sure it was thoroughly rubbed clean.  \nLike many age-old cultures in Nigeria, having large entourages has crept into our democracy. \nGovernment officials, male and female, are known to surround themselves with aides and special assistants, and personal assistants to aides, and personal assistants to special assistants, and special assistants to personal assistants, each of them suckling from the national treasury.\nSome government officials employ scores of their relatives, creating for them roles that never existed before.\nEven if these employees have nothing to do or no office in which to sit, they will at least come in useful for accompanying their boss to public functions, announcing his great importance by swelling his entourage.    \nPresident Buhari aims to curb all this, on the national level, at least.\nMuhammadu Buhari at a glance:\nFull Buhari profile\nIs Buhari a changed man?\nWhile inaugurating his new ministers, the president directed that they take on aides only from among the civil servants already in the government's employ. \nThis stance is hardly surprising, considering the retired general's famously abstemious character.\nEconomic factors facing the new regime, such as a decline in oil price and budgetary pressures, have made it essential to plug the unnecessary expenditure consumed by hangers on.\nSo this new order will definitely lead to fewer ministerial aides who do not work - and merely hover. \nMore from Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani:", "date": "9 December 2015", "href": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-35038026", "tags": "letter aides cutting many buhari assistants new man size nigeria africa men government big"}
