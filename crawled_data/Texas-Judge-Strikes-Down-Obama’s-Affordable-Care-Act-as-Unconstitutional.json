{"title": "Texas Judge Strikes Down Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act as Unconstitutional", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A federal judge in Texas struck down the entire Affordable Care Act on Friday on the grounds that its mandate requiring people to buy health insurance is unconstitutional and the rest of the law cannot stand without it.\nThe ruling was over a lawsuit filed this year by a group of Republican governors and state attorneys general. A group of intervening states led by Democrats promised to appeal the decision, which will most likely not have any immediate effect. But it will almost certainly make its way to the Supreme Court, threatening the survival of the landmark health law and, with it, health coverage for millions of Americans, protections for people with pre-existing conditions and much more.\nIn his ruling, Judge Reed O\u2019Connor of the Federal District Court in Fort Worth said that the individual mandate requiring people to have health insurance \u201ccan no longer be sustained as an exercise of Congress\u2019s tax power.\u201d\nAccordingly, Judge O\u2019Connor, a George W. Bush appointee, said that \u201cthe individual mandate is unconstitutional\u201d and the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid.\nAt issue was whether the health law\u2019s insurance mandate still compelled people to buy coverage after Congress reduced the penalty to zero dollars as part of the tax overhaul that President Trump signed last December.\nWhen the Supreme Court upheld the mandate as constitutional in 2012, it was based on Congress\u2019s taxing power. Congress, the court said, could legally impose a tax penalty on people who do not have health insurance.\nBut in the new case, the 20 plaintiff states, led by Texas, argued that with the penalty zeroed out, the individual mandate had become unconstitutional \u2014 and that the rest of the law could not be severed from it.\nThe Justice Department\u2019s response to the case was highly unusual: though it disagreed with the plaintiffs that the entire law should be struck down, it declined this year to defend not just the individual mandate, but the law\u2019s provisions that protect people with pre-existing conditions. That prompted a coalition of 16 states and the District of Columbia, led by California, to intervene and defend the law.\nOn Friday night, a spokeswoman for Xavier Becerra, the California attorney general, said California and the other defendant states would challenge the ruling with an appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans.\n\u201cToday\u2019s ruling is an assault on 133 million Americans with pre-existing conditions, on the 20 million Americans who rely on the A.C.A.\u2019s consumer protections for health care, on America\u2019s faithful progress toward affordable health care for all Americans,\u201d Mr. Becerra said in a statement. \u201cThe A.C.A. has already survived more than 70 unsuccessful repeal attempts and withstood scrutiny in the Supreme Court.\u201d\nAttorney General Ken Paxton of Texas, who initiated the lawsuit, applauded the decision, saying in a statement, \u201cToday\u2019s ruling enjoining Obamacare halts an unconstitutional exertion of federal power over the American health care system.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cOur lawsuit seeks to effectively repeal Obamacare, which will give President Trump and Congress the opportunity to replace the failed social experiment with a plan that ensures Texans and all Americans will again have greater choice about what health coverage they need and who will be their doctor.\u201d\nMr. Trump, who has consistently sought the law\u2019s repeal and has weakened it through regulatory changes, posted a response to the ruling on Twitter late Friday night: \u201cAs I predicted all along, Obamacare has been struck down as an UNCONSTITUTIONAL disaster! Now Congress must pass a STRONG law that provides GREAT healthcare and protects pre-existing conditions.\u201d\nThe White House, in a separate statement late Friday, said: \u201cWe expect this ruling will be appealed to the Supreme Court. Pending the appeal process, the law remains in place.\u201d\nIf Judge O\u2019Connor\u2019s decision ultimately stands, about 17 million Americans will lose their health insurance, according to the Urban Institute, a left-leaning think tank. That includes millions who gained coverage through the law\u2019s expansion of Medicaid, and millions more who receive subsidized private insurance through the law\u2019s online marketplaces.\nInsurers will also no longer have to cover young adults up to age 26 under their parents\u2019 plans; annual and lifetime limits on coverage will again be permitted; and there will be no cap on out-of-pocket costs.\nAlso gone will be the law\u2019s popular protections for people with pre-existing conditions, which became a major talking point in the November midterm elections, as Democratic candidates constantly reminded voters that congressional Republicans had tried to repeal the law last year.\nMany Democrats successfully centered their midterm campaigns on protecting the Affordable Care Act\u2019s insurance mandates for pre-existing conditions.\nSenator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, one of the few Democratic senators to save his seat in a heavily Trump-friendly state, excoriated his opponent, West Virginia\u2019s attorney general, Patrick Morrisey, for joining the lawsuit decided in favor of the Republicans on Friday.\nDemocrats in Wisconsin campaigned on a pledge to withdraw the state from the suit, and after they won, that state\u2019s Republican Legislature passed legislation blocking the newly elected Democrats from withdrawing. That legislation was signed into law on Friday by Gov. Scott Walker, who lost his bid for re-election in November.\nBut most Republican candidates insisted during the campaign that they did not want to withdraw protections for pre-existing conditions, and most were silent after Friday\u2019s ruling.\nWithout those protections, insurers could return to denying coverage to such people or to charging them more. They could also return to charging people more based on their age, gender or profession.\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan research organization, estimates that 52 million adults from 18 to 64, or 27 percent of that population, would be rejected for coverage under the practices that were in effect in most states before the Affordable Care Act.\n\u201cIf this Texas decision on the ACA is upheld, it would throw the individual insurance market and the whole health care system into complete chaos,\u201d Larry Levitt, a senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, wrote on Twitter. \u201cBut, the case still has a long legal road to travel before that\u2019s an immediate threat.\u201d\nDemocrats immediately attacked the ruling as absurd. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California said that when the party took control of the House next month, with her as speaker, it would \u201cmove swiftly to formally intervene in the appeals process to uphold the lifesaving protections for people with pre-existing conditions and reject Republicans\u2019 effort to destroy the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\nIn his ruling, Judge O\u2019Connor agreed with the plaintiffs that the individual mandate could not be severed from the rest of the Affordable Care Act because it was \u201cthe keystone\u201d of the law, essential to its regulation of the health insurance market.\n\u201cThe individual mandate is inseverable from the entire A.C.A.,\u201d he declared.\nThe judge said he would not \u201cparse the A.C.A.\u2019s provisions one by one,\u201d but had to invalidate the whole law, including the expansion of Medicaid and the requirement for employers to offer coverage to workers. \u201cThe Medicaid-expansion provisions were designed to serve and assist fulfillment of the individual mandate,\u201d he wrote.\nAt oral arguments before Judge O\u2019Connor in September, California and the other intervening states had argued that the mandate could not be unconstitutional if it was not forcing people to pay penalties anymore. But even if Judge O\u2019Connor threw it out, they said, the rest of the law could legally be severed from it and survive.\nThe ruling came a day before the end of the fifth open enrollment season for Affordable Care Act coverage in most states, one in which sign-ups for \u201cObamacare,\u201d as the coverage sold through the law\u2019s marketplaces is known, have declined so far by about 12 percent compared with last year.", "date": "Dec. 14, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/14/health/obamacare-unconstitutional-texas-judge.html", "tags": "unconstitutional mandate coverage judge \u201d ruling insurance act obama strikes affordable law care texas health"}
