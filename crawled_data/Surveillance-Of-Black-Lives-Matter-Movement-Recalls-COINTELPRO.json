{"title": "Surveillance Of Black Lives Matter Movement Recalls COINTELPRO", "content": "WASHINGTON -- On March 8, 1971, most Americans were fixated on their TV sets as Joe Frazier was about to dance with his nemesis\u00a0Muhammad Ali in the \u201cFight of the Century.\u201d In the 15th round of the match at Madison Square Garden, Frazier landed a left hook that sent Ali crashing to the mat.\u00a0\nThe winner was determined by unanimous decision: Frazier maintained his undefeated status and Ali took the first loss of his professional career.\u00a0The Greatest -- an outspoken anti-war, pro-black activist -- had fallen. But in the shadow of his defeat came the demise of a U.S. intelligence program that had sought to undermine the very causes Ali championed.\nDuring the event, anticipating a near-universal fixation on the boxing match, a group of activists broke into an FBI field office in Pennsylvania and made off with hundreds of the agency\u2019s files. They suspected that FBI agents were infiltrating the anti-Vietnam War movement taking place stateside. The documents, which revealed the existence of COINTELPRO, the FBI\u2019s counterintelligence program, confirmed their suspicions. They detailed widespread surveillance of law-abiding Americans and attempts to disrupt the work of political organizations and civil rights activists.\nCOINTELPRO, founded in 1956 under FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, didn\u2019t distinguish between political and criminal activity and sought only to neutralize dissent.\u00a0\ufeffOne of the initiative\u2019s priorities was to \u201cexpose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, or otherwise neutralize the activities of the Black nationalists,\u201d according to FBI documents. Most of the groups it monitored, outside of white supremacist groups, were seeking racial, gender and class justice.\u00a0\nAs part of the program, Hoover placed federal agents in most black student groups, \u201cwithout regard for whether there had been disturbances on such campuses.\u201d\u00a0Files from the program also gave the impression that the bureau \u201cthought of black Americans as falling into two categories -- black people who should be spied on by the F.B.I. and black people who should spy on other black people for the F.B.I.,\u201d wrote Betty Medsger in \"The Burglary,\" a book about the FBI break-in. \ufeff\nWhile the program was eventually shut down, recent revelations of the Department of Homeland Security's ongoing monitoring of black activists show some disturbing parallels.\u00a0Documents obtained by VICE through a Freedom of Information Act request describe the government's watchful eye:\nThe Department of Homeland Security has been monitoring the Black Lives Matter movement since the Ferguson protests last August, according to The Intercept. A\u00a0peaceful Washington, D.C., protest in support of Freddie Gray was monitored along with cultural festivities like D.C.\u2019s Annual Funk Parade and prayer vigils in predominately black neighborhoods, according to emails The Intercept obtained through FOIA requests. Hashtags pertaining to the movement were followed as well, even though there was no indication of violence:\u00a0\nThe bureau has also been tracking the movement of people who travel across the country protesting police violence, FBI deputy director Mark Giuliano said during a press conference\u00a0in May.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Intercept\u00a0recently showed that the Metropolitan Transit Authority, the Metro-North Railroad and at times the NYPD worked together to monitor Black Lives Matter protests in New York City between December 2014 and February 2015. Activists' movements were tracked and individual photos of certain activists were kept on file, reports from the MTA revealed.\u00a0\nIt's no coincidence these tactics sound familiar. Modern-day surveillance has been influenced by COINTELPRO\u00a0\ufefftactics\ufeff, said\u00a0Angela Allen-Bell, assistant professor of legal writing and analysis at Southern University Law Center. While the government's goal is, understandably, to prevent acts of domestic terrorism, the\u00a0lack of a uniform definition of terrorism makes the process concerning, Allen-Bell told The Huffington Post.\n\"It was such a fluid term then and it remains that way now. So it allows a person to cast a very broad net,\" she said. \"That allows a great amount of latitude.\"\n\ufeffNone of the released documents identify any individual within the Black Lives Matter movement as a domestic terror threat. But\u00a0it is telling that such detailed monitoring is taking place even though the movement has given no indication of a willingness to kill or harm to make a political statement -- as a terrorist likely would.\nWhen most people think of the FBI\u2019s COINTELPRO efforts, the letter suggesting suicide\u00a0sent to Martin Luther King or the assassination of Fred Hampton come to mind. \ufeffThe program's influence on the type of person that constitutes a threat, however, doesn\u2019t register as strongly.\u00a0\ufeffAllen-Bell believes it should.\n\"Hoover was irrational and he was a racist,\" she said. \"He also hated dissenters. He fashioned policy based on this as opposed to [basing it] on legitimate law enforcement considerations.\"\n\u201cSome of what caused suspicion during COINTELPRO is causing the same suspicion today,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd what makes it suspicious? Because people have decided to do what the First Amendment actually says they can do? To me, it seems like an act of intimidation. It\u2019s a subtle way of saying 'we\u2019re watching you.'\u201d\nSome Black Lives Matter activists aren\u2019t letting the surveillance deter them.\u00a0Taurean Brown, a community organizer in Durham, North Carolina, had his first encounter with police surveillance about two years ago, he told Alternet. He said monitoring doesn\u2019t scare him -- because there\u2019s nothing he can do to be \u201ctruly safe.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t fear death. I\u2019m not looking forward to it. I\u2019m not encouraging it, but I don\u2019t fear it. The only thing I do fear is that my personal involvements will affect my loved ones. So, I have to worry about those kinds of things,\u201d said Brown. \u201cThat\u2019s why I never really talk about my personal life. People don\u2019t know my relationship status, where I truly live, how many brothers I have, these things. I try not to leak any of that information.\u201d\nOne prominent civil rights activist who's been monitored is DeRay Mckesson. According to VICE, Homeland Security has been monitoring Mckesson\u2019s social media accounts and referring to him as a \u201cprofessional protester\u201d who is \u201cknown to law enforcement\u201d since Mckesson tweeted details about a planned protest during the Baltimore uprising that ripped through the city following Freddie Gray\u2019s death in April. \u00a0\n\u201cSocial media monitors have reported that a professional demonstrator/protester known to law enforcement (Deray Mckesson) has post on his social media account that there is going to be a 3:00 pm rally at the FOP#3 lodge located @ 3920 Baltimore Ave, Baltimore, MD 21211 \u2026 This is early raw unevaluated and uncorroborated reporting at this time,\u201d said one email obtained by VICE.\nBut DHS documents obtained by Mother Jones\u00a0contradict that, claiming the Social Media Monitoring and Situational Awareness program of the DHS' National Operating Center doesn\u2019t watch personal user accounts and instead focuses on hashtags and other keywords.\u00a0\n\u201cThere\u2019s no threat to the government when you see somebody who has charisma that can organize people,\u201d Allen-Bell said of Mckesson. \u201cThat alone should not garner the attention of the government.\u201d\nAnyone familiar with the history of COINTELPRO might find it troubling to see law enforcement today keeping tabs on an activist simply because they have a voice that resonates. Back then, surveillance was motivated by fear of the \u201crise of a [black] messiah,\u201d who could unite black political groups and, supposedly, \u201cbe the first step toward a real \u2018Mau Mau\u2019 in America, the beginning of a true black revolution.\u201d\u00a0Any divergence from the status quo was suspect. \u201cIn unity there is strength; a truism that is no less valid for all its triteness,\u201d wrote Hoover in his\u00a0outline\u00a0of the program\u2019s goals.\u00a0\nThe specific interest in Mckesson, a former teacher who has largely eschewed an official leadership role in the Black Lives Matter movement, suggests the government is still guided by the belief that black power and influence are intrinsically dangerous, Allen-Bell said.\n\u201cThat we want to watch anybody who reaches the point that they can galvanize people, that is a concern here. It\u2019s not that he\u2019s a threat; it is that [the idea of a]\u00a0black messiah still is a fear to our government. That has never changed,\u201d she said. Mckesson\u2019s \"offense is his blackness. His offense is his ideology.\u201d\nAllen-Bell also said it was highly unlikely that white preachers with similar, if not larger followings, would be considered potential threats to national security.\n\u201cWhy should [Mckesson] raise a concern if he is exposing a viewpoint that he feels is going to generate progress, ultimately, in this country? There\u2019s no violence attached to this. There\u2019s no sinister plot \u2026 None of that has emerged.\u201d\nHistorical context is important here. DHS\u2019 monitoring of social media and the FBI\u2019s and NYPD\u2019s monitoring of activists\u00a0are moral and legal gray areas, whereas COINTELPRO clearly operated outside the law with its infiltration and intimidation of black political and civil rights groups. But the older program's lasting influence on who\u00a0the government sees as a threat -- and why -- shouldn't go unnoticed.\nExercising free speech can only be a threat to national security if what\u2019s being said is hitting a political nerve -- just like in the '60s and '70s. And the issue of racial equality is timeless. It always has, and always will, hit a nerve.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been led to believe that the last chapter was written in the 1970s when COINTELPRO ended and we\u2019re not making the connection that these are the same practices,\" Allen-Bell said. \"This is the same ideology; it's just a different name.\"\n\"If you read COINTELPRO papers, this is the same exact behavior that we defined as a security threat back in the '60s and '70s,\u201d she added.", "date": "\n08/19/2015", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/surveillance-black-lives-matter-cointelpro_n_55d49dc6e4b055a6dab24008", "tags": "movement \u201c cointelpro matter monitoring recalls -- lives black fbi program surveillance"}
