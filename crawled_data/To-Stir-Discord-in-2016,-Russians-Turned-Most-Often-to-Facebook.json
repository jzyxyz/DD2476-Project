{"title": "To Stir Discord in 2016, Russians Turned Most Often to Facebook", "content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In 2014, Russians working for a shadowy firm called the Internet Research Agency started gathering American followers in online groups focused on issues like religion and immigration. Around mid-2015, the Russians began buying digital ads to spread their messages. A year later, they tapped their followers to help organize political rallies across the United States.\nTheir digital instrument of choice for all of these actions? Facebook and its photo-sharing site Instagram.\nThe social network, more than any other technology tool, was singled out on Friday by the Justice Department when prosecutors charged 13 Russians and three companies for executing a scheme to subvert the 2016 election and support Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. In a 37-page indictment, officials detailed how the Russians repeatedly turned to Facebook and Instagram, often using stolen identities to pose as Americans, to sow discord among the electorate by creating Facebook groups, distributing divisive ads and posting inflammatory images.\nWhile the indictment does not accuse Facebook of any wrongdoing, it provided the first comprehensive account from the authorities of how critical the company\u2019s platforms had been to the Russian campaign to disrupt the 2016 election. Facebook and Instagram were mentioned 41 times, while other technology that the Russians used was featured far less. Twitter was referred to nine times, YouTube once and the electronic payments company PayPal 11 times.\nIt is unprecedented for an American technology company to be so central to what the authorities say was a foreign scheme to commit election fraud in the United States. The indictment further batters Facebook\u2019s image after it has spent months grappling with questions about how it was misused and why it did not act earlier to prevent that activity.\nJonathan Albright, research director at Columbia University\u2019s Tow Center for Digital Journalism, said the indictment laid bare how effectively Facebook could be turned against the country.\n\u201cFacebook built incredibly effective tools which let Russia profile citizens here in the U.S. and figure out how to manipulate us,\u201d Mr. Albright said. \u201cFacebook, essentially, gave them everything they needed.\u201d He added that many of the tools that the Russians used, including those that allow ads to be targeted and that show how widespread an ad becomes, still pervade Facebook.\nFacebook, with more than two billion members on the social network alone, has long struggled with what its sites show and the kind of illicit activity it may enable, from selling unlicensed guns to broadcasting live killings. The company\u2019s business depends on people being highly engaged with what is posted on its sites, which in turn helps make it a marquee destination for advertisers.\nWhen suggestions first arose after the 2016 election that Facebook may have influenced the outcome, Mark Zuckerberg, the company\u2019s chief executive, dismissed the concerns. But by last September, Facebook had disclosed  that the Internet Research Agency had bought divisive ads on hot-button issues through the company. It later said 150 million Americans had seen the Russian propaganda on the social network and Instagram.\nThe resulting firestorm has damaged Facebook\u2019s reputation. Company officials, along with executives from Google and YouTube, were grilled by lawmakers last fall. Facebook has since hired thousands of people to help monitor content and has worked with Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel leading the investigation into Russian election interference. It has also changed its advertising policy so that any ad that mentions a candidate\u2019s name goes through a more stringent vetting process. Mr. Zuckerberg has vowed to not let Facebook be abused by bad actors.\nYet Facebook\u2019s multiple mentions in Friday\u2019s indictment renew questions of why the world\u2019s biggest social media company didn\u2019t catch the Russian activity earlier or do more to stop it. How effective the company\u2019s new efforts to reduce foreign manipulation have been is also unclear.\nRob Goldman, Facebook\u2019s vice president of advertising, waded into the discussion on Friday with a series of tweets that argued that Russia\u2019s goal was to sow chaos among the electorate rather than to force a certain outcome in the election. On Saturday, President Trump cited those tweets as evidence that Russia\u2019s disinformation campaign was not aimed at handing him a victory.\nIn Silicon Valley, where Facebook has its headquarters, some critics pilloried the company after the indictment became public.\n\u201cMueller\u2019s indictment underscores the central role of Facebook and other platforms in the Russian interference in 2016,\u201d said Roger McNamee, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist who had invested early in Facebook. \u201cIn its heyday, television brought the country together, giving viewers a shared set of facts and experiences. Facebook does just the opposite, enabling every user to have a unique set of facts, driving the country apart for profit.\u201d\nJoel Kaplan, Facebook\u2019s vice president of global policy, said in a statement that the company was grateful the government was taking action \u201cagainst those who abused our service and exploited the openness of our democratic process.\u201d\nHe added that Facebook was working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation ahead of this year\u2019s midterm elections to ensure that a similar manipulation campaign would not take place. \u201cWe know we have more to do to prevent against future attacks,\u201d he said.\nFacebook has previously questioned whether law enforcement should be more involved in helping to stop the threat from nation state actors. Facebook said it worked closely with the special counsel\u2019s investigation.\nYouTube did not respond to a request for comment, while Twitter declined to comment. PayPal said in a statement that it has worked closely with law enforcement and \u201cis intensely focused on combating and preventing the illicit use of our services.\u201d\nAccording to the indictment, the Internet Research Agency, created in 2014 in St. Petersburg and employing about 80 people, was given the job of interfering with elections and political processes.\nThe group began using American social media to achieve those aims in 2014, when it started making Facebook pages dedicated to social issues like race and religion. Over the next two years, the indictment said, the Russians stole the identities of real Americans to create fake personas and fake accounts on social media. The group then used those to populate and promote Facebook pages like United Muslims of America, Blacktivist and Secured Borders.\nBy 2016, the indictment said, the size of some of these Russian-controlled Facebook groups had ballooned to hundreds of thousands of followers.\nThe Russians then used these groups to push various messages, including telling Americans not to vote in the 2016 election for either Mr. Trump or his opponent, Hillary Clinton. In October 2016, according to the indictment, one Russian-controlled Instagram account called Woke Blacks posted a message saying: \u201cHatred for Trump is misleading the people and forcing Blacks to vote Killary. We cannot resort to the lesser of two devils. Then we\u2019d surely be better off without voting AT ALL.\u201d\nAround 2015, according to the indictment, the Russians also started purchasing ads on Facebook and other social media sites like Twitter, targeting specific communities within the United States. The group used stolen PayPal accounts to pay for the ads and to promote posts, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on the outreach.\nIn one ad, published to promote a Facebook event called \u201cDown with Hillary,\u201d an image of Mrs. Clinton was shown with a black \u201cX\u201d painted across her face. The text read, \u201cHillary Clinton is the co-author of Obama\u2019s anti-police and anti-Constitutional propaganda.\u201d\nBy mid-2016, according to the indictment, the Russians were using their fake Facebook personas to organize political rallies in the United States. That June, for example, posing as the United Muslims of America on Facebook, they promoted a rally called \u201cSupport Hillary. Save American Muslims.\u201d For an August 2016 event organized through Facebook, the Russians also paid for a cage to be built that was large enough to hold an actress depicting Mrs. Clinton in a prison uniform.\nAt every step, the Russians used Facebook\u2019s own tools to make sure their propaganda was as effective as possible. Those tools allowed them to get real-time results on which types of ad campaigns were reaching their target audience or which posts were getting the most engagement with viewers.\nResearchers said that those tools are still widely available and that while the company has worked to remove fake accounts and stem the flow of disinformation, it has refused to let outside researchers examine the data on how Russian actors used the platform so effectively.\n\u201cThey\u2019re taking steps to fix this, but there\u2019s no easy solution,\u201d Anton Vuljaj, a Republican media strategist who has advised campaigns and media groups, said of Facebook and other social media companies. \u201cThis also shows that the public needs to be more vigilant about what is real and what is not online.\u201d", "date": "Feb. 17, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/17/technology/indictment-russian-tech-facebook.html", "tags": "company stir russians election turned used often indictment discord \u201d social facebook"}
