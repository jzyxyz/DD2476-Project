{"title": "Damage Control at Facebook: 6 Takeaways From The Times\u2019s Investigation ", "content": "For more than a year, Facebook has endured cascading crises \u2014 over Russian misinformation, data privacy and abusive content \u2014 that transformed the Silicon Valley icon into an embattled giant accused of corporate overreach and negligence.\nAn investigation by The New York Times revealed how Facebook fought back against its critics: with delays, denials and a full-bore campaign in Washington. Here are six takeaways.\nIn fall 2016, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, was publicly declaring it a \u201ccrazy idea\u201d that his company had played a role in deciding the election. But security experts at the company already knew otherwise. \nThey found signs as early as spring 2016 that Russian hackers were poking around the Facebook accounts of people linked to American presidential campaigns. Months later, they saw Russian-controlled accounts sharing information from hacked Democratic emails with reporters. Facebook accumulated evidence of Russian activity for over a year before executives opted to share what they knew with the public \u2014 and even their own board of directors.\nIn 2015, when the presidential candidate Donald J. Trump called for a ban of Muslim immigrants, Facebook employees and outside critics called on the company to punish Mr. Trump. Mr. Zuckerberg considered it \u2014 asking subordinates whether Mr. Trump had violated the company\u2019s rules and whether his account should be suspended or the post removed.\nBut while Mr. Zuckerberg was personally offended, he deferred to subordinates who warned that penalizing Mr. Trump would set off a damaging backlash among Republicans.\nMr. Trump\u2019s post remained up.\nAs criticism grew over Facebook\u2019s belated admissions of Russian influence, the company launched a lobbying campaign \u2014 overseen by Sheryl Sandberg, the company\u2019s chief operating officer \u2014 to combat critics and shift anger toward rival tech firms. \nFacebook hired Senator Mark Warner\u2019s former chief of staff to lobby him; Ms. Sandberg personally called Senator Amy Klobuchar to complain about her criticism. The company also deployed a public relations firm to push negative stories about its political critics and cast blame on companies like Google.\nThose efforts included depicting the billionaire liberal donor George Soros as the force behind a broad anti-Facebook movement, and publishing stories praising Facebook and criticizing Google and Apple on a conservative news site.\nFacebook faced worldwide outrage in March after The Times, The Observer of London and The Guardian published a joint investigation into how user data had been appropriated by Cambridge Analytica to profile American voters. But inside Facebook, executives thought they could contain the damage. The company installed a new chief of American lobbying to help quell the bipartisan anger in Congress, and it quietly shelved an internal communications campaign, called \u201cWe Get It,\u201d meant to assure employees that the company was committed to getting back on track in 2018.\nSensing Facebook\u2019s vulnerability, some rival tech firms in Silicon Valley sought to use the outcry to promote their own brands. After Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, quipped in an interview that his company did not traffic in personal data, Mr. Zuckerberg ordered his management team to use only Android phones. After all, he reasoned, the operating system had far more users than Apple\u2019s.\nWashington\u2019s senior Democrat, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, raised more money from Facebook employees than any other member of Congress during the 2016 election cycle \u2014 and he was there when the company needed him. \nThis past summer, as Facebook\u2019s troubles mounted, Mr. Schumer confronted Mr. Warner, who by then had emerged as Facebook\u2019s most insistent inquisitor in Congress. Back off, Mr. Schumer told Mr. Warner, and look for ways to work with Facebook, not vilify it. Lobbyists for Facebook \u2014 which also employs Mr. Schumer\u2019s daughter \u2014 were kept abreast of Mr. Schumer\u2019s efforts.", "date": "Nov. 14, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/technology/facebook-crisis-mark-zuckerberg-sheryl-sandberg.html", "tags": "company schumer control investigation russian chief times facebook takeaways critics \u2014 damage zuckerberg"}
