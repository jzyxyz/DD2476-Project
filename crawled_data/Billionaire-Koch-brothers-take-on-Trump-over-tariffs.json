{"title": "Billionaire Koch brothers take on Trump over tariffs", "content": "Powerful US billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch are funding a multi-million dollar campaign against President Donald Trump's trade tariffs.\nThree political groups backed by the brothers say they will use advertising, lobbying and grassroots campaigns to push the benefits of free trade. \nThe duo run Koch Industries, one of the world's largest privately owned firms.\nThe move comes just days after Mr Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from the EU, Canada and Mexico.\nOn Tuesday, the company was told that David Koch, 78, was stepping down because of his deteriorating health.\nIn a letter, Charles Koch, 82, told employees he was \"deeply saddened\" about his brother's departure, adding that \"David has always been a fighter and is dealing with this challenge in the same way\". \nThe three Koch-backed groups launching the campaign against Mr Trump's tariffs: Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, Americans for Prosperity and the LIBRE Initiative, are urging the president to lift the recent tariffs on aluminium and steel imports as well as the proposed tariffs on other imports from China.\nAmericans for Prosperity president Tim Phillips said the tariffs would \"hamstring our full economic potential\". \n\"There are better ways to negotiate trade deals than by punishing American consumers and businesses with higher costs,\" he added. \nThe campaign indicates the level of concern among business groups, typically Republican supporters, about the impact of the tariffs. \nLeaders from the EU, Canada and Mexico have criticised the move and threatened retaliation, sparking fears of a trade war.\nOn Tuesday, Mexico imposed a wide range of new tariffs on US goods, including steel, pork, and bourbon.\nDonald Trump has said the steel tariffs will protect US steelmakers, which he says are vital to national security. \nAnalysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC Washington\nThe Koch network of political organisations has been a reliable cash machine for Republicans for more than a decade. When Donald Trump became the party's nominee, the spigot to conservative candidates continued to flow - although the primary focus of the conservative brothers were congressional candidates and not the top of the ticket.\nSince Mr Trump's surprise victory, Charles and David Koch have sought common ground with the president, particularly on tax reform, but they continue to be far from ideological soul mates. Now, as the president bangs the drums of a trade war, the relations between the libertarian-leaning billionaires and the populist-nationalist president are becoming increasingly frayed.\nIt's not full political warfare yet, however. The advertising and advocacy campaign proposed by the Koch groups tilts in the direction of \"friendly advice\" for the president, not hostile criticism. When paired with congressional efforts to curtail the president's ability to enact new tariffs, however, and the stakes increase.\nThe Republican party has long been a welcoming home to free trade advocates, who point to the economic benefits of globalism and international competition. Mr Trump is trying to change that - but he's picking a fight with some very deep-pocketed adversaries.\nCharles and David Koch's company - the second largest privately owned business in the US - has interests ranging from pipelines to paper towels.\nAccording to Forbes Magazine, each of the men are worth about $60bn (\u00a345bn), and are tied for eighth richest man in the US.\nAccording to the Koch Industries website, they have more than 120,000 employees between all their businesses and subsidiaries. \nThey have previously put money into groups denying climate change and attacking unions and workers' rights.\nBut they have also pushed for criminal justice reform and made large donations to the American Civil Liberties Union.\nLast November, the brothers helped fund Meredith Corporation's deal to buy US magazine publisher Time Inc.\nBut to many Americans, they are known more for their political activism than their corporate brands.\nThe brothers are political mega-donors who have spent millions of dollars on supporting conservative policies, particularly causes that seek to roll back regulations.\nIn 1980, David Koch ran as a vice-presidential candidate of the Libertarian Party.", "date": "5 June 2018", "href": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44366737", "tags": "groups us take billionaire david political trump koch trade brothers tariffs"}
