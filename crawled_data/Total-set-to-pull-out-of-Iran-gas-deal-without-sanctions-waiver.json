Calling it \"decaying and rotten\", he said the deal was \"an embarrassment\" to him \"as a citizen\". \nGoing against advice from European allies, he said he would reimpose economic sanctions that were waived when the deal was signed in 2015.\nWhile European governments continued to support the deal with Iran, firms which operate internationally risk falling foul of the reinstated US embargo. \nTotal's announcement comes after Denmark's Maersk, which operates oil tankers globally, said it would fulfil commitments in Iran already on its books but would not enter into any new contracts. \nAnother Danish oil tanker operator Torm has said it would stop taking new orders in Iran. \nGerman insurer Allianz  said its business in Iran was \"totally minimal\" but while they were waiting for guidance from the EU and the German government they would be winding down any business there.\nTotal said it had spent less than $47m on the Iran project so far and that pulling out would not affect the company's production growth targets. \nIran's oil minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Wednesday, that Tehran would overcome pressures resulting from the United States' withdrawal from the nuclear deal.\n\"The current situation will pass and Iran will emerge as a winner,\" the oil ministry's news agency SHANA quoted Zanganeh as saying.", "date": "16 May 2018", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-44147814", "tags": "iran set sanctions project us without french gas waiver oil pull total deal"}
