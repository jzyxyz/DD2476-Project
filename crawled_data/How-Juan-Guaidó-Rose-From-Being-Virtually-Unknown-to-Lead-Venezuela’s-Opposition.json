{"title": "How Juan Guaid\u00f3 Rose From Being Virtually Unknown to Lead Venezuela\u2019s Opposition", "content": "CARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 A group of soldiers turned against the government and declared allegiance to the opposition. Foreign officials say the government could soon run out of money to meet bare-bones needs. And countries across the region have called the president an illegitimate dictator.\nConditions in Venezuela have deteriorated to a point where the opposition \u2014 gutted by the jailing and exiling of many of its leaders and discredited after several failed efforts to oust President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro \u2014 is seeing an opportunity. Leading them is a virtually unheard-of 35-year-old, Juan Guaid\u00f3.\nHis debut as opposition leader and head of the National Assembly this month has captured the attention of those within the country and outside of it \u2014 mainly for his striking claim that Mr. Maduro is not a legitimate ruler and his willingness to take charge of a transitional government.\n\u201cThe relationship between Venezuela and its state today is one of terror,\u201d Mr. Guaid\u00f3 said in an interview. \u201cWhen this happens, the voices and hopes of the world, their messages, are the encouragement for the daily struggle to resist \u2014 to dream of democracy, and for a better country.\u201d\nWednesday marks the biggest gambit yet for the young leader. He has called on Venezuelans to take to the streets to protest the government. If they heed his call, this would be the first mass mobilization in the country since a bloody crackdown against demonstrators in 2017 left more than 100 people dead in clashes with security forces, according to the United Nations.\n[On Wednesday, Mr. Guaid\u00f3 declared himself president and was recognized by President Trump.

Mar\u00eda Iris Varela Rangel, a top politician in Maduro\u2019s party, wrote on Twitter: \u201cGuaid\u00f3: I have already gotten your jail cell ready with the right uniform, and I hope you name your cabinet quickly to know who will keep you company, you stupid kid.\u201d\nMr. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s challenge to Mr. Maduro comes at a time when his presidency faces mounting challenges of legitimacy. On Jan. 10, the president was sworn in for a second six-year term after a disputed election in May that many countries did not recognize.\nMr. Maduro\u2019s leftist government, which faces sanctions from countries including the United States, is now surrounded by right-wing leaders in Colombia and Brazil. At home, hyperinflation led the president to instate a new currency, which in recent months has been losing value as well. More than three million Venezuelans have fled the country for lack of food and medicine.\nYet if Mr. Maduro has been unpopular, the opposition has been almost equally imperiled during the crisis.\nSince 2017, the National Assembly has been effectively sidelined by a new legislative body created under Mr. Maduro and packed with his supporters. Last year the opposition was so divided over how to confront the president that two parties broke with a boycott to participate in the elections while the rest sat it out.\n\u201cPeople have been frustrated with the opposition, and tired of the same old faces of the politicians of the old establishment that have failed,\u201d said Margarita L\u00f3pez Maya, a retired political scientist in Caracas who taught at the Central University of Venezuela.\nMr. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s rise may mark the opposition\u2019s last, best chance to revive itself, many believe.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a hard worker, he\u2019s humble and he can unite us,\u201d said Lilian Tintori, whose husband, Leopoldo L\u00f3pez, is Venezuela\u2019s most well-known political prisoner and Mr. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s mentor. \u201cBut the risk for him is enormous. They may do the same to Juan as they did to Leopoldo, to put him in jail.\u201d\nMr. Guaid\u00f3 was already briefly detained by masked members of Venezuela\u2019s intelligence service on Jan. 13, two days after declaring his intent to oust Mr. Maduro from power. Accounts differ on the nature of the arrest: The government said he had been detained by rogue officials who were later disciplined, while Mr. Guaid\u00f3 maintained the agents who detained him had seemed sympathetic to the opposition.\nForeign officials, particularly in the United States, who want to see a transitional government in Venezuela, say they saw in Mr. Guaid\u00f3 a fresh-faced leader from humble origins who contrasted with previous opposition leaders, whom Mr. Maduro disparaged as oligarchs and right-wing extremists.\nWhile the United States has not recognized Mr. Guaid\u00f3 as Venezuela\u2019s leader, in recent days senior American officials have denounced Mr. Maduro as a dictator and made clear their support for Mr. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s effort to oust Mr. Maduro and set up a transitional government. Last year, Trump administration officials met in secret with rebellious members of the military to discuss their plans to overthrow Mr. Maduro.\nVice President Mike Pence spoke directly to the Venezuelan people in a video released on YouTube and Twitter on Tuesday, calling Mr. Maduro a \u201cdictator with no legitimate claim to power.\u201d Mr. Pence said he recognized the National Assembly, led by Mr. Guaid\u00f3, as \u201cthe last vestige of democracy in your country,\u201d and stated that, \u201cwe are with you, we stand with you, and we will stay with you until democracy is restored and you reclaim your birthright of libertad.\u201d\nIn response, Mr. Maduro said Tuesday evening that he had ordered a \u201ca total and absolute revision\u201d of relations with the United States. He provided no details on what that might produce, but said decisions would be imminent.\n\u201cWho elects the president of Venezuela? Mike Pence?\u201d Mr. Maduro asked during a live address on state television.\nThe opposition has used the show of support from the United States to urge people to take to the streets on Wednesday.\nAhead of the planned protests, opposition leaders feel buoyed by the large crowds that have already arrived at town hall meetings along with numerous street protests this week. High-profile military defections to their side could mark a point of no return in their bid to oust Mr. Maduro.\nBut a new crackdown on demonstrations and a wave of arrests targeting opposition leaders \u2014 including Mr. Guaid\u00f3 \u2014 are also plausible.\nIt\u2019s also possible Venezuelans, still soured on opposition leaders or simply fearing a government crackdown, do not rise in large numbers to Mr. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s call to protest.\nWith a tall, wiry frame and a penchant for dancing in public and speaking outdoors, Mr. Guaid\u00f3 became politically active as a student leader in Caracas. There he headed protests against then-president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez after Venezuela\u2019s oldest broadcaster was closed, part of broader efforts to muzzle the press.\nAfter college, Mr. Guaid\u00f3, who had studied engineering, was offered a job in the private sector that would have taken him to Mexico, said Juan Carlos Michinel, a friend. He didn\u2019t accept the position.\n\u201cHe wanted to start change here,\u201d said Mr. Michinel. \u201cHe decided to stay here in Venezuela.\u201d\nVoluntad Popular, Mr. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s party, is one of the more hard-line of the opposition\u2019s parties, favoring marches against Mr. Maduro in the streets. Mr. L\u00f3pez, the jailed mentor of Mr. Guaid\u00f3, was sentenced to more than 13 years in prison after leading street protests in 2014 to challenge Mr. Maduro.\nMr. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s ascendance as the face of the opposition could herald a new, more confrontational stance with the government, where the military will be actively courted as allies, said Ms. Tintori.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have arms so we need the military,\u201d she said.\nReached after Mr. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s brief detention by the government last week, Norka del Valle M\u00e1rquez, Mr. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s mother, said her son\u2019s entry into politics at such a critical juncture in the country\u2019s history has left her nervous about his well being and that of his opposition colleagues.\n\u201cDo you ask me if I\u2019m scared? Of course,\u201d she said. But she added that he has worked hard for this moment.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been years of struggle for Juan,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s never wanted to leave this country. He is rooted to his land.\u201d", "date": "Jan. 22, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/22/world/americas/juan-guaido-facts-history-bio.html", "tags": "guaid\u00f3 juan opposition maduro venezuela \u201d lead rose unknown government virtually"}
