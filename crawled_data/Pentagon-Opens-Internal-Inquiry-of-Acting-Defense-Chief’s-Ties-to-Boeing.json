{"title": "Pentagon Opens Internal Inquiry of Acting Defense Chief\u2019s Ties to Boeing", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Defense Department\u2019s inspector general said on Wednesday that it was investigating complaints that the acting defense secretary, Patrick M. Shanahan, had been promoting his former employer, Boeing, and disparaging its military contractor competitors.\nThe investigation will examine complaints filed last week by a watchdog group, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. Dwrena K. Allen, a spokeswoman for the inspector general\u2019s office, said that investigators had informed Mr. Shanahan of the inquiry.\n[Sign up for the weekly At War newsletter to receive stories about duty, conflict and consequence.]\nMr. Shanahan told lawmakers last week that he supported an investigation.\nThe investigation complicates what is already an uphill battle for Mr. Shanahan\u2019s effort to become the next permanent defense secretary. As recently as last week, Defense Department officials believed that President Trump was about to formally nominate Mr. Shanahan for the job left vacant by Jim Mattis, who resigned in December.\nBut as Mr. Shanahan\u2019s troubles mount, the White House does not appear to have a ready and able alternative to him.\nJim Talent, the former senator of Missouri, is one name which White House officials have discussed, according to former and current administration officials. Also under consideration is Robert L. Wilkie, the Veterans Affairs secretary. But Mr. Wilkie is viewed as doing a good job in a troubled department and Mr. Trump is loath to remove him from his post, the officials said.\nThe deadly crash of a Boeing 737 Max 8 jet in Ethiopia, along with growing complaints that his cozy relationship with his former employers at the detriment of other military contractors, puts Mr. Shanahan\u2019s fate in limbo.\nMr. Shanahan served as the Pentagon\u2019s deputy secretary under Mr. Mattis, a job that required Senate confirmation. Before that, he spent 30 years in commercial aviation and business at Boeing. He had hoped to bring his reputation as a corporate problem solver \u2014 including helping introduce the 787 Dreamliner \u2014 to the Defense Department.\nSeveral Defense Department officials predicted this week that it was unclear whether Mr. Shanahan could win Senate confirmation for the Pentagon\u2019s top job, given his longstanding ties with Boeing and the fallout from the crash of the Ethiopian Airlines plane.\nThe transportation secretary, Elaine L. Chao, called on Tuesday for her agency\u2019s internal watchdog to investigate the process by which the Federal Aviation Administration in 2017 approved designs for the 737 Max. Lawmakers in Congress also are pushing for a review, while Canada is looking into its approval of the plane\u2019s American certification.\nThe specific allegations that the Defense Department\u2019s inspector general is examining revolve around complaints, first reported in Politico, that Mr. Shanahan disparaged competitors of Boeing during meetings at the Pentagon with senior national security officials and lawmakers, two United States officials said.\nSenator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts and a member of the Armed Services Committee that would consider Mr. Shanahan\u2019s confirmation if he is nominated, said she alerted the Pentagon\u2019s internal watchdog after hearing that he \u201cmay have advocated on behalf of his former employer, Boeing, while serving as the acting defense secretary.\u201d\n\u201cThe American people should be able to trust that government officials are working for them \u2014 not for big defense contractors,\u201d Ms. Warren, who is running for president, said in a statement.\nWhile Mr. Mattis resigned in protest of Mr. Trump\u2019s policies \u2014 including the surprise announcement that American troops would withdraw from Syria \u2014 Mr. Shanahan has held the line for the president.\nAs the deputy defense secretary, Mr. Shanahan made clear that \u201cwe are not the Department of No,\u201d as he told officials after the administration announced plans to create a new stand-alone Space Force at the Pentagon. It has since been moved to the oversight of the Air Force.\nSince becoming acting defense secretary, Mr. Shanahan has raised the ire of some lawmakers. Last month, Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma and the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said he did not believe Mr. Shanahan shared the \u201chumility\u201d of Mr. Mattis but did not elaborate. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, also clashed with Mr. Shanahan last month over the planned troop withdrawal from Syria.\nLast week, Mr. Shanahan appeared in front of Mr. Inhofe\u2019s committee to sell the Pentagon\u2019s proposed $750 billion budget for the 2020 fiscal year, which is geared toward combating threats from Russia and China and modernizing a military that has long focused on counterinsurgency conflicts.\nInstead, senators accosted him on a range of issues, including Mr. Trump\u2019s move to take billions of dollars from the Defense Department for a border wall, and the Pentagon\u2019s decision to push for weaker standards on chemicals in drinking water.", "date": "March 20, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/20/us/politics/boeing-pentagon.html", "tags": "defense opens pentagon officials inquiry boeing department internal chief secretary ties shanahan acting \u2014"}
