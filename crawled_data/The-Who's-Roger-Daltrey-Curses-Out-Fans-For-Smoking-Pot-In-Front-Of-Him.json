He said in 2015 that while he had previously smoked pot, he otherwise avoided most other drugs and never touched cocaine.\u00a0\n\u201cI would have been dead very young if I\u2019d been doing those drugs,\u201d he told The Mirror. \u201cI was \u2018Dad\u2019 and I had to be. I had to be tough. I was with three addicts.\u201d\nThe Who\u2019s drummer, Keith Moon, died of a drug overdose in 1978 and bass player John Entwistle died in 2002 of a heart attack caused by cocaine use. Guitarist Pete Townshend, who still tours with Daltrey as The Who, has also famously had his battles with substance abuse.\u00a0\n\u201cI used to basically herd them around,\u201d Daltrey told the Mirror. \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but that was my position.\u201d\nLast year, he told Rolling Stone he was the \u201cfucking boring\u201d member of the band because he didn\u2019t partake.\n\u00a0\n(h/t Raw Story)\u00a0", "date": "\n05/15/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/roger-daltrey-curse-pot-fans_n_5cdb88c7e4b061f71b878f24", "tags": "daltrey roger drugs \u201d curses pot night front smoking fans told made"}
