{"title": "Supreme Court Will Review New York City Gun Law", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court said on Tuesday that it would review a New York City gun law that limits residents from transporting their guns outside their homes, its first Second Amendment case in nearly a decade and a test of the court\u2019s approach to gun rights after the arrival of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh in October.\nJustice Kavanaugh, who replaced the more moderate Justice Anthony M. Kennedy and created a reliable five-member conservative majority, has an expansive view of gun rights. His presence most likely means that the Supreme Court will start exploring and perhaps expanding the scope of the Second Amendment.\n\u201cIt could be a landmark case with major implications for gun policy,\u201d said Adam Winkler, the author of \u201cGunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America.\u201d \u201cThe case could articulate broad principles about the Second Amendment, and especially the Second Amendment outside the home.\u201d\nCourt scholars said Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s replacement of Justice Kennedy could lead to an abrupt lurch from the court\u2019s previous decisions.\n\u201cThis is just the first case but not likely the last case where at least four justices open the way to a major ruling that could limit gun safety laws,\u201d said Michael Waldman, the author of \u201cThe Second Amendment: A Biography,\u201d referring to a Supreme Court rule requiring four votes to add cases to its docket.\nThe New York City ordinance challenged in the new case allows residents with so-called premises licenses to take their guns to one of seven shooting ranges within the city limits. But the ordinance forbids them to take their guns anywhere else, including second homes and shooting ranges outside the city, even when they are unloaded and locked in a container separate from ammunition.\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s new majority seems ready to continue a project begun in 2008, when the court, by a 5-to-4 vote, established an individual right to keep guns in the home for self-defense. That decision, District of Columbia v. Heller, was both revolutionary and in its way quite limited. Exactly what the Second Amendment protects has been in dispute ever since.\nJustice Antonin Scalia\u2019s majority opinion in the Heller decision included an important limiting passage that was almost certainly the price of Justice Kennedy\u2019s fifth vote. \u201cNothing in our opinion,\u201d Justice Scalia wrote, \u201cshould be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.\u201d\nSince the Heller decision, lower courts have overwhelmingly upheld state and local gun control laws. The Supreme Court, in turn, has refused to hear appeals from those decisions. Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s arrival changed that.\nLast year, dissenting from the court\u2019s decision not to hear a Second Amendment case, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that the court was abdicating its duty to protect an important constitutional right.\n\u201cAs evidenced by our continued inaction in this area,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthe Second Amendment is a disfavored right in this court.\u201d\n\u201cThe right to keep and bear arms is apparently this court\u2019s constitutional orphan,\u201d Justice Thomas wrote. \u201cAnd the lower courts seem to have gotten the message.\u201d\nThree city residents and the New York State Rifle and Pistol Association sued to challenge the law but lost in Federal District Court in Manhattan and in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. A unanimous three-judge panel of the Second Circuit ruled that the ordinance passed constitutional muster under the Heller decision.\nIn urging the Supreme Court to hear their appeal in the case, New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. City of New York, No. 18-280, the challengers said the restrictions imposed by the New York City ordinance were unique in the nation and made no sense.\n\u201cOnly New York City flatly prohibits its residents from removing their lawfully purchased and duly registered handguns from the city limits, even to transport them (unloaded, and locked up) to second homes at which they are constitutionally entitled to possess them, or to out-of-city shooting ranges or competitions at which they are constitutionally entitled to hone their safe and effective use,\u201d the challengers\u2019 brief said.\n\u201cThat prohibition does not even make sense on its own terms,\u201d the brief said. \u201cIt has the perverse consequences of forcing New Yorkers to leave their handguns behind in their vacant residences whenever they leave the city for an extended period of time.\u201d\nLawyers for the city responded that the law was justified by public safety considerations. Before 2001, their brief said, the city offered a license that allowed owners to take their guns to shooting ranges outside the city.\nThe Police Department, the brief said, \u201cobserved widespread abuses.\u201d Firing ranges in the city must keep detailed records, the brief said, but people with the old licenses who were found with guns outside their homes could claim to be headed to a range outside the city that did not keep such records.\nMayor Bill de Blasio, responding to a reporter\u2019s question about the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to hear the case, said at a news conference on Tuesday that the city would vigorously defend its law.\n\u201cWe, every single day, are working to make this the safest big city in America,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need the laws that we have that protect against guns being on our streets and we will fight to protect ourselves, that\u2019s the bottom line.\u201d\nMr. Waldman said he was surprised the Supreme Court agreed to hear such a minor Second Amendment case when it has ducked some major ones.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a city ordinance, not a state law,\u201d Mr. Waldman said. \u201cThis particular rule is unusual. It may be the only one of its kind in the country.\u201d\n\u201cThe justices,\u201d he said, \u201cmay see this as a way to start addressing gun rights outside the home in a quirky and incremental manner.\u201d\nThe court will hear arguments in the case in its next term, which starts in October, and may not issue a decision until 2020. But Tuesday\u2019s decision to hear the case sent a message about a new era in the court led by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.\n\u201cThe Second Amendment is alive and well in the Roberts court,\u201d Mr. Winkler said.", "date": "Jan. 22, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/22/us/politics/supreme-court-guns-nyc-license.html", "tags": "york court city second amendment gun supreme \u201d justice new case review law"}
