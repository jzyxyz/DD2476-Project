{"title": "Trump Threatens Coverage Of Millions If Democrats Won't Negotiate On ACA Repeal", "content": "President Donald Trump is contemplating a new strategy to get repeal of the Affordable Care Act through Congress: threatening to torpedo insurance for millions of Americans unless Democrats agree to negotiate with him.\nIn an interview with the Wall Street Journal that appeared on Wednesday, Trump made a warning. If Democrats won\u2019t talk repeal, the president said, Republicans might decide to cut off some subsidies now flowing to health insurers offering coverage through Obamacare\u2019s exchanges.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want people to get hurt,\u201d Trump said, sounding a bit like a mobster describing a protection racket. \u201cWhat I think should happen \u2014 and will happen \u2014 is the Democrats will start calling me and negotiating.\u201d\nThose subsidies are a really big deal. Without them, insurers would have to jack up premiums \u2015 by an average of 19 percent for typical policies, according to a Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation study. That increase would be above and beyond any other increases in the works. Many insurers would probably exit the markets altogether.\nThe payments are called cost-sharing reductions, or CSRs. They reimburse insurers for the expense of providing special insurance plans, with lower out-of-pocket costs, to customers with incomes below 250 percent of the poverty line, or $61,500 for a family of four. \nThe health care law calls on the federal government to pay insurers the CSRs but it does not actually appropriate money for that purpose. The Obama administration had disbursed the money anyway, and devised a legal argument to justify the move. House Republicans sued, claiming the spending was unconstitutional, and last year a U.S. district court judge agreed with them.\nThe judge stayed the decision, allowing the Obama administration to file an appeal, and in the interim the federal government has continued to disburse the CSRs. But with the Obama administration gone, it\u2019s up to the Trump administration and its allies to keep the money flowing. \nThe Trump administration could do so, at least temporarily, by pressing ahead with the appeal or simply seeking a delay in the case. Or it could work with Congress on a more permanent solution \u2015 namely, passing legislation that would appropriate the money for a limited time or indefinitely.\nUntil Wednesday, the administration hadn\u2019t said much, except that it would continue funding CSRs as long as it was required to do so by law. Several Republicans in Congress went a bit further, and said they thought the federal government should keep disbursing the funds as long as the law was in place \u2015 although they stopped short of saying exactly how they intended to make that happen.\nIn the Journal interview, Trump for the first time shed light on his own thinking:\nPolitico subsequently quoted a senior official confirming that \u201cPOTUS wants to use [the subsidies] as leverage. When Obamacare fails on its own, the Dems will want to come to the table.\u201d\nThat prediction may be a bit fanciful. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called Trump\u2019s statement \u201cappalling\u201d and accused him of trying to \u201cmanufacture a crisis.\u201d\u00a0\nHer Senate counterpart, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), said, \u201cOur position remains unchanged: drop repeal, stop undermining our health care system, and we will certainly sit down and talk about ways to improve the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\nNor is it clear whether Trump is prepared to carry out his threat. He ended up backing down from the last Obamacare-related ultimatum he made \u2015 a demand, in March, that House Republicans vote on repeal legislation.\nBut\u00a0simply making the threat is sure to unnerve the nation\u2019s insurers, at a time when they are figuring out what premiums to charge for the coverage they sell through the Affordable Care Act\u2019s exchanges \u2015 and, in some cases, whether to withdraw from those exchanges altogether.\nThe law\u2019s private insurance exchanges have been a fragile enterprise from the get-go, with insurers struggling to make money and premiums rising quickly in some states \u2015 in part because many people have found the coverage too expensive to afford, and in part because Republicans at the state and federal level have done their best to undermine the program.\nIn 2014, for example, conservatives attacked the law\u2019s \u201crisk corridors,\u201d a standard feature of public-private insurance programs designed to insulate carriers from huge losses. The conservatives prevailed, which meant the program paid out only a fraction of the money it owed \u2015 saddling insurers with huge losses.\nThe difficulty of making money on Obamacare led some insurers, particularly the big national carriers, to pull back from the market, and today roughly one in five people buying through the exchanges can choose from just one carrier. Critics of the law, like Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), have for years cited stories like these as proof the law was \u201cexploding\u201d and in need of repeal.\nBut the state of the program varies a lot from state to state, and in California, Florida and Maryland, just to name a few, the program is working well \u2015 with multiple insurers and prices that are actually cheap relative to the cost of comparable employer plans. There is also strong evidence that last year\u2019s price hikes \u2015 the ones that Trump kept talking about during his presidential campaign \u2015 were mostly a one-time correction of the premiums insurers initially set too low.\nJust last week, a report from S&P Global Market Intelligence found that nonprofit Blue Cross plans, a staple of the exchanges, were seeing improved margins \u2015 and on track for profitability within a few years.\nBut that report also made a warning that analysts and insurance officials had been making for months: Future success depended on steady management and nurturing. And that\u2019s not what the Affordable Care Act has gotten since January, when the Trump administration took over.\nAt various times, it looked like the Trump administration might be taking its stewardship of the law seriously \u2015 and trying to keep insurance markets stable even as it sought to repeal the law. The Department of Health and Human Services issued new regulations, tweaking enrollment procedures in ways insurers had long recommended, and gave a green light to states trying to use special waivers from the law\u2019s requirements in order to help struggling insurers.\nBut Trump\u2019s very first act as president was to sign an executive order instructing agencies to ease the law\u2019s regulatory burden \u2015 an order that seemed to signal, among other things, that his administration would not aggressively enforce the law\u2019s individual mandate penalty, which encourages healthy people to buy coverage before they get sick. Sure enough, within a few weeks the Internal Revenue Service announced it was canceling plans to tighten up mandate enforcement.\nMore ominously still, the Trump administration in January abruptly canceled some advertising that was supposed to run at the end of open enrollment. The advertising, which the Obama administration had planned, was supposed to nudge people waiting until the last minute to sign up for a plan.\u00a0But without the ads \u2015 and amid all the talk of repeal \u2015 signups in the last two weeks fell well below last year\u2019s levels, even though enrollment had been running slightly ahead of the 2016 pace through January.\nThe possibility that Trump might not implement the law aggressively \u2015 to say nothing of the possibility that the law might be repealed altogether \u2015 has been on the minds of insurers for weeks, as they try to figure out their plans for 2018 and beyond. \nAnd they have made clear that one issue, in particular, would weigh heavily on their minds: the future of those reimbursements for offering plans with low out-of-pocket costs.\n\u201cYou cannot understate how big a deal they are\u201d to insurers,\u00a0Sean Mullin, a senior director at the health care consulting firm Leavitt Partners, told The Huffington Post earlier this week.\nOn Wednesday, just hours before the Journal interview appeared, a group of eight influential trade groups \u2015 including not just America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans and the American Medical Association, but also the U.S. Chamber of Commerce \u2015 wrote a letter to Trump saying\u00a0\u201cThe most critical action to help stabilize the individual market for 2017 and 2018 is to remove uncertainty about continued funding for cost sharing reductions (CSRs).\u201d\nFollowing the publication of Trump\u2019s comments, Kristine Grow, AHIP spokesperson, told HuffPost that\u00a0\u201cWe must remember that when we talk about CSRs, we are talking about a subsidy that 7 million people rely on \u2015\u00a0to get coverage, and to be able to see their doctor.\u201d\nIn the Journal interview, Trump said he thought his threat would bring Democrats to the table because \u201cthey own Obamacare\u201d \u2015 but acknowledged that \u201cthe longer I\u2019m behind this desk and you have Obamacare, the more I would own it.\u201d\nRecent polls suggest that transformation has already taken place. In a new Kaiser Foundation poll that appeared last week, 61 percent said they would blame Trump and the Republicans for problems with the health care law, while just 31 percent said they\u2019d blame Obama and the Democrats.", "date": "\n04/12/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-threatens-coverage_n_58eebb13e4b0bb9638e13674", "tags": "administration care millions wo coverage democrats threatens insurers repeal \u201d trump negotiate \u2015 aca law"}
