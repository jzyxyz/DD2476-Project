{"title": "Special counsel: What is it and what is Robert Mueller doing?", "content": "A special counsel is in place to oversee the investigation looking into alleged Russian interference in the US presidential election, and if Trump campaign figures were complicit.\nRobert Mueller, who headed the FBI for more than a decade, was appointed in May 2017.\nBut what is a special counsel? And what powers does he have?\nThe special counsel was appointed by Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general. He made the decision as \"acting attorney general\" because Attorney General Jeff Sessions had stepped aside from the Russia inquiry.\nMr Rosenstein said that given the \"unique circumstances\", it was in the public interest for a special counsel independent \"from the normal chain of command\", to lead the investigation.\nBy placing authority for the probe into the hands of Mr Mueller, the idea was that it would be able to proceed without any interference, including from the White House.\nMr Rosenstein's order allows Mr Mueller to look into:\nThat last point gives him quite a broad remit, with observers suggesting that he will also determine if the president himself has committed any wrongdoing.\nSo far, his investigation has ventured into work done by former Trump advisers and Russian nationals. Thirty-four people have been charged with wrongdoing. \nThe special counsel has the powers of a US attorney - meaning he can subpoena records and bring criminal charges. And he has done so.\nHe can also prosecute anyone who interferes in his investigation through crimes including perjury, obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence, and intimidation of witnesses.\nThe special counsel can also ask for his jurisdiction to be widened.\nHe is not supervised on a day-to-day basis but the attorney general, or in this case Mr Rosenstein, is able to request an explanation for \"any investigative or prosecutorial step\"  and can decide that any such action does not need to go ahead. \nHe must notify Congress if such a decision is made.\nThe justice department has provided staff that can work for Mr Mueller, and he can also ask for specific people from both inside and outside the department.\nHe is reported to have hired at least 17 federal prosecutors, including experts in money laundering, fraud, foreign bribery and organised crime.\nThe new attorney general is Bill Barr, who replaced Jeff Sessions after the former Alabama senator was fired.\nMr Barr can fire the special counsel for the following reasons: misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest or for other \"good cause\", including violation of department policies.\nNot necessarily. When a special counsel's work ends, a confidential report must be provided to the attorney general.\nHe then has to notify Congress and can decide if the report should be made public. \nWhen pressed during his confirmation hearing about how much he would release to Congress, Mr Barr was non-committal.\nDemocrats on key committees have said they would use subpoena powers if necessary to obtain access to the report.\nThe term \"special prosecutor'\" in the US context harks back to the Watergate scandal, when President Nixon's attorney general appointed Archibald Cox to lead an independent investigation.\nBut there was actually no law defining and regulating such an appointment, which allowed Mr Nixon to later fire Mr Cox. Only later, in 1978, was the Ethics in Government Act passed, which defined the circumstances under which an \"independent counsel\" could be appointed. \nThis role actually had more independence from the attorney general than the current special counsel position. \nBut the legal provision regulating it was allowed to expire in 1999 after the controversy of independent counsel Kenneth Starr's wide-ranging investigation into President Bill Clinton, which started as an inquiry into the Whitewater land deal allegations but ended up providing details of his sexual relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.\nSo the titles \"independent counsel\" or \"special prosecutor\" no longer exist.\nInstead the justice department has regulations allowing an outside \"special counsel\" to be appointed to investigate a person or matter when it might present a conflict of interest for the department or under other \"extraordinary circumstances\".", "date": "21 February 2019", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-39961732", "tags": "appointed independent investigation counsel department robert attorney general special mueller"}
