{"title": "'Game Of Thrones' Showrunners To Direct Next Film In 'Star Wars' Galaxy", "content": "Rest assured, bitter \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d fans. Another opportunity for showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss to disappoint you in a galaxy far, far away awaits.\u00a0\nAfter \u201cThe Rise of the Skywalker\u201d blasts off into theaters this December, the creators of the HBO fantasy juggernaut are set to helm the next entry in the franchise. Walt Disney Company chairman Bob Iger confirmed at the MoffettNathanson Media & Communications summit on Tuesday that Benioff and Weiss\u2019 \u201cStar Wars\u201d film is expected to be released in 2022.\n\u201cWe did a deal with David Benioff and D.B Weiss, who are famous for\u00a0\u2018Game of Thrones,\u2019 and the next movie that we release will be theirs,\u201d Iger said, according to io9. \u201cAnd we\u2019re not saying anything more about that.\u201d\nThough Igor had indicated just last month that there would be a \u201cpause\u201d after \u201cRise of The Skywalker,\u201d the film studio is now charging ahead with a new slate of films. There are reportedly plans for three currently untitled \u201cStar Wars\u201d features, with releases scheduled for December 2022, 2024 and 2026.\u00a0\nDetails about Benioff and Weiss\u2019 film are scarce, but the project will reportedly break with the Skywalker bloodline and focus on a different set of characters. Fans have clamored for new films to be based in the Old Republic, an era set hundreds of years before the current saga, which would very much be within the creators\u2019 wheelhouse.\n\u201c[We thought] it would be smart for us to take a bit of a hiatus while we figure out what\u2019s next. Now, we\u2019re not going to wait until [\u2018The Rise of Skywalker\u2019] is released and start figuring it out, we\u2019re actually hard at work doing that already,\u201d Iger said at the summit. \u201cThe conclusion that we reached was that three years was the proper amount of time to not only take a breather and reset, but to really gear up for the next film\u2019s release.\u201d\nThe company announced in November 2017 that \u201cThe Last Jedi\u201d director Rian Johnson would also be helming his own trilogy, but it was previously unclear which batch of films would debut first.\u00a0\nAnd if a three-year \u201cStar Wars\u201d dry spell is of concern, two television series set in the universe \u2015 Jon Favreau\u2019s \u201cThe Mandalorian\u201d\u00a0and the upcoming Cassian Andor series \u2014 are in the works, with the former debuting on the Disney+\u00a0streaming platform in 2019.\u00a0", "date": "\n05/14/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/game-of-thrones-showrunners-star-wars_n_5cdaeff3e4b0f7ba48abe65f", "tags": "next film set galaxy benioff skywalker weiss wars \u201d direct rise thrones showrunners"}
