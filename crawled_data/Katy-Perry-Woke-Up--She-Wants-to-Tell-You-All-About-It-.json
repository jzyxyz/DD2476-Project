{"title": "Katy Perry Woke Up. She Wants to Tell You All About It.", "content": "A dizzying array of police lights flashed up and down the West Side Highway on a damp Thursday in May. President Trump was visiting the U.S.S. Intrepid, snarling traffic outside the Javits Convention Center, where Katy Perry was performing at a corporate showcase for her new partner, YouTube. The last time she was in the building was election night, when she had been preparing to toast the victory of Mr. Trump\u2019s opponent.\nFor Ms. Perry, who prominently supported Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, that party on Nov. 8 began \u201cwith everybody looking fancy and beautiful and high on their horses,\u201d she recalled in an interview several weeks after her YouTube set. The mood rapidly shifted when word started to spread that Mrs. Clinton was not on her way there \u2014 news that Ms. Perry, 32, described as \u201ctraumatizing.\u201d\n\u201cIt was a revelation, it was a reckoning,\u201d she said of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s loss. She started downing drinks and reached out to the nearest person for physical support: Lady Gaga, also there to celebrate the election of the first female president. There they were, \u201cGaga and I just looking at each other, and being like, [expletive] it, we need to touch each other,\u201d Ms. Perry said. And for a minute, two of the biggest pop stars in the world held hands.\n[Sign up for our music newsletter, Louder.]\nAlliances aren\u2019t easily made in the superstar stratosphere, where elbows are often sharp. And Ms. Perry, who released her fourth major label album, \u201cWitness,\u201d on June 9, stands as one of the biggest successes in the industry, alongside Madonna, Beyonc\u00e9 and Taylor Swift. She has sold 6.5 million albums and nearly 71 million digital songs in the United States, according to Nielsen Music; notched 14 Top 10 Billboard Hot 100 hits; performed at the 2015 Super Bowl halftime show; and landed a gig as a judge on the revamped \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d which is to return in September on ABC.\nBut she said she had an awakening on election night tied to misogyny in her past. And she is undertaking a strenuous effort to prove she isn\u2019t the same frothy Katy Perry as before, making over her look, her music and her vocabulary. For 96 hours, timed to the album\u2019s release, she spread that message of \u201cunity and communication\u201d via filibuster \u2014 a nonstop YouTube live stream called \u201cWitness World Wide,\u201d organized into segments (a therapy session, meditations, a cathartic chat with RuPaul) where the words \u201csafe place\u201d came up a lot and Ms. Perry worked out to her own album.\nThanks to Madonna\u2019s restlessness, female pop stars are expected to reinvent themselves every few years, but there\u2019s no guarantee that listeners will accept the changes. For Ms. Perry, the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher: She believes she is now revealing her true self. The old Katy Perry is gone.\n\u201cEvery day when I think I know something, the universe shows me that I need to learn another lesson,\u201d she told me in a Manhattan shared work space. \u201cSo I stand here today, more so than any other day, saying I know nothing. I literally know nothing.\u201d (Ms. Perry often veers into platitudes, but she is consistent: During the live stream, she wore an \u201cI Know Nothing\u201d T-shirt for yoga, and the phrase is currently her Twitter bio.)\n\u201cI feel very empowered,\u201d she continued, \u201cextremely liberated, liberated from the conditioning of the way I used to think, spiritually liberated, politically liberated, sexually liberated, liberated from things that don\u2019t serve me.\u201d\nShe said she stopped drinking (for now) on Jan. 15, and she has been attending group therapy with her family. Her parents are Pentecostal pastors, and Ms. Perry, who was born Katheryn Hudson, was raised in a strict religious tradition. \u201cI went to that dark place that I had been avoiding, and I dug out the mold,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was not fun, but I did that \u2014 I\u2019m still doing that.\u201d\nChange is also the theme of the throbbing \u201cWitness,\u201d an introspective, less pop-driven album that\u2019s a departure from her last two records, \u201cPrism\u201d (2013) and \u201cTeenage Dream\u201d (2010). It\u2019s her first LP not to feature work from her longtime collaborator Dr. Luke \u2014 \u201cI had to leave the nest,\u201d she said; he declined to comment for this article \u2014 though she continued her partnership with the Swedish hitmaker Max Martin.\nAnd she assumed even greater creative control, helping bring in producers like the indie-pop duo Purity Ring, the composer Dustin O\u2019Halloran (the theme from Amazon\u2019s \u201cTransparent\u201d) and the English musician Jack Garratt to create a palette that\u2019s dreamy and clubby, if not as grabby as her earlier records. Ms. Perry has always been known as a reliable singles artist, but reviews haven\u2019t been friendly. The album\u2019s most successful single, \u201cChained to the Rhythm,\u201d peaked at No. 4.\nMs. Perry told me she didn\u2019t play her new music for Capitol Records, her label, until a few weeks before our interview, which is late in the process. If the label minded, it isn\u2019t saying so. \u201cI like to allow her the freedom to keep pursuing her artistic vision, and obviously we support her fully in all her endeavors,\u201d said Steve Barnett, the chairman and chief executive of the Capitol Music Group, adding that choices about her sound and team were Ms. Perry\u2019s call: \u201cI think she\u2019s earned and deserved that.\u201d\nThe person charged with helping create Ms. Perry\u2019s vision was Lauren Glucksman, 28, who is credited with A&R on the album, stepping into this role for the first time on a full LP. (She formerly worked as an assistant to the singer Ellie Goulding and managed the songwriter Banks.) \u201cWe have a very honest rapport with each other, we have very similar taste, and ultimately I saw my job as trying to translate what\u2019s in her mind and in her heart,\u201d Ms. Glucksman said. Both women were listening to a lot of electronic pop, and the way Ms. Perry explained it, she decided, \u201cI\u2019m going to stop making a playlist and just be the playlist.\u201d\nIn the knotty world of internet superfandom, the harshest takes often come from deep inside an artist\u2019s nucleus of support. Fans were so concerned about Ms. Perry\u2019s shifts on \u201cWitness,\u201d they lasered in on Ms. Glucksman and demanded her ouster from the inner circle. (\u201c#FireLauren,\u201d tweeted one particularly vociferous account.)\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t let people grow,\u201d Ms. Perry said. \u201cThey just want a time capsule. And they want them to be one thing. And we have to start reimagining that.\u201d\n\nMS. PERRY DOESN\u2019T need to live in a house outfitted with 41 \u201cBig Brother\u201d-style cameras to be aware that she is under constant surveillance. She has a well-known strategy for frustrating the paparazzi (wearing the same Adidas track suit when she leaves home to make the photographs less sellable), but that can\u2019t stop the kind of gawking that accompanies daily life when you\u2019re trading punches with another wildly famous blond pop star, or dating a famous actor who enjoys nude paddle-boarding. When she took up a vocal position as a Clinton supporter, she became a target of the alt-right. But as she started revving up for \u201cWitness,\u201d it felt like some on the left were also taking their knives out.\nOver the years, Ms. Perry has absorbed criticism for cultural appropriation, for being too sexy on \u201cSesame Street,\u201d for dating John Mayer. But in the past few months, the somewhat erratic nature of her album rollout (a long string of ideas that didn\u2019t quite land, like serving her head on a platter as part of an \u201cart installation\u201d at the Whitney Museum of American Art) dripped blood in the water. And the sharks \u2014 not the adorably inept Left Shark at the Super Bowl \u2014 started circling.\nReacting to a steady stream of criticism (TMZ\u2019s Met Ball headline: \u201cKaty Perry Rocks Ugly Outfit by Jew-Hating Designer\u201d) is a \u201cmaddening game,\u201d she said. Referring to what she called \u201cthis strange race to be the most woke,\u201d she added, \u201cThey want you to stand for something, but once you do, and if you don\u2019t do it perfectly, they\u2019re ready to take you right down.\u201d\nIt didn\u2019t take long for the outrage machine to ramp up in real time. Three days before our interview, Ms. Perry greeted me in her dressing room at \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d where she was performing on the season finale, and interrogated me with questions while maintaining some of the most penetrating eye contact I\u2019ve experienced outside of an ophthalmologist\u2019s chair, her already wide eyes blazing under heavy swooshes of silver glitter.\nOn the show, she strutted to her latest single, \u201cSwish Swish,\u201d with a group of drag queens and posed on a banquet table to \u201cBon App\u00e9tit\u201d with the Atlanta rap trio Migos. Then she spent an hour getting reglammed for the after-party; snuggled her micro teacup poodle, Nugget; and marched through an underground parking garage, pausing at a vending machine to buy a bag of Cool Ranch Doritos. At the party, she was easy to spot on the dance floor, throwing down beside Leslie Jones to Jessie J\u2019s \u201cBang Bang\u201d and Bruno Mars\u2019s \u201cThat\u2019s What I Like\u201d \u2014 you just had to look for all the cellphones in the air, capturing her every move.\n\u201cSO. FUN,\u201d Ms. Perry tweeted about the show to her nearly 100 million followers, adding a shout-out \u201cto my LGBTQ family, all the Queens & @Migos for showing unity & respect.\u201d But the internet had already cited her for several violations, including appropriating gay culture and purportedly reducing the number of drag queens onstage to placate Migos, which, in her critics\u2019 minds, made her the villain.\n\u201cIntention is everything,\u201d Ms. Perry told me, repeating one of her mantras. \u201cAll I was trying to do is build a bridge.\u201d\nBut Ms. Perry bears some responsibility for stoking fires. A chunk of promotional efforts for \u201cWitness\u201d leaned on the headline-generating magic of a feud: On \u201cCarpool Karaoke,\u201d she confirmed that \u201cSwish Swish\u201d is about her three-year-old rift with Taylor Swift. Ms. Swift struck back by  returning her catalog to streaming services at the same minute \u201cWitness\u201d was released. For all of Ms. Perry\u2019s talk about feminism and unity, it felt like a conventional catfight. But by the time of her live stream, she  softened her position. When she performed the song at the \u201cWitness World Wide\u201d finale, she changed the lyric \u201cDon\u2019t you come for me\u201d to \u201cGod bless you on your journey.\u201d\n\nTO APPRECIATE HOW Ms. Perry arrived at \u201cWitness,\u201d you have to understand her relationship to her biggest album, \u201cTeenage Dream.\u201d It had five No. 1 hits, tying a record Michael Jackson set with \u201cBad,\u201d and solidified her image as a charmingly goofy sexpot who sings about love, partying and inner strength. Her breezy persona belied the grueling work that went into touring, radio promotion and being the linchpin of a multimillion-dollar extravaganza.\nThe 2012 tour documentary \u201cKaty Perry: Part of Me\u201d captured a glimpse of the rigors: Her marriage to the comedian Russell Brand was crumbling as the burdens of becoming a superstar mounted. \u201cI was just kind of like a deer in headlights a little bit,\u201d she said. \u201cI was like, does this happen to people? Like, is this normal?\n\u201cWhen people are just talking about \u2018Teenage Dream,\u2019 I\u2019m like, please talk to me when you\u2019ve done that. And lived through it. Because it was [expletive] intense. And amazing and beautiful and horrible all at the same time.\u201d\nPart of the pressure stemmed from maintaining her hypersexual image, which Ms. Perry takes responsibility for helping create. \u201cI used to be scared of intimacy, I used to use my sexualization as attention, I used to oversexualize myself because that was the only way I knew how,\u201d she said. (Ms. Perry, who hit No. 1 with \u201cI Kissed a Girl,\u201d later explained why she holds queer women in high esteem: \u201cI admire that they\u2019re doing it for themselves. They are not doing it for the male gaze.\u201d) It\u2019s easy to read her drastic haircut and new stylistic choices \u2014 her live stream finale outfit covered her in neck-to-toe sequins \u2014 as a reaction to having worn whipped-cream bras in the past.\nMs. Perry credits her shift in perspective on her sexuality \u2014 she calls it \u201ca full sexual liberation\u201d \u2014 to resolving issues with her father. \u201cThe reality is that I was retriggered on the election,\u201d she said. \u201cI was retriggered by a big male that didn\u2019t see women as equal. And that had been, unfortunately, a common theme in my upbringing.\u201d\nSexism is also widespread in the music industry, where in the past year harassment and assault claims have been leveled at every echelon \u2014 top executives like L. A. Reid, creative powerhouses like Dr. Luke, indie rock bands like PWR BTTM.\nWhen she needs to speak with somebody who can relate, Ms. Perry said she turns to Sia, a songwriter and artist who has gone to great lengths to control how much (or in her case, how little) the public sees of her inner life. \u201cI think she\u2019s presently challenging old held beliefs about herself and that even in this day and age, cutting all your hair off and having an opinion is NOT WHAT THE PEOPLE WANT,\u201d Sia wrote in an email message. \u201cThey would prefer you to make cute pop and to stay in your lane.\u201d She added: \u201cI hide behind my wig, while she is out there taking bullets for the rest of us ... The less brave ... you know?\u201d\n\nTHE KATY PERRY viewers watched on \u201cWitness World Wide\u201d is the Katy Perry I spent several days with: gregarious, intense, bold, endearing and full of contradictions.\nIn our interview, she proclaimed herself devoted to dialogue but spoke in a near uninterrupted monologue. She griped frequently about the internet (the \u201cWild Wild West,\u201d a quip she repeated on the live stream nearly every time I tuned in), but she boasts the highest number of Twitter followers of any user and just allowed her digital audience to watch her eat, sleep and spread her new gospel on a 96-hour infomercial. She returned to words and phrases: good things are \u201cbeautiful\u201d; a desirable mate is \u201ca man of quality and equality\u201d (and for the record, she said Orlando Bloom was one, and Mr. Mayer and even Mr. Brand \u201care beautiful in their own right\u201d). And she revisited a pet subject: things that are \u201cnot real.\u201d\n\u201cAll the awards shows are fake,\u201d she said, \u201cand all the awards that I\u2019ve won are fake,\u201d she added, explaining that they don\u2019t represent the audience. \u201cThey\u2019re constructs.\u201d\nThe old Katy Perry wasn\u2019t a construct, she explained, and she isn\u2019t dead. \u201cI didn\u2019t kill her, because I love her, and she is exactly what I had to do then,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not a con artist, I didn\u2019t con people, like, that was just me. And this is me now.\u201d\nMs. Perry\u2019s awakening has been tapped as a marketing strategy for \u201cWitness,\u201d and the live stream was selling her authenticity: If you dig hearing about her new perspective, maybe you\u2019ll enjoy her song \u201cPower.\u201d While there are still plenty of relationship songs on \u201cWitness\u201d that will have fans wondering which of her beaus she misses more than she loved, seven tracks deal plainly with her new mind-set. The most direct is \u201cBigger Than Me,\u201d a statement of purpose akin to Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cMan in the Mirror\u201d (\u201cBut my intuition says there\u2019s a bigger mission I must embrace/So I\u2019m, I\u2019m pushing my thoughts to a new place\u201d).\nThough some of the subject matter is thorny and emotional, Ms. Glucksman described the making of \u201cWitness\u201d as \u201cthe most joyful professional process I have ever experienced.\u201d And Ms. Perry said she\u2019s the happiest she\u2019s ever been.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a departure, and it\u2019s a necessary evolution that I have to take,\u201d Ms. Perry said. \u201cAnd I know that sometimes it feels publicly like I\u2019m dragging cement blocks, but like, the pyramids were made out of cement blocks \u2014 or not cement. But do you know what I\u2019m trying to say? I\u2019m gonna get there.\u201d", "date": "June 14, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/14/arts/music/katy-perry-witness-interview.html", "tags": "woke tell album wants \u201d perry katy ms. like witness \u2014"}
