{"title": "Trump Administration Hands Democrats A Political Gift On Health Care", "content": "The Trump administration\u2019s intervention in an Obamacare lawsuit this week has handed Democrats a political gift, putting Republican candidates on the defensive about whether they, too, want to get rid of some of the law\u2019s most popular provisions.\nOn Thursday the Justice Department threw its support behind a lawsuit arguing that Obamacare\u2019s protections for people with pre-existing conditions are unconstitutional. The suit, brought by 20 states led by Republicans,\u00a0argue that those protections were supposed to work in tandem with the mandate that individuals have health insurance. Because Congress is no longer enforcing the mandate, they say, insurers no longer have to sell policies to everyone regardless of medical status.\nWhile this policy isn\u2019t new for the administration, the suit puts it front and center just as this year\u2019s midterm elections are heating up. And it means that Republican candidates, some in states that Donald Trump won in 2016, will have to make a decision: Do they back the president and say they don\u2019t believe insurers should have to cover people with pre-existing conditions, or do they publicly distance themselves from him?\u00a0\nDemocrats have wasted no time in taking advantage of the administration\u2019s move.\u00a0\nOn Monday the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee announced a five-figure digital ad campaign on Facebook,\u00a0focusing on voters in 20 districts. The ads, going after vulnerable GOP representatives, warn that Republicans will \u201cGUT protections for people with pre-existing conditions!\u201d\nThe Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee put out press releases in 12 states, urging people to ask GOP candidates and senators whether they think covering pre-existing conditions is unconstitutional.\u00a0\nAmerican Bridge, a super PAC focused on opposition research, also launched digital ads aimed at Republican Senate candidates in Nevada, Tennessee, Ohio, Missouri and West Virginia.\u00a0Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley and West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey in particular are targets, since they\u2019re co-counsels on the lawsuit.\nDemocratic senators up for re-election in states that Trump won \u2015\u00a0such as\u00a0Tammy Baldwin (Wis.), Joe Donnelly (Ind.), Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.) and Claire McCaskill (Mo.) \u2015 quickly put out statements blasting the administration for signing onto the suit.\u00a0\nState Democratic parties \u2014 in Missouri, Montana, West Virginia and Wisconsin \u2014 put out press releases tying Republican candidates to the Trump administration.\u00a0\nAnd candidates and advocacy groups have gone up with digital ads and fundraising \u2015 messages that will likely make their way into TV spots in the coming weeks.\u00a0\n\u201cAfter years of Republicans trying to repeal the protections stopping insurance companies from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, now Trump says the protections are unconstitutional,\u201d said Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic strategist who works with health care advocacy groups. \u201cRepublicans always had to defend those votes in this election, but now they have to defend his decree too.\u201d\u00a0\nHealth care is the top issue for Democrats this cycle, and it\u2019s the first time since the law\u2019s passage in 2010 that they\u2019re embracing it. For years, Republicans have made repealing Obamacare their top issue. But now that they\u2019re in office, with control of the House, the Senate and the White House, they\u2019ve dropped it as a talking point.\u00a0They weren\u2019t able to get repeal legislation through Congress, and public opinion has swung in favor of the law.\u00a0\nGOP spending on TV ads mentioning health care has dropped dramatically as well. In the last midterm elections in 2014,\u00a0anti-Obamacare forces spent $42,337,730 on TV ads, while pro-Obamacare forces spent\u00a0$6,283,210 through May, according to an analysis by Kantar Media/CMAG for HuffPost.\nSo far this cycle, by contrast, $11,445,830 has been spent on anti-Obamacare ads and\u00a0$9,293,210 on pro-Obamacare ads.\u00a0", "date": "\n06/12/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/health-care-trump-gift-to-democrats_n_5b1ed895e4b09d7a3d75d65e", "tags": "ads administration candidates democrats health pre-existing political conditions trump republicans gift democratic protections care hands"}
