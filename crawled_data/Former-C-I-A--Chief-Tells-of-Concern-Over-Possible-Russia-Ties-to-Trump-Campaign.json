{"title": "Former C.I.A. Chief Tells of Concern Over Possible Russia Ties to Trump Campaign", "content": "\u2022 John O. Brennan, the former director of the C.I.A., said publicly for the first time Tuesday that he was concerned about possible ties between Russia and the Trump campaign.\n\u2022 President Trump asked two top intelligence officials to deny the existence of any evidence of collusion between his campaign and Russia, former officials said. Both of the intelligence officials testified before lawmakers on Tuesday.\nMr. Brennan, the former C.I.A. director, said Tuesday that he became concerned last year that the Russian government was trying to influence members of the Trump campaign to act \u2014 wittingly or unwittingly \u2014 on Moscow\u2019s behalf.\n\u201cI encountered and am aware of information and intelligence that revealed contacts and interactions between Russian officials and U.S. persons involved in the Trump campaign that I was concerned about because of known Russian efforts to suborn such individuals,\u201d Mr. Brennan told lawmakers on the House Intelligence Committee.\n\u201cIt raised questions in my mind about whether Russia was able to gain the cooperation of those individuals,\u201d he said, adding that he did not know whether the Russian efforts were successful.\nHe added, \u201cI don\u2019t know whether such collusion existed.\u201d\nIt was the first time he publicly acknowledged that he was concerned about possible ties between Russia and the Trump campaign.\nHe said he left office in January with many unanswered questions about the Russian influence operation. Intelligence officials have said Russia tried to tip the election toward Mr. Trump.\nMr. Brennan became so concerned last summer about signs of Russian election meddling that he held urgent, classified briefings for eight senior members of Congress, speaking with some of them over secure phone lines while they were on recess. In those conversations, he told lawmakers there was evidence that Russia was working to elect Mr. Trump president.\nMr. Brennan was also one of a handful of officials who briefed both President Barack Obama and Mr. Trump in January on a broad intelligence community report revealing that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had personally ordered an \u201cinfluence campaign\u201d targeting the presidential election.\n\u2014 Matt Apuzzo\nWatch the hearing here:\nMr. Trump asked two of the country\u2019s top intelligence officials to make public statements saying there was no evidence of collusion between his campaign and Russian officials, hoping to undercut an F.B.I. investigation into meddling by Russia in the 2016 presidential election, two former American officials said.\nThe requests were made in late March to Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, and Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the chief of the National Security Agency. Both men rebuffed the request, which they saw as an inappropriate effort to inject politics into an intelligence and law enforcement matter, the former officials said.\nDays before, James B. Comey, then the F.B.I. director, had publicly acknowledged for the first time that the bureau was running a broad counterintelligence investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the presidential campaign and any possible collusion between associates of Mr. Trump and Russian officials. The revelation stung Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly said there was no collusion, and he wanted Mr. Coats and Admiral Rogers to publicly back him.\nOn the day of Mr. Comey\u2019s hearing, a call from the White House switchboard came in to Mr. Coats\u2019s office with a request to speak to the director, a former intelligence official said. Calls from the switchboard are usually from the highest officials at the White House \u2014 the president, the vice president or the national security adviser.\nMr. Coats took the call. The official would not confirm what was discussed.\nMr. Trump\u2019s requests to Mr. Coats and Admiral Rogers were first reported by The Washington Post.\n\u2014 Mark Mazzetti and Matthew Rosenberg\nSenator John McCain of Arizona, the Republican chairman of the Armed Services Committee, opened questioning at a hearing Tuesday by asking Mr. Coats about Mr. Trump\u2019s request to publicly dispute that any evidence exists of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\u201cIs that an accurate reporting, Director Coats?\u201d Mr. McCain asked.\nMr. Coats said he could not publicly discuss the subject.\n\u201cAs the president\u2019s principal intelligence adviser, I\u2019m fortunate to spend a significant amount of time with the president discussing national security interests and intelligence as it relates to those interests,\u201d Mr. Coats said. \u201cWe discuss a number of topics.\u201d\nBut because of the sensitivity of their conversations, Mr. Coats said, \u201cit\u2019s not appropriate for me to comment publicly on any of that.\u201d\nMr. McCain asked whether reports based on unnamed sources are problematic.\n\u201cLives are at stake in many instances, and leaks jeopardize those lives,\u201d Mr. Coats said.\n\u2014 Emmarie Huetteman\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee issued subpoenas Tuesday for documents from two businesses owned by Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, the committee\u2019s senior members said.\nThe move, coming the day after Mr. Flynn rejected the panel\u2019s subpoena for any emails or other records of any dealings with Russians, escalates his standoff with Senate investigators looking into potential collusion between Mr. Trump\u2019s associates and Russian officials.\nSenator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, the committee\u2019s Republican chairman, said panel members had also written back to Mr. Flynn\u2019s legal team, requesting clarity about whether the Fifth Amendment could indeed shield an individual from producing documents, as well as challenging his claim that the committee\u2019s previous requests for documents lacked specificity.\nMr. Burr left open the possibility of holding Mr. Flynn in contempt of Congress.\n\u201cAt the end of that option is a contempt charge,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve said that everything is on the table.\u201d\nBut the committee members are not ready to take that step, Mr. Burr said, adding that they want to give Mr. Flynn the opportunity he requested to tell his story.\nSenator Mark Warner of Virginia, the panel\u2019s top Democrat, said the subpoenas were for the firms Flynn Intel LLC and Flynn Intel Incorporated.\n\u201cWe disagree with General Flynn\u2019s lawyers\u2019 interpretation of taking the Fifth,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is even more clear that a business does not have a right to take the Fifth as a corporation.\u201d\nFlynn Intel Group was hired by a Turkish-American businessman to represent Turkish interests in a dispute with the United States government last year, while Mr. Flynn was advising the Trump campaign. He was paid more than $500,000. Mr. Flynn, who initially did not file the paperwork to disclose this connection, belatedly registered with the government as a foreign agent after being forced out of the Trump administration.\n\u2014 Emmarie Huetteman\nOne of the enduring questions about Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential election is whether the Russian government wanted to simply hurt Hillary Clinton or was actively trying to secure the election of Mr. Trump.\nAsked which one he believed to be the case, Mr. Brennan said: \u201cMy assessment is it was both.\u201d\nMr. Putin had long viewed Ms. Clinton as an implacable foe, he explained, and saw in Mr. Trump a businessman who might take a softer line on Russia.\n\u201cThey felt that Mr. Trump, being a bit of an outsider, that they in the past had some good relations with businessmen who happened to elevate into positions of government authority,\u201d Mr. Brennan said.\n\u201cThey clearly had a more favorable view toward Mr. Trump and actions they were taking were trying to increase his prospects, even though they probably thought they were not that great,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThey anticipated that Secretary Clinton was going to win the election, and I believe they tried to damage and bloody her before the election,\u201d Mr. Brennan said.\nAsked whether the Russians collected intelligence on Mrs. Clinton that they did not use during the campaign, Mr. Brennan responded that if they did, \u201ctheir efforts to denigrate her and hurt her would have continued during her presidency.\u201d\n\u2014 Matthew Rosenberg\nThe Trump administration said Tuesday that ethics experts had decided that Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel overseeing the federal investigation into possible Russian interference in the election, could carry out the inquiry even though his former law firm represents some of Mr. Trump\u2019s family members and his former campaign chairman.\nThe firm, WilmerHale, represents Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman, and Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka and son-in-law, Jared Kushner. While Mr. Mueller did not personally represent them, Reuters reported that the White House was considering using conflict-of-interest rules to undermine the investigation.\nMr. Mueller resigned his role as a partner at WilmerHale to become the special counsel.\nIn a statement on Tuesday, the Justice Department noted that its regulations permit a waiver to be issued and noted that professional responsibility rules permit Mr. Mueller to participate in matters involving his former law firm\u2019s clients \u201cso long as he has no confidential information about the client and did not participate in the representation.\u201d\n\u201cDepartment ethics experts have reviewed the matters and determined that Mr. Mueller\u2019s participation in the matters assigned to him is appropriate,\u201d the statement said.\n\u2014 Charlie Savage\nAsked whether he believed Russia would try to interfere in the 2018 midterm elections, Mr. Brennan said, \u201cI have, unfortunately, a grudging respect for Russian intelligence capabilities, their aggressiveness, their pervasiveness and their determination to do what they can do undermine this country\u2019s democracy and democratic institutions.\u201d\nHe said Russia would continue to try to \u201cexploit elections,\u201d but was also looking at other targets.\nRussian intelligence was aggressively trying to collect intelligence about prominent Americans both inside and outside the government, Mr. Brennan said. The Russians would use whatever information they obtained to gain influence over individuals who help shape American opinion.\n\u2014 Matthew Rosenberg", "date": "May 23, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/23/us/politics/congress-testimony-john-brennan-russia-budget.html", "tags": "possible tells intelligence officials \u201c russian concern former chief c.i.a trump ties russia campaign said"}
