{"title": "Pence Pounces On Rep- Ilhan Omar\u2019s Tweets, Suggests She Should \u2018Face Consequences\u2019", "content": "Vice President Mike Pence became the latest White House figure to criticize Rep. Ilhan Omar\u00a0(D-Minn.) for a series of controversial tweets some have called anti-Semitic.\nOmar\u2019s tweets \u201cwere a disgrace & her apology was inadequate,\u201d Pence wrote Tuesday on Twitter. \u201cThose who engage in anti-Semitic tropes should not just be denounced, they should face consequences for their words.\u201d\nThe vice president was weighing in on a controversy that has embroiled Omar for weeks, most recently over a series of tweets sent this weekend in which the lawmaker appeared to suggest that Republican lawmakers\u2019 support for Israel was simply about money.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about the Benjamins baby,\u201d Omar wrote in reply to a tweet sent by a journalist commenting on the GOP\u2019s defense of pro-Israeli policies.\nHer statements were immediately lambasted by fellow lawmakers, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.).\n\u201cAnti-Semitism must be called out, confronted and condemned whenever it is encountered, without exception,\u201d Pelosi said in a joint statement with colleagues in response to the remarks.\nOmar quickly addressed the tweets on Monday, saying she \u201cunequivocally apologized\u201d for feeding into negative stereotypes about the Jewish community.\n\u201cWe have to always be willing to step back and think through criticism, just as I expect people to hear me when others attack me for my identity,\u201d the lawmaker said.\nPresident Donald Trump weighed in Monday before a campaign-style rally in Texas for his border wall. He said that Omar should be \u201cashamed of herself\u201d and that her apology wasn\u2019t good enough. Asked what else she should do on the matter, he simply said Omar \u201cknows what to say.\u201d He later called on her to resign from Congress.\nOthers have said they accept her apology and would like to move on, including Rep. Max Rose (D-N.Y.), an early critic of the statements.\u00a0\n\u201cShe\u2019s a friend. I take her at her word,\u201d Rose told reporters Monday. \u201cWe share great values. She wants to see a great country, and I look forward to working with her.\u201d\nTrump himself has faced near-constant controversy for his xenophobia and racist attacks on many communities. He has regularly demeaned Mexicans and asylum seekers from Central America and has continued to mock Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) with anti-Native American rhetoric.\nIn 2016, he also drew fire for sharing an image of Hillary Clinton, then his Democratic presidential rival, that included a Star of David placed over an image of money. He later deleted the tweet, though he denied it was anti-Semitic.", "date": "\n02/12/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mike-pence-ilhan-omar_n_5c6380cce4b03de94296b6d5", "tags": "suggests face pounces \u2018 anti-semitic consequences omar pence \u201d called ilhan apology rep- monday tweets"}
