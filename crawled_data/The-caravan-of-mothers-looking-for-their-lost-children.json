{"title": "The caravan of mothers looking for their lost children", "content": "Every year for the past 13 years, a group of women have travelled 4,000km (2,485 miles) across Mexico searching for their children who went missing while migrating through the country from Central America.  Photojournalist Encarni Pindado has spoken to some of the women about their plight and what they aim to achieve with their Caravan of Mothers of Missing Migrants.\nThe caravan brings together mothers from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. \nThey cross the border between Guatemala and Mexico on inflatable rafts to symbolise the risks the migrants face when crossing into Mexico. \nThey then travel together across Mexico in search of their relatives who disappeared.\nIn the 13 years since the caravan was first organised by the Mesoamerican Migrant Movement, 270 missing migrants have been located.\nPart of the idea behind the caravan is also to denounce and highlight the issue of disappearances of migrants in transit through Mexico.\nOf the 270 missing migrants who have been found, 90% are men. Women are much harder to find, especially when they have been forced into the sex trade. In order to boost their chances of finding those women, the movement has forged links with organisations run by sex workers.\nThey place pictures of the missing migrants in brothels in the hope someone will recognise their loved ones.   \nClementina Murcia Gonz\u00e1lez has been part of the mothers' caravan for the last five years. Two of her sons went missing: Jorge in 1984 and Mauricio in 2001.\nWith the help of a a local radio station, Radio Progresso, she recently managed to track down Mauricio and will be reunited with him in the Mexican city of Guadalajara as part of this year's caravan.\n\"Sixteen kisses and 16 hugs is all I want from my son,\" she says about the impending reunion. \nHer search for Jorge continues. \nEdit Gutierrez's son left Honduras twice.\nThe first time he was kidnapped by Mexico's infamous drugs cartel, the Zetas, and witnessed how they killed and burned some of the other migrants he had travelled with.\nThe army eventually rescued him and deported him back to Honduras. \nIn August 2012, he left Honduras for the second time, paying a people smuggler $3,000 (\u00a32,250) to reach Reynosa, in the north of Mexico. \nThere he lost all communication with his family. \nIsidora de Jesus Zuniga Colindres from Honduras is searching for her son Josue Ildefonso Molinas Zuniga.\nJosue last called from the US-Mexican border town of Nuevo Laredo on 15 December, 2013. \nHe was headed to New York to join his father, who had received temporary protected status in the US years earlier, while his mother stayed behind in Honduras.   \nMar\u00eda Clementina V\u00e1squez Hern\u00e1ndez is from Honduras. She is looking for her daughter Mar\u00eda Ines who emigrated in 2002, leaving behind her infant son.\nMar\u00eda Clementina has been raising her grandson in Mar\u00eda Ines's absence. \n\"I'm not even sure what her face looks like now,\" she says about her daughter.\nMar\u00eda Elena Larios has been looking for her son Heriberto, who disappeared on 6 March, 2010. \nHe left La Libertad in El Salvador, to find work in the United States, but as far as Mar\u00eda Elena knows, he never made it. \nIn the southern Mexican town of Huixtla people tell her to look for her son at a Christian CD stand along the train tracks. \nBut when she arrives, she finds a slender young man from Honduras who resembles the photograph she carries of her Heriberto but who is not her son.\nPilar Escobar Medina from Honduras is searching for her daughter Olga, with whom she has had only very intermittent contact.\nOne day in September 2009, Olga did not return to her home in Honduras.\nFifteen days later she called her mother from the city of Tapachula on the Guatemala-Mexico border, saying she had \"ended up there\".\nMs Escobar did not hear from her again until earlier this year, when they planned a reunion. But in the months before they were due to meet, Olga's phone line went dead. \n\"Before migrants died of thirst, or were bitten by a snake while crossing the desert. Today they die at the hands of organised crime, and our girls, are raped by [people linked to] organised crime\" says Rosa Nelly Santos, who heads a committee for disappeared migrants in Honduras.\nMercedes Lemus (left) is searching for her daughter Ana Victoria, who went disappeared on 16 April, 2010. \nLast year, a woman in Huixtla told her that she had seen her daughter in a local bar.\nNeighbours confirmed that the picture of Ana Victoria resembled a woman they had seen around town with the bar's owner. \nBut when Mercedes asked for permission to enter the bar, the bouncer warned her that if she went in, she would not come out alive. \nAlong the way, the caravan meets local communities. In La Ceiba, a cultural and educational centre working with indigenous communities in Chiapas, the mothers are invited to a Mayan ceremony, a pre-hispanic ritual to connect with ancestors. \nAll photographs by Encarni Pindado.", "date": "17 December 2017", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-42357009", "tags": "mar\u00eda mothers missing son mexico went children daughter caravan honduras lost looking migrants year"}
