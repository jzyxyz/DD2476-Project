{"title": "Key Takeaways From The Full Redacted Mueller Report", "content": "A redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s long-awaited report on Russian interference in the 2016 election was released Thursday, allowing Congress and the American public to read the findings for themselves. \nAttorney General William Barr went to bat for Trump at a press conference on Mueller\u2019s report early Thursday\u00a0\u2014 minutes before the report\u2019s public release\u00a0\u2015 in which he repeatedly echoed the the president\u2019s refrain that there was \u201cno collusion\u201d during the 2016 election. The Trump-picked attorney general\u2019s decision to speak on the redacted report before it was sent to Congress drew fierce criticism from Democratic lawmakers, who then requested that Mueller testify about his findings before the House Judiciary Committee by next month.\nThroughout the special counsel\u2019s nearly two-year investigation, six Trump campaign associates and dozens of Russian operatives were charged with various crimes.\nHere are some key takeaways from the redacted report released to the public: \nThe report details multiple instances in which Trump may have obstructed justice by using his authority to interfere with the special counsel\u2019s investigation. Mueller declined to make a determination about whether the president obstructed justice. \n\u201cOur investigation found multiple acts by the President that were capable of exerting undue influence over law enforcement investigations, including the Russian-interference and obstruction investigations,\u201d the report states. \u201cThese incidents were often carried out through on-on-one meetings in which the President sought to use his official power outside of usual channels.\u201d \nThe report pointed to instances like Trump telling former White House Counsel Donald McGahn to fire Mueller as special counsel, and asking political operative Corey Lewandowski to tell then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to limit the scope of the investigation to future elections. \nHowever, an obstruction of justice charge would require the special counsel to determine that Trump\u2019s actions, which may have impeded the Russia probe, were done with that intent, Mueller said in the report. \u201cWhile this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him,\u201d the special counsel wrote.\nTrump may have been saved from an obstruction of justice charge by his own aides\u2019 refusal to follow his orders. \n\u201cThe President\u2019s efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons who surround the President declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests,\u201d Mueller wrote. \nThen-FBI Director James Comey, for instance, ignored Trump\u2019s request to stop investigating the president\u2019s first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who was later convicted of lying to the FBI; McGahn didn\u2019t help fire Mueller, and Lewandowski didn\u2019t pass along Trump\u2019s message to Sessions saying Mueller\u2019s investigation was unfair to the president and to limit its scope.\n\u201cThe Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in a sweeping and systematic fashion,\u201d Mueller wrote in the report. \nThe report goes into two main operations through which Russians interfered in the election: First a Russian group carried out a social media campaign designed to \u201csow discord\u201d in the U.S. political system, supporting then-candidate Trump and disparaging Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton; second, Russian intelligence hacked the Clinton campaign volunteers and employees and released stolen documents, infamously through WikiLeaks.\u00a0\nMueller\u2019s investigation found extensive links between members of the Trump campaign and Russian officials. \u201cThe links included Russian offers of assistance to the campaign,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn some instances, the Campaign was receptive to the offer, while in other instances the Campaign officials shied away.\u201d \nDespite establishing election interference by the Russian government, Mueller wrote that \u201cthe investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.\u201d \nThe special counsel report specifically said that it was looking at \u201cconspiracy\u201d and not \u201ccollusion\u201d (though Barr in his press conference on Mueller\u2019s report echoed the president\u2019s refrain that there was \u201cno collusion\u201d).\nThe special counsel found evidence of crimes outside its scope and made 14 criminal referrals to other jurisdictions. \nOnly two of the referrals are publicly known to date. Mueller found evidence of potential wire fraud and Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act violations related to Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s former personal fixer, and referred that evidence to federal prosecutors in New York and the FBI\u2019s New York Field Office. Cohen received three years in prison on charges including campaign finance violation and lying to Congress, and gave testimony in February that revealed the inner workings of the Trump campaign.\nThe second public criminal referral includes potential Foreign Agent Registration Act violations related to Gregory Craig and his former litigation firm, Skadden. A federal grand jury recently indicted Craig on charges of making false statements and hiding information from the Justice Department related to his and his firm\u2019s work on behalf of Ukraine. The charges stemmed from investigating former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his work on behalf of a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine.\n\u201cOh my God,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis is terrible. This is the end of my presidency. I\u2019m fucked.\u201d\nThat\u2019s how the president reacted in May 2017 to the news that Mueller had been appointed to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, according to the report. Trump was apparently livid at then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions when he broke the news of Mueller\u2019s appointment to the president, saying, \u201cHow could you let this happen, Jeff?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cEveryone tells me if you get one of these independent counsels it ruins your presidency. It takes years and years and I won\u2019t be able to do anything,\u201d Trump said, according to notes taken by Sessions\u2019 chief of staff Jody Hunt. \u201cThis is the worst thing that\u2019s ever happened to me.\u201d\nTrump later told The New York Times that he would never have appointed Sessions if he knew the attorney general would recuse himself from the Russia investigation.\nMueller\u2019s report addresses why Trump was never subpoenaed, which would have forced him to testify as part of the investigation into his campaign and Russian interference in the election. \nEssentially, after the president \u201cwould not be interviewed voluntarily,\u201d per the report, the special counsel\u2019s office \u201cweighed the costs\u201d of a potentially long legal battle to obtain an interview with Trump versus the value of completing the investigation sooner. Mueller\u2019s team ultimately decided it had gathered enough information from other sources for its investigation. \u00a0\nThroughout Mueller\u2019s nearly two-year investigation, the special counsel repeatedly sought to interview Trump. Ultimately, Trump ended up submitting written answers to some of Mueller\u2019s questions in November 2018 \u2015 which the report called \u201cinadequate.\u201d The president reportedly only answered questions related to Russia\u2019s interference in the election, and not about whether he tried to obstruct the investigation into his campaign\u2019s potential links with Russian meddling.\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders claimed that the president only fired FBI Director James Comey because Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had recommended it. Mueller\u2019s report, however, indicates that Sanders\u2019 May 2017 explanation for the president\u2019s actions was not true; Trump wanted Comey gone because the director wouldn\u2019t publicly state that the president was not under investigation. \n\u201cIn the immediate aftermath of the firing, the President dictated a press statement suggesting that he had acted based on the [Department of Justice] recommendations, and White House press officials repeated that story,\u201d Mueller wrote in his report. \u201cBut the President had decided to fire Comey before the White House solicited those recommendations.\u201d\nSanders also admitted that when she told reporters the \u201crank-and-file of the FBI had lost confidence in their director,\u201d her statement had no basis in fact, as was reported at the time.\nDonald Trump Jr. eventually ended up tweeting out screenshots of emails setting up the now-infamous June 2016 meeting between himself, senior Trump campaign officials and a Kremlin-linked lawyer said to be offering information that would damage Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. Before that, though, his father had attempted to cover up the true reason for the meeting, held at Trump Tower in Manhattan. \nTrump never wanted his son\u2019s correspondence to become public. In the summer of 2017, the president repeatedly told Hope Hicks, then serving as a communications adviser, that he did not even want to speak about the emails, which she believed would be inevitably leaked. Trump did not believe her.\nLater, however, the president ended up \u201cedit[ing] a press statement for Trump Jr. by deleting a line that acknowledged that the meeting was with \u2018an individual who [Trump Jr.] was told might have information helpful to the campaign\u2019\u201d \u2015 instead, he stated only that the meeting was about adoption. Michael Cohen, at the time still serving as Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, repeatedly denied that the president had helped craft the story given to reporters.", "date": "\n04/18/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mueller-report-explained-release-trump_n_5cb8d895e4b068d795ca7c0d", "tags": "redacted full key report \u201c investigation russian counsel takeaways campaign mueller"}
