{"title": "Soros Foundations Leaving Hungary Under Government Pressure", "content": "WARSAW \u2014 Under intense political pressure and the threat of legal sanctions, George Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations said on Tuesday that it had become impossible to work in Hungary, whose prime minister has blamed Mr. Soros for the country\u2019s problems, and that the foundations would move their operations to Berlin.\nThe foundations, which promote democracy, free expression and civil rights, have come under growing political and legal pressure from Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has stifled dissent and declared last week that \u201cthe era of liberal democracy is over.\u201d The foundations have been a frequent target of the Hungarian government, and Mr. Orban himself has painted Mr. Soros as a shadowy figure seeking to undermine the country\u2019s sovereignty.\n\u201cThe government of Hungary has denigrated and misrepresented our work and repressed civil society for the sake of political gain, using tactics unprecedented in the history of the European Union,\u201d Patrick Gaspard, president of the foundations, said on Tuesday.\nThe decision to close the groups\u2019 offices in the country of Mr. Soros\u2019s birth \u2014 they will continue to operate in many other countries \u2014 is the grim culmination of years of struggle to work in an increasingly hostile environment. Mr. Soros, 87, a Jew who survived the Nazi occupation of Budapest during World War II, later made a fortune in the financial markets, and he created the foundations and donated billions of dollars to them.\nMr. Orban campaigned on a nationalist, anti-immigrant platform, and vowed during the most recent campaign to seek revenge against those he deemed enemies of the state. He has proposed what is commonly referred to as a \u201cStop Soros\u201d law, aimed at penalizing nongovernmental agencies that assist asylum seekers and refugees.\nThe legislation, as it was written before the election, would force aid agencies working with migrants to apply for and receive national security clearance from the Interior Ministry. Additionally, groups receiving foreign funding \u2014 which includes almost all of the major nongovernmental organizations in the country \u2014 would have to pay a 25 percent tax on those contributions, a burden that many said would make it impossible to keep working in Hungary.\nOn Monday, Antal Rogan, the minister for Mr. Orban\u2019s cabinet office, said the government would propose an even \u201ctighter\u201d Stop Soros bill, but he provided no details. The legislation is likely to come up for a vote within the next month.\nMr. Orban\u2019s party, Fidesz, along with a smaller coalition partner, holds two-thirds of the seats in Parliament, and can probably pass whatever legislation it sees fit \u2014 including changes to the Constitution.\nLeaders of the Open Society said that even without the approval of the law, being based in the country had become untenable.\n\u201cIt has become impossible to protect the security of our operations and our staff in Hungary from arbitrary government interference,\u201d Mr. Gaspard said.\nBut the groups\u2019 leaders vowed to continue to promote civil society in Hungary.\nCentral European University in Budapest, another institution that was founded and funded by Mr. Soros, remains in a state of limbo. Under current law, it cannot accept new students after January 2019; if it cannot reach a compromise with the government, it may also be forced to leave the country.\nMr. Soros has spent hundreds of millions of dollars in Hungary to promote political freedom, beginning when it was under one-party Communist rule. The foundations have worked in the country since 1984.\nIn 1988, as the grip of the Soviet Union began to weaken, one of those who appealed to the Soros organization for funding was a young firebrand named Viktor Orban. He wanted money to study grass-roots democracy and how nations transition from dictatorships to democracies.\n\u201cOne of the main elements of this transition can be the rebirth of civil society,\u201d he wrote at the time.\nThat past connection makes the current moment that much more remarkable.\nThree decades later, civil society groups and Western officials have accused Mr. Orban of undermining the basic tenets of democracy in order to tighten his own grip on power and create a one-party state. The European Union has even threatened to cut aid to Hungary and Poland over their drift toward autocratic rule.\nMr. Orban has held onto power in large part by focusing on a single issue: the migration crisis that reached its peak in 2015. He has framed the issue as a battle for the survival of the nation, where migrants, many of them Muslims, will subvert the country\u2019s Christian traditions.\nIt hardly seemed to matter during the campaign that few migrants are seeking to transit through Hungary. Mr. Orban successfully used the issue to accuse officials in Brussels and other Western leaders of seeking to undermine Hungary\u2019s sovereignty.\nNo figure featured more prominently in the campaign than Mr. Soros.\nHis image appeared on tens of thousands of posters plastered around the country, often edited to make it appear \u2014 falsely \u2014 that he and leading opposition candidates were holding fence-cutting equipment, ready to throw open the nation\u2019s borders.\nIn a statement, the foundations said the government had spent \u201cmore than 100 million euros\u201d on a propaganda campaign against the group, including \u201cinvoking anti-Semitic imagery from World War II.\u201d\nMr. Soros, who lives in New York City, has denied as absurd the claims leveled against him. As Mr. Orban\u2019s rhetoric and the personal attacks intensified, Mr. Soros struck back in a 2017 speech about European integration.\nAt the time, he said he was \u201cfull of admiration for the courageous way the Hungarian people have resisted the deception and corruption of the mafia state the Orban regime has established.\u201d\nBut on Tuesday, the roughly 100 employees of the foundations started packing up their offices.", "date": "May 15, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/15/world/europe/soros-philanthropy-hungary-viktor-orban.html", "tags": "country hungary leaving orban \u201d foundations soros government pressure \u2014"}
