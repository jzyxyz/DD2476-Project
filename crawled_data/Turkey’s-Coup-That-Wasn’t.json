{"title": "Turkey\u2019s Coup That Wasn\u2019t", "content": "As coups go, the Turkish effort was a study in ineptitude: No serious attempt to capture or muzzle the political leadership, no leader ready to step in, no communication strategy (or even awareness of social media), no ability to mobilize a critical mass within either the armed forces or society. In their place a platoon of hapless soldiers on a bridge in Istanbul and the apparently uncoordinated targeting of a few government buildings in Ankara.\nIt was enough for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, speaking on his cellphone\u2019s FaceTime app, to call supporters into the streets for the insurrection to fold. That Erdogan will no doubt be the chief beneficiary of this turmoil, using it to further his push for an autocratic Islamist Turkey, does not mean that he staged it. The Turkish Army remains isolated from society. It is entirely plausible that a coterie of officers believed a polarized and disgruntled society would rise up once given a cue. If so, they were wrong \u2014 and the error has cost more than 260 lives.\nBut in Erdogan\u2019s Turkey, mystery and instability have become the coin of the realm. It is no wonder that conspiracy theories abound. Since an electoral setback in 2015, the president has overseen a Turkey that is ever more violent. This dangerous lurch has enabled him to bounce back in a second election in November and portray himself as the anointed one averting mayhem. His attempt to blame, without any evidence, the attempted coup on Fethullah Gulen, a Muslim cleric and erstwhile ally living in Pennsylvania, forms part of a pattern of murkiness and intrigue.\nThrough Erdogan\u2019s fog this much seems clear: Over 35 years after the last coup, and almost 20 years after the 1997 military intervention, Turks do not want a return to the seesawing military and civilian rule that marked the country between 1960 and 1980. On the contrary, they are attached to their democratic institutions and the constitutional order. The army, a pillar of Kemal Atat\u00fcrk\u2019s secular order, is weaker. Every major political party condemned the attempted coup. Whatever their growing anger against the president, Turks do not want to go backward.\nA successful coup would have been a disaster. Erdogan has massive support in the Anatolian heartland, particularly among religious conservatives. Mosques all over the country were lit through the night as imams echoed the president\u2019s call for people to pour into the street. There can be little doubt that any military-controlled administration would have faced a Syria-like insurgency of Islamists and others. The blow to what is left in the Middle East of democratic institutions and the rule of law would have been devastating.\nNo wonder President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry \u201cagreed that all parties in Turkey should support the democratically-elected Government of Turkey, show restraint, and avoid any violence of bloodshed.\u201d\nBut \u201crestraint\u201d is not part of Erdogan\u2019s vocabulary. As Philip Gordon, a former special assistant to Obama on the Middle East, told me: \u201cRather than use this as an opportunity to heal divisions, Erdogan may well do the opposite: go after adversaries, limit press and other freedoms further, and accumulate even more power.\u201d Within hours, over 2,800 military personnel had been detained and 2,745 judges removed from duty.\nA prolonged crackdown on so-called \u201cGulenists,\u201d whoever Erdogan deems them to be, and the Kemalist \u201cdeep state\u201d (supporters of the old secular order) is likely. An already divided society will grow more fissured. Secular Turkey will not quickly forget the cries of \u201cAllahu akbar\u201d echoing from some mosques and from crowds in the streets.\nA rapid push by Erdogan to reform the Constitution by referendum and create a presidency with sweeping powers is possible. He now has a case to say only such powers will keep enemies at bay.\n\u201cIt may well be that democracy has triumphed in Turkey only to be strangled at a slower pace,\u201d Jonathan Eyal, the international director at Britain\u2019s Royal United Services Institute, told me. There can be little doubt the expressions of support for Erdogan from Western capitals came through gritted teeth.\nFor the Obama administration, the dilemmas of the Middle East could scarcely have been more vividly illustrated. When an Egyptian general, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, led a coup three years ago against the democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsi, Obama did not support the democratic government, as he has now in Turkey. The administration even avoided use of the word \u201ccoup\u201d in Egypt. In effect, the president sided with the generals in the name of order.\nTrue, Morsi was deeply unpopular. The Egyptian coup had massive support. It was a fait accompli by the time Obama weighed in. Still, principles in the Middle East are worth little. Policy often amounts to choosing the least bad option.\nThe least bad \u2014 Erdogan\u2019s survival \u2014 has prevailed. That does not mean much worse won\u2019t follow. A failed coup doesn\u2019t mean democracy is the winner. The worst of this prickly autocrat may now be unleashed upon Turkey, with America and its allies able to do little about it.", "date": "July 16, 2016", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/18/opinion/turkeys-coup-that-wasnt.html", "tags": "support turkey society \u201d obama coup erdogan"}
