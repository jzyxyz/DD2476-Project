Most Economists Don\u2019t.", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s fixation  with America\u2019s widening trade deficit is fueling his decision to impose stiff tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Only a small group of experts share Mr. Trump\u2019s fixation, and few see tariffs as an effective tool to narrow the so-called trade gap.\nAmerica\u2019s trade deficit is the gap between how much in goods and services it imports from foreign countries, and how much it exports. Mr. Trump complains about the metric frequently, saying the trade imbalance is a measure of America\u2019s weakness on trade policy.\n\u201cWe lost, over the last number of years, $800 billion a year,\u201d he said in the White House on Monday, while defending his tariffs against criticism from Republican leaders in Congress. \u201cNot a half a million dollars, not 12 cents. We lost $800 billion a year on trade.\u201d He went on to say that the country \u201clost $500 billion\u201d a year to China, though it was not clear what figure he was citing, given that America\u2019s annual trade deficit with China has never climbed beyond $375 billion.\nMost economists do not see the trade gap as money \u201clost\u201d to other countries, nor do they worry about trade deficits to a large degree. That\u2019s because trade imbalances are affected by a host of macroeconomic factors, including the relative growth rates of countries, the value of their currencies, and their saving and investment rates. For instance, America\u2019s trade deficit narrowed dramatically during the Great Recession, when national consumption faltered.\nMr. Trump has long argued that the trade deficit hinders economic growth, and that reducing it will accelerate American job creation. Even those who agree with that view say there are better ways to reduce the imbalance than through tariffs, which can backfire and further widen the trade deficit if other countries impose reciprocal tariffs.\n\u201cIf you look across countries, there\u2019s no evidence that high tariffs reduce your trade deficit,\u201d said Joseph E. Gagnon, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, and a co-author of a 2017 book of policy recommendations on how to reduce trade imbalances.\n\u201cThe trade deficit is a terrible metric for judging economic policy,\u201d said Lawrence H. Summers, a Harvard economist and former chairman of President Barack Obama\u2019s National Economic Council. Mr. Summers said tariffs would actually worsen deficits by making American companies that ship steel and aluminum overseas less competitive, and by inviting foreign retaliatory tariffs against other exports.\nA year ago, Mr. Trump signed an executive order directing the Commerce Department and the United States trade representative to conduct a 90-day review on the causes of America\u2019s persistent trade deficits. That review has not yet been released. The Bureau of Economic Analysis reported last month that the trade deficit grew to 2.9 percent of gross domestic product in 2017, up from 2.7 percent the year before.\nThe deficit in goods alone with China grew to $375 billion last year, an 8 percent increase from 2016.\nThe deficit in goods and services is on pace to reach about $330 billion, depending on fourth-quarter data that has not yet been reported, which would also be an increase from the year before.\nThe tangible source of America\u2019s persistent trade deficit with China is consumer goods: electronics, housewares and so much else that Americans buy regularly at Walmart or Costco. Those deficits have been exacerbated, economists generally agree, through concerted action by the Chinese government to prop up exports, by holding down the value of China\u2019s currency and directly subsidizing some exporting industries.\nWhen it was admitted to the World Trade Organization in 2001, China got access to markets around the world and in turn committed to opening its own markets to countries such as the United States, said Eswar S. Prasad, a trade economist at Cornell University. \u201cChina did not keep up its end of the bargain,\u201d Mr. Prasad said. \u201cIt did not provide easy access to its own markets. And for a long period after the Asian financial crisis \u2014 2000 until the end of that decade \u2014 they gave themselves a competitive advantage by holding down the value of their currency.\u201d\nThe United States actually runs a trade surplus in services with China, as it does with many other countries, in part by attracting Chinese students to study at American colleges, which counts as an export.\nMr. Prasad and most other trade experts say bilateral trade deficits are not a good measure of whether countries are living up to their promises on market access, or whether certain countries are better negotiators of trade agreements. They compare the global economy to a neighborhood. Consumers might spend a lot of money with a shopkeeper who never buys anything from their store in return, but they also receive money from other customers whose stores they never frequent.\n\u201cA bilateral balance doesn\u2019t really tell you anything about what the economy is doing,\u201d said Scott Lincicome, an adjunct fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, \u201cjust like my bilateral deficit with my grocery store doesn\u2019t tell you anything about whether I\u2019m in debt.\u201d\nMr. Trump\u2019s own Council of Economic Advisers, in a report last month, seemed to play down alarms over bilateral trade deficits. \u201cThe United States has a bilateral goods deficit and a services surplus with many of its major trading partners,\u201d council members wrote. \u201cOverall, the United States has a goods deficit and a services surplus with the world. The services surplus is consistent with the structure of the private sector, which has evolved during the last few decades toward more services output as a share of G.D.P.\u201d\nEconomists who share Mr. Trump\u2019s concern with the overall trade deficit, or at least some degree of it, say there are better ways than tariffs to reduce it. Dean Baker, a liberal economist who writes frequently on trade policy, said targeting currency values is the best route; if other countries\u2019 currencies strengthen relative to the dollar, it becomes more attractive for their consumers to buy American exports.\nMr. Gagnon has a list of recommendations but said one dwarfs all others: reducing America\u2019s growing federal budget deficit, which is fueling foreign investment in the United States as the government turns to other nations to finance its spending.\n\u201cThere are things we could do,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I hate to recommend them when we\u2019re not doing the most important thing, which is bring down our massive fiscal deficit.\u201d\nMr. Trump, he noted, recently signed  sweeping tax cuts that will add an estimated $1 trillion to federal deficits over the next 10 years, even after accounting for the faster growth it could bring.", "date": "March 5, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/us/politics/trade-deficit-tariffs-economists-trump.html", "tags": "hates america economists \u201d trump countries tariffs trade deficit"}
