{"title": "Washington Won't Fix Obamacare Costs, So These States Are Doing It Themselves", "content": "Washington had its turn to remake the health care system when President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act\u00a0seven years ago, and again this year when the effort by President Donald Trump and the GOP Congress\u00a0to repeal and replace the law\u00a0collapsed. Now, it may be up to the states to finish the job.\nLarge premium increases and diminishing choice among insurers are a real problem in some states\u2019 Obamacare markets. Alaska and Minnesota, which suffered among the biggest premium increases\u00a0this year, are at the forefront in trying to find solutions.\nAnd the Affordable Care Act itself can help them obtain federal funding for those new ideas.\n\u201cOur market got skewered last summer,\u201d Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton (D) said in an interview Friday. \u201cI don\u2019t know how political leaders in other states handle that, but in Minnesota, I think we pretty much \u2015 Republicans and Democrats \u2015 agreed we needed to respond.\u201d\nOn Monday, Minnesota became the second state,\u00a0after Alaska, to establish a special fund that reimburses health insurers\u00a0hit with extraordinarily high costs because of a small number of very sick policyholders. Alaska set up its two-year, $55 million \u201creinsurance\u201d program using state funding in 2016. The happy result: What was expected to be an average 42 percent rate hike for Alaska\u2019s individual insurance market this year turned into a 7 percent increase.\nMinnesota is hoping to replicate that success with a $542 million program to backstop insurance company expenses. Because of looming rate hikes, the North Star State had already\u00a0provided relief to people who buy their health insurance plans directly from insurers or use the state\u2019s exchange, MNSure, in the form of rebates financed with $326 million in state money.\nOther states could look to these models as ways to shore up their health insurance markets in the face of high prices for unsubsidized policies sold on HealthCare.gov, state-run marketplaces like MNSure and directly from insurers or through brokers.\nThe health of Affordable Care Act markets varies greatly from state to state.\u00a0Those with large rural areas,\u00a0like Alaska and Minnesota, tend to have bigger problems, largely because the cost of providing health care in remote regions is higher and the potential scale of insurance markets there is smaller and less attractive to insurance companies.\n\u201cAlaskans want every medical service that you would expect to get in a large city, and to provide that to a small population, it\u2019s expensive,\u201d said Lori Wing-Heier, director of the Alaska Division of Insurance.\nThe Affordable Care Act has an option that allows states to try new ideas while receiving federal money to make them happen.\u00a0If a state can devise another way to provide comparable health coverage to the same number of people as the Affordable Care Act does, it can apply for federal permission to do so. So-called\u00a0state innovation waivers, also dubbed Section 1332 waivers after the part of the statute that authorizes them, run five years.\nStates across the nation are weighing whether to use these waivers, which first became available this year, to customize Obamacare for their residents. Alaska submitted its application in late 2016 to transition its state-funded reinsurance program into one that receives federal money, and Minnesota plans to do the same.\u00a0\nWhat\u2019s more, despite Trump\u2019s continued commitment to eliminating the Affordable Care Act itself and his\u00a0veiled threats to undermine the law, his administration is encouraging states to apply for innovation waivers.\n\u201cWe are seeking to empower states with new opportunities that will strengthen their health insurance markets,\u201d Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price wrote to governors on March 13. \u201cWe welcome the opportunity to work with states on Section 1332 State Innovation Waivers,\u201d he wrote, specifically highlighting Alaska\u2019s efforts as a blueprint for others.\n\u201cIt will spread,\u201d Wing-Heier said. \u201cWhen Secretary Price issued his letter encouraging people to apply, I think people had to at least give it serious thought.\u201d\nThe Alaska and Minnesota model works like this: States authorize funding to set up reinsurance programs, which reimburse certain costs to insurers. Those costs are thereby moved off the insurers\u2019 books, meaning they aren\u2019t factored into the following year\u2019s rate increases, which in turn reduces rate hikes and makes coverage more affordable for all customers.\nLower premiums also mean less federal spending goes to health insurance subsidies. So the Section 1332 waivers would allow states to finance their reinsurance pools by tapping into that money that would\u2019ve otherwise been spent on subsidies.\nPrice specifically urged states to consider their own reinsurance programs or to set up high-risk pools for the costliest enrollees. The Affordable Care Act had offered a national reinsurance program, but it expired last year.\nAlaska Gov. Bill Walker, a Republican-turned-independent, and the state\u2019s GOP-led legislature acted swiftly last year when Premera Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alaska requested a large rate increase and Moda Health announced it was leaving the state\u2019s individual insurance market. The state instituted its two-year reinsurance plan and now hopes the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services will approve its waiver request, which would extend the program through 2021.\n\u201cWe expect that it will be approved by Secretary Price,\u201d Wing-Heier said. In January, then-HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell\u00a0wrote the governor\u00a0that the preliminary assessment indicated Alaska\u2019s request would be granted.\nDayton, Minnesota\u2019s governor, said his administration has been in talks with federal officials about a waiver and could submit the documentation as soon as this week. \u201cThe timing is very crucial,\u201d he said. Insurers have to submit their rate increase requests for next year in less than three months.\nStill,\u00a0Dayton had several serious misgivings about the legislation,\u00a0approved by Minnesota\u2019s majority-Republican legislature last week, to establish the reinsurance program. On Monday, he notified lawmakers that he wouldn\u2019t veto the bill\u00a0but would allow it to become law without his signature.\nThe Minnesota program doesn\u2019t require insurance companies to pass along their savings from reinsurance payments by lowering premium increases for customers or to remain in the state\u2019s individual insurance market, Dayton said.\n\u201cGiven the amount of money it was going to cost the state treasury, I thought \u2015 not just myself \u2015 I thought all Minnesotans were entitled to answers and assurances,\u201d he said.\nThe governor wrote letters to the four relevant insurers last month seeking such promises. \u201cI did not receive a single reply from a single one of the insurance companies to whom I sent that, which I find shocking that they would not even have the decency to respond,\u201d he said.\nDayton also wanted to turn the MinnesotaCare program, which is currently available to lower-income people who earn too much for Medicaid coverage, into\u00a0a state-based public option that anyone could choose to buy into. The legislature rejected the idea.\nLooking beyond the Alaska and Minnesota programs, states can use innovation waivers to transform their health care markets in other ways, nudging them in more conservative or liberal directions.\nThe most ambitious potential waiver request might have come from Vermont, which planned to use the tool to implement a single-payer system. But the state abandoned the effort\u00a0in 2014 when policymakers couldn\u2019t agree on how to finance such a system. The federal government has already approved Hawaii\u2019s waiver to make smaller tweaks to its insurance market to align with previous state laws, and California has applied for permission to enroll undocumented immigrants on its state exchange, Covered California.\nIn Oklahoma, the state government is weighing a sweeping array of reforms to its troubled health insurance market that would utilize the innovation waivers, according to a 65-page outline\u00a0published last month.\u00a0Among other things, Oklahoma may abandon the federal HealthCare.gov platform for a state-based enrollment system, simplify health insurance benefit design, and provide subsidies to lower-income households while cutting them off for some middle-income people.\nThe Trump administration has a strong incentive to work with states that want to find their own solutions to insurance costs and competition. Unless the White House really expects to score political points by allowing the Obamacare markets to suffer through inaction or sabotage, these waivers provide an opportunity to help ordinary Americans without congressional action or additional funding.", "date": "\n04/03/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/obamacare-state-innovation-waivers_n_58e24e27e4b0ba3595966b33", "tags": "care wo washington obamacare costs alaska states minnesota \u201d state fix insurance health"}
