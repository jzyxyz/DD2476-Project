{"title": "Pete Buttigieg- Donald Trump\u2019s Administration Is Radicalizing Americans", "content": "Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg has accused President Donald Trump\u2019s administration of radicalizing Americans.\nIn an\u00a0interview with Vox published on Thursday, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana noted that \u201cwhen people are economically or socially dislocated, they are always more vulnerable to being radicalized.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I think a lot of Americans are being radicalized by this administration,\u201d\u00a0 Buttigieg said. \u201cThe experience of disruption that\u2019s gone on, especially in the interior, has obviously made it more fertile to being taken advantage of by people like this president.\u201d\nButtigieg, who is openly gay, also hit back at critics who have claimed he was getting an easier ride on the early campaign trail than his female counterparts, such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).\n\u201cWell, if somebody is pointing out that there are advantages \u2014 many of them unfair \u2014 that go along with being male in our society and in our politics, then I completely agree,\u201d Buttigieg said.\nBut \u201cif somebody is saying that I should not compete because I\u2019m a man, I don\u2019t know what to say to that,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd if somebody is saying that I had it easy, I would invite them to join the military and enter Indiana politics in 2010 as a gay person. See how easy they find it.\u201d\nRead the full interview with Vox here.", "date": "\n03/29/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/pete-buttigieg-donald-trumps-administration-is-radicalizing-a-lot-of-americans_n_5c9dc097e4b0474c08cbc9f9", "tags": "somebody administration radicalizing buttigieg buttigieg- indiana pete trump \u201d interview donald vox americans"}
