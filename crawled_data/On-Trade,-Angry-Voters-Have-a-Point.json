{"title": "On Trade, Angry Voters Have a Point", "content": "Were the experts wrong about the benefits of trade for the American economy?\nThe nation\u2019s working class had another opportunity to demonstrate its political clout Tuesday, as primary voters went to the polls in Illinois and Ohio, Rust Belt states that have suffered intensely from the loss of good manufacturing jobs. Last week, the insurrection handed Michigan\u2019s Democratic primary to Bernie Sanders while continuing to buoy the insurgent Republican candidacy of Donald Trump.\nVoters\u2019 anger and frustration, driven in part by relentless globalization and technological change, may not propel either candidate to the presidency. But it is already having a big impact on America\u2019s future, shaking a once-solid consensus that freer trade is, necessarily, a good thing.\n\u201cThe economic populism of the presidential campaign has forced the recognition that expanded trade is a double-edged sword,\u201d wrote Jared Bernstein, former economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\nWhat seems most striking is that the angry working class \u2014 dismissed so often as myopic, unable to understand the economic trade-offs presented by trade \u2014 appears to have understood what the experts are only belatedly finding to be true: The benefits from trade to the American economy may not always justify its costs.\nIn a recent study, three economists \u2014 David Autor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, David Dorn at the University of Zurich and Gordon Hanson at the University of California, San Diego \u2014 raised a profound challenge to all of us brought up to believe that economies quickly recover from trade shocks. In theory, a developed industrial country like the United States adjusts to import competition by moving workers into more advanced industries that can successfully compete in global markets.\nThey examined the experience of American workers after China erupted onto world markets some two decades ago. The presumed adjustment, they concluded, never happened. Or at least hasn\u2019t happened yet. Wages remain low and unemployment high in the most affected local job markets. Nationally, there is no sign of offsetting job gains elsewhere in the economy. What\u2019s more, they found that sagging wages in local labor markets exposed to Chinese competition reduced earnings by $213 per adult per year.\nIn another study they wrote with Daron Acemoglu and Brendan Price from M.I.T., they estimated that rising Chinese imports from 1999 to 2011 cost up to 2.4 million American jobs.\n\u201cThese results should cause us to rethink the short- and medium-run gains from trade,\u201d they argued. \u201cHaving failed to anticipate how significant the dislocations from trade might be, it is incumbent on the literature to more convincingly estimate the gains from trade, such that the case for free trade is not based on the sway of theory alone, but on a foundation of evidence that illuminates who gains, who loses, by how much, and under what conditions.\u201d\nGlobal trade offers undeniable benefits. It helped pull hundreds of millions of Chinese out of poverty in a matter of a few decades, an unparalleled feat. It ensured Apple could benefit from China\u2019s ample supply of cheap labor. Consumers around the world gained better-priced, better-made goods.\nStill, though trade may be good for the country over all \u2014 after netting out winners and losers \u2014 the case for globalization based on the fact that it helps expand the economic pie by 3 percent becomes much weaker when it also changes the distribution of the slices by 50 percent, Mr. Autor argued. And that is especially true when the American political system has shown no interest in compensating those on the losing side.\nThe impact of China\u2019s great leap into the market economy \u2014 which drew hundreds of millions of impoverished peasants into the manufacturing sector, mostly making goods for export to the United States and other wealthy nations \u2014 is waning. China\u2019s wages are rising fast. Its exports and economy are slowing.\nTrade with other parts of the world has not been as disruptive. For all the criticism of Nafta, most economists assess  its impact on American workers as modest. Trade flows with Mexico were smaller and more balanced than those with China. American manufacturing employment remained fairly stable in the years after Nafta came into force in 1994, plummeting only after China entered the World Trade Organization in 2001 and gained consistent access to markets in the United States.\nThe Chinese export onslaught, however, left a scar on the American working class that has not healed. That disproportionate impact suggests Washington officialdom might do well to reassess its approach to future trade liberalization. Most important, it points to reconsidering how policy makers deal with trade\u2019s distributional consequences.\nIt doesn\u2019t mean walling off the United States from the rest of the world, but it does mean learning from the experience of other advanced nations that had a much healthier response to China\u2019s rise.\nGermany, for example, not only received a surge of Chinese imports, but also experienced an onslaught of imports from Eastern European countries after the collapse of the Soviet bloc. But it managed to maintain a more balanced trade because German manufacturers increased their exports to all these countries too, offsetting the job losses from import competition.\nMr. Autor suggests that Americans\u2019 low savings rate was a big part of the story, coupled with foreigners\u2019 appetite for accumulating dollar assets, which helped keep American interest rates low and the dollar strong, in that way fueling a persistent trade deficit.\nBut other factors were at work. Robert Gordon of Northwestern University suggested to me that Germany\u2019s highly skilled workers were harder to replace with cheaper Chinese labor, limiting though not totally eliminating outsourcing. Germany\u2019s stronger labor unions also put up more of a fight.\nWashington played its part, too. In their new book \u201cConcrete Economics\u201d (Harvard Business Review Press), Stephen S. Cohen and J. Bradford DeLong of the University of California, Berkeley suggest that ultimately, it was the fault of American policy choices.\nThe United States might have leaned against China\u2019s export-led strategy, they argue, perhaps by insisting more forcefully that Beijing let its currency rise as its trade surplus swelled. It might have tried to foster the cutting-edge industries of the future, as government had done so many times before, encouraging the shift from textiles to jumbo jets and from toys to semiconductors.\nWhat Washington did, instead, was hitch the nation\u2019s future to housing and finance. But Wall Street, instead of spreading prosperity, delivered the worst recession the world had seen since the 1930s. Even at best, they write, the transformation of banking and finance has \u201cproduced nothing (or exceedingly little) of value.\u201d\nSo where should policy makers go from here?\nThere are no easy answers. Tearing up existing trade agreements and retreating behind high tariff barriers \u2014 as Mr. Trump, and perhaps Mr. Sanders, would have it \u2014 would be immensely unproductive. It would throw a wrench into the works of a wobbly world economy. And reneging on international treaties would vastly complicate the international coordination needed to combat climate change.\nBut in any future trade liberalization \u2014 including the Obama administration\u2019s pending Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, if it is to go forward at all \u2014 policy makers must be much more careful about managing the costs. Mr. Autor suggests any further deals to increase trade should be gradual, to give much more time for exposed companies and their workers to retool and shift into other jobs and sectors.\nPerhaps most important, the new evidence from trade suggests American policy makers cannot continue to impose all the pain on the nation\u2019s blue-collar workers if they are not going to provide a stronger safety net.\nThat might have been justified if the distributional costs of trade were indeed small and short-lived. But now that we know they are big and persistent, it looks unconscionable.", "date": "March 15, 2016", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/business/economy/on-trade-angry-voters-have-a-point.html", "tags": "american world china voters states economy workers chinese trade future point \u2014 angry"}
