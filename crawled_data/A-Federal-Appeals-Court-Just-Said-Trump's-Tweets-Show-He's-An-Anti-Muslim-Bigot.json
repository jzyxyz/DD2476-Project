{"title": "A Federal Appeals Court Just Said Trump's Tweets Show He's An Anti-Muslim Bigot", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2015 In an extraordinary ruling on Thursday, the majority of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit found that\u00a0\u201cthe words of the President\u201d provided \u201cundisputed evidence\u201d of anti-Muslim bias.\nIn a 9-4 ruling, the federal appeals court held that the third version of Trump\u2019s travel ban \u2015 which limited visitors from six majority-Muslim countries as well as two other nations \u2015 was likely unconstitutional. It was the second federal appeals court to find that Trump\u2019s third travel ban was likely unconstitutional, but both rulings have been put on hold until the U.S. Supreme Court hears oral arguments in the matter this spring.\nThe 4th Circuit\u2019s majority opinion,\u00a0written by Chief Judge Roger Gregory, represents yet another instance in which the president\u2019s own words \u2015 and tweets \u2015 have hurt his arguments in court. This has happened to Trump\u00a0again and again\u00a0and again.\nThe 4th Circuit found that Trump had expressed \u201cwhat any reasonable observer could view as general anti-Muslim bias.\u201d In addition to statements from the campaign trail, the opinion cited\u00a0Trump\u2019s retweets of anti-Muslim videos posted by a far-right British political party in November as well as this tweet from August:\n\u201cThe President\u2019s own words \u2015 publicly stating a constitutionally impermissible reason for the Proclamation \u2015 distinguish this case,\u201d the majority found.\nWhile Trump could have \u201cremoved the taint of his prior troubling statements,\u201d he hasn\u2019t, the court said. \u201cIn fact, instead of taking any actions to cure the \u2018taint\u2019 that we found infected [the second executive order laying out a travel ban], President Trump continued to disparage Muslims and the Islamic faith,\u201d it said.\nFrom the opinion:\nThe Trump administration had urged the court to disregard the president\u2019s pre-election statements,\u00a0perhaps the court said in\u00a0\u201cimplicit recognition of the rawness of the religious animus\u201d in those statements.\u00a0But the government\u2019s argument that what he said before he was elected wasn\u2019t relevant didn\u2019t hold up, the 4th Circuit said.\n\u201cThis is a difficult argument to make given that the President and his advisors have repeatedly relied on these pre-election statements to explain the President\u2019s post-election actions related to the travel ban,\u201d the court wrote.\nFrom the opinion:\n\u201cIn sum, the face of the Proclamation, read in the context of President Trump\u2019s official statements, fails to demonstrate a primarily secular purpose. To the objective observer, the Proclamation continues to exhibit a primarily religious anti-Muslim objective,\u201d the court wrote.\nRead the entire opinion below:\nRyan Reilly is HuffPost\u2019s senior justice reporter, covering the Justice Department, federal law enforcement, criminal justice and legal affairs.
