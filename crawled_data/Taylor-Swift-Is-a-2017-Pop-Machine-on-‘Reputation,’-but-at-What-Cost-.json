{"title": "Taylor Swift Is a 2017 Pop Machine on \u2018Reputation,\u2019 but at What Cost?", "content": "Taylor Swift is known for the kiss-off, the eerily intimate way she dismantles those who have wronged her. She is a songwriter and performer who has long thrived on antagonism (it\u2019s one of her two poles; the other is swooning), and no pop star of the modern era has communicated the contours of her disappointment with such emotional precision and melodic sophistication.\n\u201cI Did Something Bad,\u201d which comes third on her new album, \u201cReputation,\u201d has all the hallmarks of a classic Swift assault: lyrics about men who are out of their depth sprinkled with just enough details to imply grave shortcomings.\nBut the chorus is something different: \u201cThey say I did something bad/Then why\u2019s it feel so good?\u201d On the surface, it\u2019s an awakening, but really, it\u2019s a takedown. The target is herself \u2014 her innocence, her na\u00efvet\u00e9, the way in which striving to be flawless is perhaps the ultimate flaw.\nThe bombastic, unexpected, sneakily potent \u201cReputation\u201d is many things: It\u2019s the first album on which Ms. Swift has cursed (\u201cdamn\u201d doesn\u2019t count); it\u2019s the first time she has sung about consuming alcohol (and repeatedly at that); and it\u2019s the vehicle for her most overt songs about sexual agency. Ms. Swift is 27 now, and the things she used to deny herself \u2014 in song, at least \u2014 are no more.\nBut it is also Ms. Swift chasing that good feeling, pushing back against a decade of following her own instincts. And it works. \u201cReputation\u201d is fundamentally unlike any of her other albums in that it takes into account \u2014 prioritizes, actually \u2014 the tempo and tone of her competition. \u201cReputation\u201d is a public renegotiation, engaging pop music on its terms, not hers.\nAnd even though what\u2019s au courant in pop \u2014 post-Drake lite-soul noir, or gothic but plain dramatists like Halsey and Selena Gomez \u2014 doesn\u2019t necessarily play to Ms. Swift\u2019s strengths, she barrels ahead here, finding ways to incorporate it into her arsenal, and herself into it. Some things are lost, to be sure, but it turns out that Ms. Swift is as effective a distiller of everyone else\u2019s pop ideas as she was at charting her own sui generis path.\nThat means a shift away from her signature melodies to an approach that uses her voice as an accent piece, or seasoning \u2014 the difference between songs that are 24K Taylor and ones that are merely Taylor-plated. It means a continued de-emphasis \u2014 one that began on her last album, \u201c1989\u201d \u2014 of the sorts of dense narratives that were so integral to her early career. It means that on a few songs here, Ms. Swift is doing something at least a little bit like rapping. (I\u2019m sorry, the old Taylor can\u2019t come to the studio right now.)\nMake no mistake: these are jarring propositions. And yet Ms. Swift commits to them and thrives, an act of liberation from her past, and also a calculation about what the marketplace can bear.\nThat\u2019s because after \u201c1989,\u201d all that was left for Ms. Swift to do was make pop songs the way most other superstars do. All the songs on \u201cReputation\u201d are produced either by Max Martin with his associates, or by Jack Antonoff with Ms. Swift. Both men are longtime collaborators of hers, and both have had an outsized role in shaping the sound of current pop.\nWhere they bring Ms. Swift is into soft-core pop-R&B, with synth-thick production that moves at a sensual gallop. \u201cDelicate,\u201d one of the album\u2019s standouts, could pass for a Drake-Rihanna collaboration. Here, Ms. Swift whisper-sings with a newfound attention to rhythm. (She also sings through a vocoder on part of the song.) Something similar, but even more outr\u00e9, is happening on \u201cDress,\u201d which \u2014 with Ms. Swift\u2019s blushing exhales \u2014 sounds like something the club-soul revivalists AlunaGeorge might make.\nThese songs emphasize the cadence of her singing, not the melody or range. And on a few other songs here, she breaks into a kind of intermittently unconvincing talk-singing. This is a persistent theme on this album: borrowing styles and approaches from black music, then softening them enough to where Ms. Swift can credibly attempt them.\nThe most striking example of this is \u201cEnd Game,\u201d a smoothly swaggering thumper featuring Future and Ed Sheeran. That Ms. Swift would go sigh for sigh with Future\u2019s warbles would have been unthinkable five years ago, but here, in a twist, the person who sounds least at home is Mr. Sheeran.\nThe ideas that Ms. Swift and her producers are borrowing from have been long simmering in the pop mainstream. (Nothing here has the same jolt as when she imported a dubstep drop into \u201cI Knew You Were Trouble,\u201d in 2012, back when that was still novel.) What\u2019s notable, though, is that she hasn\u2019t gone to the innovators of these ideas, but rather used Mr. Martin and Mr. Antonoff as alchemists and filters.\nThat approach also serves another purpose, which is to protect her from the limitations of her voice. A few songs here \u2014 \u201cDon\u2019t Blame Me,\u201d especially, which faintly recalls Madonna\u2019s gospel-choir era \u2014 call out for melisma, or a soul-informed vocal approach that blends the tough and the nimble. But those are not Ms. Swift\u2019s gifts. She is as strong a singer as ever (even if this album doesn\u2019t much let her loose), but much of her singing here is done piecemeal.\nThat\u2019s because almost all of these songs are the sum of very different parts; many move in several different directions, one hard turn after the next. Guitars, when they\u2019re present, are generally distant in the mix.\nThis kind of structural maximalism is becoming a hallmark of pop-era Swift. \u201cI Did Something Bad\u201d has the energy of a revving motorcycle, and the first two singles, \u201c \u2026 Ready for It?\u201d and \u201cLook What You Made Me Do,\u201d both use harsh sounds and urgent buildup segments to theatrical, bruising effect.\nThis is the work of both producers: Mr. Martin and his team handle most of the album\u2019s rowdy first half, and Mr. Antonoff is dominant on the more emotionally focused second half. Ms. Swift\u2019s tone changes throughout the album as well \u2014 in the beginning, she is indignant and barbed, but by the end she\u2019s practically cooing.\nShe still has adversaries in her sight; there are jabs at Kanye West, and also at an ex-boyfriend or two. But here, too, she turns the magnifying glass around. Some of the most caustic and aware songwriting on this album is about herself. \u201cGetaway Car\u201d is about what happens when you leap blithely from one relationship to another. Ms. Swift is at her imagistic best here: \u201cThe ties were black, the lies were white/in shades of gray in candlelight/I wanted to leave him, I needed a reason.\u201d\nThis is familiar Swift stuff \u2014 or at least, what was once familiar Swift stuff. On this album, it\u2019s no longer the priority. The album closer, \u201cNew Year\u2019s Day,\u201d is the only acoustic song, and also one of the best written (though it feels as indebted to Mr. Sheeran as to Ms. Swift).\nIt is also probably the only song here that, upon first listen, doesn\u2019t prompt the existential question of what, exactly, constitutes a Taylor Swift song in 2017. In making her most modern album \u2014 one in which she steadily visits hostile territory and comes out largely unscathed \u2014 Ms. Swift has actually delivered a brainteaser: If you\u2019re using other people\u2019s parts, can you ever really recreate your self?", "date": "Nov. 9, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/09/arts/music/taylor-swift-reputation-review.html", "tags": "pop \u2018 something songs album cost \u201d taylor one reputation machine ms. \u2014 swift"}
