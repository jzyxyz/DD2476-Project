{"title": "Anti-Abortion Harassment Goes Way Beyond Picketing Clinics", "content": "\u201cCan I pray for you?\u201d a woman asked after I shared my abortion story at the Women\u2019s March Convention in Detroit last year.\nShe walked up to the table and stretched out her hand. I declined. I recognized the organization she was with: \u201cAnd Then There Were None,\u201d an anti-abortion activist organization \u2015 founded by a former Planned Parenthood employee \u2015 that relentlessly harasses clinic staff with offers of money in exchange for leaving their jobs. Their mission, in their words, is to \u201clove an abortion clinic worker out of the industry.\u201d But the \u201clove\u201d they offer is not consensual; it\u2019s coercive and conditional, based on whether we do what they want. To me, that\u2019s not love. It\u2019s irritating and downright disrespectful.\nAnti-choice activists, or \u201cantis,\u201d are known for protesting outside of clinics, but some of their tactics targeting individuals, abortion providers, abortion storytellers and really anyone who supports us, aren\u2019t as widely known.\nFor decades, they have used protests, economic blackmail and even house calls\u00a0to target medical disposal vendors, banks and other contractors who build abortion clinics in an effort\u00a0to get them to cease construction or withhold services from abortion providers. In Kansas,\u00a0one group\u00a0complained that their own protests were disrupting the community\u00a0to justify its calls to shut down a clinic. Sometimes the protests are successful, which means delayed care for patients.\nSince the 1990s, according to the National Abortion Federation, 11 people affiliated with abortion provision have been murdered by anti-choice \u201cactivists.\u201d In addition to successful assassinations of abortion providers, there have been 26 attempted murders and hundreds of bombings, arsons and acid attacks on these health care workers. Clinic vandalism, trespassing and burglaries are commonplace. In Mississippi, a clinic\u2019s surveillance cameras were destroyed. In Montana, a clinic\u2019s office was totally destroyed using iodine and a hammer. And in Cleveland, a clinic\u2019s windows were smashed and their fences were removed.\nAccording to the NAF, protests at clinics doubled\u00a0in 2016 from the previous year. Violent attacks fell off from one year to the next, but\u00a02015 was unusually high. After anti-abortion activists released doctored videos of Planned Parenthood, a\u00a0domestic terrorist attacked a Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood; three people killed and nine were wounded. No one should have to fear for their life just to go to work and provide health care.\nEven those who are familiar with anti-choice vandalism and clinic attacks may be unaware of recent digital innovations in anti-abortion interference.\nWhen I returned home from the Women\u2019s March Convention, I logged on to my social media accounts to find that the same woman who approached me had found my private Facebook profile and Twitter account. She\u2019d sent a message offering to be my friend in secret, to pray for me and to help me find alternative employment. I saw that several other anti-abortion activists had written about the panel using my full name and reporting where I worked. They made assumptions about my life, misquoted things I said, and projected their emotions about their own abortion clinic work onto me. I felt violated.\nThings escalated when one of the clinic protesters approached me in the parking lot at work as I got out of my car. She said she\u2019d heard me speak on the panel. I was floored. They\u2019d stalked me on social media, written about me and now they had followed me to my workplace! As abortion clinic staff, we get used to the white noise of protesters outside; it\u2019s a workplace hazard. It\u2019s jarring, but being followed and approached like that\u00a0felt completely different and so much more dangerous because this person knew so much about my personal life.\nStill, I worry about my patients\u2019 feelings more than my own. The protesting really gets to a lot of patients, and some come into the clinic in tears and very inconsolable. Some are confused because the protesters have pretended to be staff at the clinic. A few are deterred from entering the clinic because they\u2019re afraid the protesters will physically hurt them as they walk by. \nProtesters sometimes climb the fence, or jump in front of cars and try to shove their propaganda in the windows. Antis use technology like geofencing\u00a0to swarm a clinic perimeter and cause anyone inside, including patients in the clinic waiting room, to see\u00a0ads for anti-abortion content\u00a0when they scroll through Facebook.\nHarassment can be worse when the patient is a person of color. When they see me, a black woman, entering the clinic, they yell things like \u201cBlack lives matter, black genocide, don\u2019t kill your black babies!\u201d For all their purported concern about \u201csaving\u201d black lives from\u00a0abortion, they have very little to say about the countless black people who have lost their lives at the hands of law enforcement. Anti-choice activists are known for hijacking conversations about police brutality, tweeting the hashtag #unbornlivesmatter whenever #BlackLivesMatter starts to trend, completely ignoring the life that was lost at the hands of police. One prominent anti-choice group published a piece telling people not to support the movement for black lives.\nSo my response to antis is simply, \u201cTrust black women!\u201d Black women experience disproportionately high rates of maternal or pregnancy-related deaths. Antis don\u2019t get to pick and choose when black lives matter. We decide when to parent and how many children we want to parent, or whether motherhood is for us at all. Just like any other race of people.\nIntimidation tactics don\u2019t stop at the clinic doors.\u00a0Antis send cards and letters to the clinic, sometimes with prayers, but usually with threats. They\u2019ve sent us postcards offering as much as $25,000 for information leading to the arrest of an abortion provider. I\u2019ve received notes that said, \u201cthese abortion workers have been arrested and jailed\u201d with photos of people who have worked at abortion clinics. \u201cYou could be charged with crimes if you stay silent!\u201d these notes sometimes warn. At Halloween,\u00a0antis targeting clinic workers send cards with candy, which we don\u2019t eat out of a concern that it\u2019s been poisoned. While these actions may seem like mild annoyances no different than other kinds of junk mail, it\u2019s not funny, it\u2019s not sweet, it\u2019s not innocent.\nUnfortunately, anti-abortion terrorism isn\u2019t new.\u00a0Those of us who provide abortion care have long faced cultural stigma, threats and violence.\u200b But the more they harass us, the more I want to do this work. Their determination to keep people from accessing abortion care reminds me how vitally important our work is.\nProviding abortion care won\u2019t make you rich, popular or powerful, but for the providers who brave the protests, nothing can take away the pride of knowing at the end of the day that we\u2019ve helped someone in need. Every reassuring smile, hug and hand-squeeze we share with our patients is an unspoken reminder that women who have abortions aren\u2019t alone. Everyone loves someone who had an abortion and, as clinic workers, we make sure our patients remember that.\nCORRECTION:\u00a0An earlier version of this piece identified And Then There Were None as a group of former Planned Parenthood workers. It was founded by a former Planned Parenthood employee but does not exclusively include former Planned Parenthood workers.\nKenya is an abortion storyteller with We Testify and an abortion clinic counselor.\nThis piece is part of HuffPost\u2019s brand-new\u00a0Opinion section.
