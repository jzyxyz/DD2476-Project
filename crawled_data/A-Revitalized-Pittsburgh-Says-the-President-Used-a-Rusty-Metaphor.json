{"title": "A Revitalized Pittsburgh Says the President Used a Rusty Metaphor", "content": "PITTSBURGH \u2014 President Trump picked the wrong city as a counterpoint in announcing his plans on Thursday to pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord.\n\u201cI was elected,\u201d the president said, \u201cto represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.\u201d\nBut the president was hardly speaking about a place of domestic political strength: Although Mr. Trump carried Pennsylvania last fall, 75 percent of voters in Pittsburgh voted for Hillary Clinton.\nIn defiance of the president, city leaders vowed again on Thursday to pursue their own climate action. Pittsburgh, they point out, is the wrong metaphor anyway: The former steel hub has spent the last 30 years trying to remake its economy in precisely the mold that climate advocates envision.\nOnce among the most polluted cities in the country, Pittsburgh today is increasingly rebuilding around greener medical complexes, research universities and tech offices. In place of steel mills, the city now has its own Google outpost and test track for autonomous cars. The U.S. Steel Tower, the tallest building in town, now bears the name of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. The local renewable energy industry employs 13,000 people, according to the city.\nPittsburgh, Mayor Bill Peduto said Thursday, is an example of how environmentalism can also mean economic development. It was a very different message from the one the president delivered hours earlier at the White House, where he warned that the international climate pact would cost the American economy too much.\n\u201cTo some, Pittsburgh is still the 1975 Pittsburgh, a steel mill town based on heavy industry, still struggling through the post-Depression,\u201d said Mr. Peduto, a Democrat, when asked why he thought the president had singled out his city (particularly in light of its reliably liberal politics). \u201cI also think it\u2019s the first city they thought of that started with a \u2018P\u2019.\u201d\nEnding the day at Cappy\u2019s Cafe, a tavern he frequents in the city\u2019s Shadyside neighborhood, Mr. Peduto said he was angry enough when he heard about the president\u2019s plans to withdraw from the climate agreement. When he heard that the president had mentioned Pittsburgh, he said, he was \u201clivid.\u201d\nBy citing the city, Mr. Trump seemed to be reaching for a stereotype of a coarse industry town where workers would cheer the return of coal (and where they might also scoff at the comparison to Paris). But many are no longer waiting for old industry to return. And Pittsburgh has joined with international cities, Paris included, to commit to reducing its own emissions.\nIf anything, the city today stands to be affected more by Mr. Trump\u2019s threats to repeal the Affordable Care Act than by his promises to revive the steel and coal industries.\n\u201cThe economy looks more like Boston than it does Gary, Ind.,\u201d said George Fechter, who was chief executive of the McGowan Center for Artificial Organ Development at the University of Pittsburgh. He called the president\u2019s comments \u201cabsolutely outrageous,\u201d adding \u201che doesn\u2019t represent the people of Pittsburgh.\u201d\nIn remaking itself, Pittsburgh has benefited from resources that a struggling city like Detroit, for example, never had: flagship universities like Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh, which produce their own tech entrepreneurs, medical campuses and cultural events.\nPittsburgh\u2019s transformation from a steel town to a center of \u201ceds and meds\u201d has been visible even on the city\u2019s streets.\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like I watched soot come off the buildings \u2014 the buildings turned from black to beige while I lived there,\u201d said Richard Florida, an urban economist who has championed the emerging knowledge economy in cities like Pittsburgh. He taught at Carnegie Mellon and lived in the city from the late 1980s through the early 2000s. \u201cIt\u2019s not the typical down-in-the-dumps Rust Belt town. It\u2019s still in the midst of a transformation, but it looks like it has turned a corner.\u201d\nPerhaps no place has come to represent Pittsburgh\u2019s shift from heavy industry to high tech more starkly than the East Liberty neighborhood, which has seen almost unrelenting redevelopment. The neighborhood now has a Whole Foods; Pittsburgh Google moved its office here from Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s campus in 2010; and the Ace Hotel opened in an old Y.M.C.A. building in 2015.\nShashank Laxminarayan Suresh, 28, a native of India who works in the data science department at the health care provider Highmark, said he had found Pittsburgh friendly and welcoming. He lives in the city\u2019s Squirrel Hill neighborhood.\n\u201cThere is so much opportunity in the technology fields here,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople want to help you here, and I have never had anyone who was unkind to me because I am an immigrant.\u201d He added, \u201cIt\u2019s a very happening place!\u201d\nHadley Pratt, 26, works at BoXZY, a 3D printing company housed in a former Westinghouse building, once a mainstay of Pittsburgh\u2019s heavy industry. While meeting a friend for a drink at the Ace Hotel, she said Trump\u2019s picture of Pittsburgh was incomplete.\n\u201cTo me it was a big slap in the face,\u201d she said. \u201cPittsburgh is still industrial, but there\u2019s a lot of innovation here. None of it was done through Trump-type policies.\u201d If she were to give Trump a tour of the \u201creal\u201d Pittsburgh, Pratt said she\u2019d take him to \u201cindustrial areas revitalized through progressive organizations; we have that all over Pittsburgh.\u201d\nState Representative Dan B. Frankel, a Democrat who represents part of the city, used Facebook to post an old photograph of a smog-laden daytime Pittsburgh.\n\u201cTrump apparently wants to take Pittsburgh back to this,\u201d Mr. Frankel wrote. \u201cWe won\u2019t go back.\u201d\nThe city\u2019s concerns about pollution become a powerful political force around the time of the 1940 photograph that Mr. Frankel posted. In the 1940s, Mayor David L. Lawrence used an inaugural address to declare that he was \u201cconvinced that our people want clean air.\u201d An air quality ordinance was approved in 1949.\nBut even with Pittsburgh widely viewed as a place on the rise today, residents still find themselves trying to distance and disentangle their city\u2019s reputation from its past.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since the steel industry collapsed,\u201d said Sam Williamson, a labor organizer who is affiliated with the Service Employees International Union. \u201cPittsburghers have for a very long time \u2014 probably because of our early 20th-century history, which sticks in people\u2019s minds \u2014 taken very seriously the challenges of maintaining a strong economy while not destroying our environment at the same time. Those two things are not irreconcilable.\u201d\nMr. Williamson allowed that Mr. Trump\u2019s comment could have been \u201ca case of careless alliteration,\u201d but he also questioned the president\u2019s approach to environmental and economic policy.\nMichael Huber, a driver for Uber in the city, voted for Mr. Trump. If he had the president in his car, he said, he\u2019d drive him through the Fort Pitt Tunnel to catch the view of the city, and show him around Oakland where the universities are.\n\u201cDiversity in Pittsburgh is enormous,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not a coal town. We were, and we were great at it. But we\u2019re not anymore.\u201d", "date": "June 2, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/02/upshot/a-revitalized-pittsburgh-suggests-the-president-used-a-rusty-metaphor.html", "tags": "metaphor rusty pittsburgh used president city steel \u201d trump revitalized says industry"}
