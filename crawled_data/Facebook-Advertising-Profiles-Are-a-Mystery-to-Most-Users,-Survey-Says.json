{"title": "Facebook Advertising Profiles Are a Mystery to Most Users, Survey Says", "content": "The scrutiny of Facebook\u2019s collection and use of consumer data in recent years has prompted the tech giant to repeatedly defend its efforts around transparency and privacy.\nBut about three-fourths of Facebook users were unaware that the company lists their personal traits and interests for advertisers on its site, according to a study published by the Pew Research Center on Wednesday. Half of the users who looked at the Facebook page with that data \u2014 known as their \u201cAd Preferences\u201d \u2014 said they were not comfortable with the company\u2019s compiling that information. Pew conducted a nationally representative survey of 963 American adults with Facebook accounts between Sept. 4 and Oct. 1 of last year.\nWhile consumers have learned more in recent years about how they are targeted for online ads, the study suggests that many still do not know how much of their behavior is tracked, where it is compiled or even that Facebook has a page that lists all of that information. Pew focused on Facebook, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, because it \u201cplays an incredibly important role in the media ecosystem of the world,\u201d said Lee Rainie, Pew\u2019s director of internet and technology research.\n\u201cPrivacy matters to Americans \u2014 it\u2019s a classic American value \u2014 yet when they\u2019re online and doing other things, they act as if their personal information is O.K. to harvest and analyze,\u201d Mr. Rainie said in an interview. \u201cOne of the theories on this inconsistency is that Americans don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going on. The fact that 74 percent of Facebook users didn\u2019t know that these lists were maintained on them cuts to the heart of that question of where Americans are, or are not, with these systems.\u201d\nAbout 88 percent of the users had listings on their Ad Preferences page. The page says that it allows users to \u201clearn what influences the ads you see and take control over your ad experience.\u201d\n\u201cPew\u2019s findings underscore the importance of transparency and control across the entire ad industry, and the need for more consumer education around the controls we place at people\u2019s fingertips,\u201d Joe Osborne, a Facebook spokesman, said in a statement. \u201cThis year we\u2019re doing more to make our settings easier to use and hosting more in-person events on ads and privacy.\u201d\nTargeted advertising is the core of Facebook\u2019s business, which brings in more than $40 billion in revenue each year. Through all the clicking, posting and article sharing, and activity elsewhere online, Facebook builds up an ad profile for each of its users. That includes information as basic as their age and location, as well as their hobbies, political leanings, family type and more. Advertisers use that information to direct tailored messages to users.\nBut questions around how that data can be misused to manipulate people \u2014 and how much they know about its collection in the first place \u2014 have put tech companies like Facebook on the defensive. Tech companies have responded by promoting tools that they say offer transparency around their business practices, including \u201cAd Preferences\u201d and a similar product from Google called \u201cAd Settings.\u201d In December, Facebook created a temporary kiosk in Bryant Park in Manhattan to provide consumers with information about privacy and ad targeting.\nPew\u2019s survey also took a closer look at two of Facebook\u2019s more controversial user labels, which are determined by algorithms: political leanings and \u201cmulticultural affinities.\u201d (Facebook decides whether a user has an \u201caffinity\u201d for a minority group like African-American or Asian-American, which can then be used to target ads.)\nHalf of the survey\u2019s respondents were assigned a political label, while one-fifth said that they were given a multicultural affinity. Twenty-seven percent of those with a political classification said that the label was \u201cnot very or not at all accurate.\u201d With the multicultural affinities, 37 percent said that they \u201cdid not have a strong affinity or interest\u201d in the group that they were assigned.\n\u201cOne of the debates we\u2019ve seen a lot is how do we judge the performance of algorithms?\u201d Mr. Rainie said. \u201cOne line of thought in the technology community, and particularly the critics\u2019 community, is it ought to be 100 percent \u2014 if you\u2019re going to judge the way the world works, you ought to be pretty accurate. The counterargument is that the test for an algorithm is: Does it do a better job than human beings at figuring out the way the world works?\u201d", "date": "Jan. 16, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/16/business/media/facebook-advertising-transparency-users.html", "tags": "users ad pew percent profiles \u201d facebook says survey information advertising mystery \u2014"}
