{"title": "Steve Bannon Says President Cut Off Obamacare Payments To Destroy Health Law", "content": "President Donald Trump ended payments to health insurance companies serving the poorest Obamacare customers in order to deliberately destroy the health care law, former chief White House strategist Steve Bannon said.\n\u201cNot gonna make the CSR [cost-sharing reduction] payments. Gonna blow that thing up, gonna blow those [insurance] exchanges up, right?\u201d Steve Bannon, the executive chairman of the website Breitbart News, said\u00a0Saturday in a speech at the Values Voter Summit, a conservative convention in Washington, D.C.\nThe White House announced Thursday that Trump would halt the cost-sharing payments, creating further instability in the health insurance exchanges set up under Obamacare. Almost 6 million low-income Americans qualified for the subsidy when they enrolled this year in the program, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.\nTrump defended his decision to end the subsidies, claiming they were a \u201cwindfall\u201d to insurance companies.\nSeveral top Republicans disputed the president\u2019s characterization of the cost-sharing subsidies on the Sunday news talk shows.\nSen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), one of three GOP senators who voted against repealing Obamacare earlier this year, said Trump\u2019s decision to end the payments is \u201caffecting the ability of vulnerable people to receive health care right now.\u201d\n\u201cThis is not a bailout of the insurers,\u201d she said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cWhat this money is used for is to help low-income people afford their deductibles and their co-pays so that their health care is available to them.\u201d\nAsked whether Trump\u2019s decision hurt ordinary Americans, Collins said, \u201cI do believe that.\u201d\n\u201cIf they can\u2019t afford their deductibles, then their insurance is pretty much useless,\u201d Collins added.\nOhio Gov. John Kasich (R) also criticized the president\u2019s decision to end the payments.\n\u201cThese were payments to insurance companies to make sure that hardworking Americans, who don\u2019t make a lot of money, can have their copayments taken care of,\u201d Kasich said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a subsidy to do that. And what this decision is leading to are higher prices.\u201d", "date": "\n10/15/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/steve-bannon-obamacare_n_59e38e26e4b03a7be5815bd2", "tags": "bannon care steve destroy obamacare president cut \u201d trump insurance says law decision payments health"}
