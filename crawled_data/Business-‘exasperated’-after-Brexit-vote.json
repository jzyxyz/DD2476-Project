Parliament must reject no-deal and take it permanently off the table,\" he added.\nThe pound was volatile ahead of the Commons vote on Tuesday, sinking after the government's senior law officer said the legal risk of the UK being tied to EU rules after Brexit remained unchanged.\nIt regained some ground after the vote, but settled lower.\nAndrew Wilson, Europe, Middle East and Africa chief executive of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said:\n\"We expect the British pound, which has reversed last night's strength over the course of the day, to weaken further amid prolonged uncertainty.\n\"That said, ruling out of a 'no-deal' Brexit could provide some support for the currency,\" he added.", "date": "12 March 2019", "href": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47546925", "tags": "brexit no-deal \u2018 uk eu business parliament deal tariffs government vote exasperated"}
