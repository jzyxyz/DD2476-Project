{"title": "Facebook Says White Nationalist Video Doesn\u2019t Break New Policy Against White Nationalism", "content": "Facebook vowed last week to curb hateful content on its platform by extending its policies against white supremacy to cover posts that praise white nationalism and separatism.\nNow it\u2019s unclear what that new policy actually means, if anything. On Tuesday, HuffPost showed a Facebook spokesperson a video on Facebook in which prominent Canadian white nationalist Faith Goldy laments white \u201creplacement\u201d and demands that Jews and people of color repay the white European countries they\u2019ve \u201cinvaded.\u201d\u00a0\nThe spokesperson said that no policy had been broken, not even the social media giant\u2019s new policy banning the promotion or praise of white nationalism.\nIn a much-discussed move last week, Facebook had issued a statement declaring that its policies banning white supremacist ideology and hate groups weren\u2019t enough. The company said it would add \u201cpraise or support for white nationalism and white separatism\u201d to the list of things that violate its terms of service, and noted that those rules would extend to Instagram, which it owns.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t originally apply the same rationale to expressions of white nationalism and white separatism because we were thinking about broader concepts of nationalism and separatism \u2014 things like American pride and Basque separatism, which are an important part of people\u2019s identity,\u201d the company wrote in its March 27 press release.\nIn theory, the new rules would ban the propagation of white nationalist content \u2015 that is, content promoting a white-centric national identity that deems nonwhite immigrants and multiculturalism to be a threat to the \u201cwhite race.\u201d Goldy\u2019s Instagram and Facebook pages very clearly and unabashedly promote all of the above. Goldy is a self-proclaimed white nationalist who monetizes white nationalist content on these two platforms. She has also publicly recited the \u201c14 words\u201d (a white supremacist slogan) and regularly posts videos and other content from VDare, a white nationalist blog.\nBut if there was any question as to whether Goldy had violated Facebook\u2019s new rule against\u00a0\u201cshowing support for white nationalism,\u201d the video she posted on March 30 should have left no doubt. In the clip titled \u201cRACE AGAINST TIME,\u201d Goldy spends nearly five minutes railing against people of color and Jews \u2015 especially those immigrating to predominantly white countries \u2015\u00a0who she says are \u201creplacing\u201d white populations in Europe, the United States and Canada.\n\u201cThe Great White North is destined to become a majority minority country in less than a generation,\u201d she says in the video. \u201cStateside, even with President Trump at the helm, the United States is not being spared from the ongoing relentless process of population replacement. \u2026 Whites will be a minority in America in less than a generation.\u201d\nAs images of white women flash across the screen, Goldy calls on her viewers to \u201chelp us stop this race from vanishing,\u201d asking, \u201cWill you just walk away?\u201d She even appears to troll Facebook\u2019s policy, sarcastically calling herself a \u201cstaunch black nationalist\u201d in the caption of her video and featuring a photo of a woman throwing up the OK sign, here a blatant wink to white supremacists:\nGoldy\u2019s racist propaganda would seem to represent the exact kind of content that should get someone banned under the new rules. But shown the video above, the Facebook spokesperson argued that it doesn\u2019t promote or praise white nationalism. Instead, the spokesperson claimed, it offers a discussion about immigration and ethnicity statistics.\nWhen asked by HuffPost, the same spokesperson had previously declined to comment on a variety of other Goldy content that appeared to violate Facebook\u2019s terms over the past month.\nThe thing is, Goldy\u2019s content does promote white nationalism, almost exclusively. The concept of white \u201creplacement\u201d described in the video is a white nationalist talking point and conspiracy theory shared by prominent white supremacists all over the world.\nSupporters\u2019 reaction to the idea can be angry or even violent. The gunman who killed dozens of worshippers at two mosques in New Zealand last month titled his manifesto \u201cThe Great Replacement\u201d and lamented throughout that white identity is under attack. In America, the body count in the name of white supremacy grows each year.\nThis kind of rhetoric is so dangerous and inherently abhorrent that foreign white nationalists have been effectively banned from entering certain countries. Jared Taylor, an American white nationalist, was most recently barred from traveling in Europe until 2021, Media Matters reports. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Goldy reacted to that news by interviewing Taylor and promoting his views in Facebook and Instagram posts.\nGoldy has long peddled similar content on these and other platforms \u2015 including YouTube and Twitter \u2015 without much consequence. Over the past month alone, she\u2019s posted videos to Instagram and Facebook from VDare, promoted Taylor, and put up other racist content, often with the hashtag #NotAllWhiteMen.\u00a0She monetizes all of this content, asking her tens of thousands of social media followers to donate to her directly.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t need the new policy to kick off Faith Goldy \u2015 she\u2019s been posting this content for years, and it broke the old policy, too,\u201d said Evan Balgord, executive director of the Canadian Anti-Hate Network.\nFacebook has previously reacted to some hate and white nationalist groups, like the Proud Boys and Identity Evropa, by banning them and some of their members. But the company has also been slow to follow up on its own policies before, often enforcing them only\u00a0after there\u2019s mass public outcry or media attention\u00a0over a particular person or group violating the policy.\n\u201cThe litmus test was, would they remove Faith Goldy and would they do it quickly?\u201d Balgord said. \u201cIf they\u2019re unwilling to do so under their new rule, then I don\u2019t see any meaningful change.\u201d", "date": "\n04/02/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/facebook-white-nationalism-faith-goldy-video_n_5ca37bade4b0f2df8669c196", "tags": "policy break new video white \u201d nationalism facebook goldy says content nationalist"}
