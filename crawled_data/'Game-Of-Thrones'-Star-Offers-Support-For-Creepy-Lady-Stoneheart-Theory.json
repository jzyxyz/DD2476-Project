{"title": "'Game Of Thrones' Star Offers Support For Creepy Lady Stoneheart Theory", "content": "You may think you like \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d theories, but nah \u2015 Joe Dempsie likes \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d theories.\nHis character, Gendry, was the subject of a lot of posts and memes before he made his surprising return in last Sunday\u2019s episode, \u201cEastwatch.\u201d The actor told HuffPost he \u201cfueled the fire\u201d when it came to the mystery of what happened to Gendry, tweeting out things like \u201cstill rowin\u2019.\u201d\nDempsie\u00a0also told us he noticed that showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss seemed to give \u201ca couple of little nods to fan theories or things that people seem to want to happen\u201d in the Season 7 scripts.\nOne possible \u201cnod\u201d \u2015 albeit an absolutely creepy one\u00a0\u2015 was noticed by fans during Arya (Maisie Williams) and Brienne\u2019s (Gwendoline Christie) sparring match in Episode 4, \u201cThe Spoils of War.\u201d Arya convinces Brienne to participate in the fight by reminding her,\u00a0\u201cYou swore to serve both my mother\u2019s daughters.\u201d\nRight as she says this, an extra who reminded viewers of Catelyn Stark\u00a0(Michelle Fairley) walks past in the background. Some thought it could be a nod to Lady Stoneheart, the zombified version of Catelyn Stark who appears in the books but not in the show. Perhaps Lady Stoneheart is making sure Brienne keeps her vows.\nSeven hells. That shiz gives us the heebie-jeebies.\nIn the books, Stoneheart plays a role in Brienne\u2019s story as well as Gendry\u2019s. So we asked Dempsie if he thought the moment could\u2019ve been a callout \u2015 and he was into the idea.\n\u201cThey might well have done [that],\u201d the actor said. \u201cI know that is a strand of the story that is present in the books whose absence from the TV series thus far has been something people are a little bit put out by, such a cool idea essentially. As we said before, they seem to be more willing to put these little nods in, these little crowd pleasing moments into the show here and there.\u201d\nSo, was that really a nod to Stoneheart?\u00a0Maybe. Either way,\u00a0it\u2019s still fun to talk about.\nDempsie said he doesn\u2019t know for sure, but added, \u201cI think it\u2019d be great. Lady Stoneheart\u2019s an incredible character, and if we\u2019d see her at some point, that\u2019d be fantastic.\u201d\nOne of the actor\u2019s favorite theories actually has to do with a parentage mystery, but not all that R + L = J stuff. While we\u2019ve all been speculating about Jon Snow\u2019s (Kit Harington) mom, it\u2019s easy to forget that no one seems to know who Gendry\u2019s mom is, either. Because of this, there is a lot of speculation that it could, in fact, be Cersei (Lena Headey), meaning Gendry isn\u2019t a bastard after all.\n\u201cAs far as Gendry is concerned, the big unanswered question is who is his mother, and I think the Cersei theory really blows so much out of the water,\u201d Dempsie said.\nHe continued, \u201cJust because the political implications that Gendry would bring to the show and being acquainted with people that are sort of involved with this power struggle. It\u2019d be really interesting, I think, a really interesting aspect, and something that I really hope we get to explore a little bit down the line.\u201d\nTo the actor,\u00a0theories \u2015 even dead-wrong theories \u2015 are one of the things that makes \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d so great.\n\u201cThe thing about the fan theories is some are so incredibly well thought-out, but are probably wrong. This is a show where you can do that, where you can come up with a very intricate theory that works for every element of this, makes absolute sense, but is also completely wrong,\u201d said Dempsie. \u201cI think [that\u2019s]\u00a0fantastic, so long may they continue.\u201d\n\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d airs Sundays at 9 p.m. ET on HBO.\u00a0", "date": "\n08/19/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/game-of-thrones-star-offers-support-for-creepy-lady-stoneheart-theory_n_5995d107e4b0e8cc855be5e3", "tags": "support think little lady stoneheart theories \u201d dempsie theory gendry \u2015 one thrones star offers creepy"}
