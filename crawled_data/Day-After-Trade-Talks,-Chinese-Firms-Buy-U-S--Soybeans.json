{"title": "Day After Trade Talks, Chinese Firms Buy U.S. Soybeans", "content": "Chinese state-owned firms bought at least 1 million tons of American soybeans on Friday, a day after high-level bilateral talks yielded progress on a trade deal and the Chinese agreed to buy more American soybeans.\nUnited States soybean futures rallied on Friday on news of renewed demand from the world\u2019s top importer.\nBut the market\u2019s gains were restrained by worries that Chinese purchases would barely dent the huge soybean stockpiles in the United States and around the world. The looming harvest of a large soy crop in Brazil, the world\u2019s top supplier, further kept a cap on prices.\n\u201cIt certainly is good to see some concessions and more buying interest from China, but this is a concession in terms of a larger trade agreement,\u201d said Terry Linn, an analyst with the brokerage Linn & Associates in Chicago. \u201cBrazilian offers are cheaper than we are so it\u2019s just part of the negotiation.\u201d\nThe purchases by state-owned firms on Friday were believed to be destined for China\u2019s state reserves and thus immune from high import tariffs on American beans. The 25 percent tariffs, imposed last summer in retaliation for the United States\u2019 tariffs on Chinese goods, remain in place for American soy imports by commercial crushers in China.\nExports to China have plummeted during the trade dispute, as swelling supplies sent prices to near decade lows last fall. American farmers have struggled to turn a profit.\nChina has been buying most of its soybeans from Brazil.\nFriday\u2019s sales bring China\u2019s total purchases of last year\u2019s American soybean harvest to at least 6.5 million tons, a fraction of its traditional purchases of more than 30 million tons.\nAfter high-level trade talks concluded in Washington on Thursday, Vice Premier Liu He of China announced that China would buy an additional 5 million tons.", "date": "Feb. 2, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/02/business/china-us-soybeans.html", "tags": "american purchases china u.s. united buy chinese trade soybeans friday tons firms million day talks"}
