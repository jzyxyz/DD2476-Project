{"title": "How Amazon Has Made Money Off Racism And Hate", "content": "Amazon is enabling and profiting from hate groups and ideologies, according to a damning report\u00a0released on Friday.\nThe report, \u201cDelivering Hate: How Amazon\u2019s Platforms Are Used to Spread White Supremacy, Anti-Semitism, and Islamophobia,\u201d details a variety of ways that hate groups take advantage of Amazon\u2019s massive platforms and inconsistently enforced policies. Two advocacy groups \u2015 Partnership for Working Families and Action Center on Race and the Economy \u2015 compiled the study.\nWhen asked about the report, Amazon referred HuffPost to\u00a0its official guidelines, which prohibit the selling of \u201cproducts that promote or glorify hatred, violence, racial, sexual or religious intolerance or promote organizations with such views.\u201d\nBut critics say that this policy often doesn\u2019t reflect reality.\nAmazon\u2019s approximately 300 million active customers can encounter products that feature hate symbols and hateful language on Amazon Marketplace, which has allowed racist, Islamophobic, anti-LGBTQ and anti-Semitic groups to sell merchandise.\nThe report found items for sale that included a costume of a lynching victim, a hangman\u2019s noose decal, Nazi memorabilia and children\u2019s toys featuring alt-right symbol Pepe the Frog.\nAmazon users can unwittingly purchase these products without realizing that they are funding hate groups that operate on the platform.\u00a0\nSome items, like George Lincoln Rockwell\u2019s children\u2019s book The Fable of the Ducks and the Hens: A Dramatic Saga of Intrigue, Propaganda and Subversion, do not explicitly advertise their white supremacist roots. The book is described as a colorful and entertaining read \u2015 but it is actually a warning about the danger of allowing immigrants into one\u2019s country. The item description also doesn\u2019t mention that Rockwell created the American Nazi Party and coined the phrase \u201cwhite power.\u201d\n\u201cThe world of\u00a0white supremacist symbols\u00a0is not something that the average person is going to recognize,\u201d said Heidi Beirich, director of the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s Intelligence Project.\u00a0\u201cYou could have, for example, an\u00a0iron cross\u00a0or you could have obscure things that look cool but you don\u2019t realize that that\u2019s from ... a hate group.\u201d\nThe report detailed items that were active on Amazon as of last month. HuffPost found that some of the items are no longer available for purchase.\nIn 2015, third-party vendors on Amazon\u00a0generated more than $131 billion in sales, The Seattle Times reported. For a fee, Amazon handles order fulfillment and customer support for these sellers.\u00a0\nIn addition to the Marketplace, hate groups have also benefited from Amazon\u2019s status in the ebook market. As of June 2018, at least seven hate groups published content in Amazon Kindle format. These groups also use Amazon\u2019s service CreateSpace to self-publish books and sell them on the Marketplace. CreateSpace keeps 40 percent of the list price of books sold,\u00a0plus an additional charge per book, according to its website.\u00a0\nKyle Bristow\u2019s novel White Apocalypse, which claims that white people were the original Native Americans before dark-skinned people invaded, was published and distributed through CreateSpace.\nAmazon Music has also featured at least 11 bands that produce\u00a0white power or \u201chatecore\u201d music, the report alleges. The genre is a \u201cmultimillion-dollar, worldwide industry that is a primary conduit of money and young recruits to the radical right,\u201d according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.\nAlthough the Southern Poverty Law Center says it has alerted Amazon to sellers who sell hate group material, the company has not always been receptive to completely eliminating these sellers.\n\u201cSometimes it works, sometimes it doesn\u2019t,\u201d Beirich said.\nAmazon recently made headlines after social media users unearthed problematic merchandise on its platforms, including Holocaust-denying books, a racist Halloween costume\u00a0and products featuring the slogan \u201cSlavery Gets Shit Done.\u201d\n\u201cAmazon has been reactive, not proactive, in its response to use of its site by peddlers of hate,\u201d Friday\u2019s report said. \u201cAmazon has a history of responding slowly \u2014 or not at all \u2014 to public pressure on this front rather than effectively preventing hate groups from using its platforms in the first place.\u201d\nCORRECTION:\u00a0A previous version of this story indicated third-party sellers had generated $131 billion in revenue for Amazon. In fact, that figure refers to how much they\u2019d generated in their own sales.", "date": "\n07/06/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/amazon-hate-groups-racism_n_5b3f7d5be4b07b827cbfcd43", "tags": "groups platforms center hate report \u201d white money products made racism amazon"}
