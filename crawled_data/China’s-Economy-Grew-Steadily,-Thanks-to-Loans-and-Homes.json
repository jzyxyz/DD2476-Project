{"title": "China\u2019s Economy Grew Steadily, Thanks to Loans and Homes", "content": "BEIJING \u2014 China turned to a tried-and-true recipe to cook up another three months of respectable growth.\nHeavy lending by state-owned banks, brisk government spending and strong exports helped keep China\u2019s economy growing briskly and steadily. China\u2019s statistical agency said on Thursday that the economy had grown 6.8 percent in the July-to-September period, compared with the same quarter a year ago.\nPresident Xi Jinping had put heavy pressure on practically every government ministry to make sure that the economy put in a solid performance. The Chinese Communist Party\u2019s twice-a-decade congress began this week, and it\u2019s a time when the country\u2019s leaders want predictability and an image of strength.\nThe figure announced on Thursday was similar to other results from recent quarters, a trend that makes many economists doubt the reliability of China\u2019s headline economic numbers. Still other figures \u2014 including retail spending, housing sales and trade figures \u2014 suggest an economy growing steadily under the guiding hand of the government.\nChinese officials say they are working hard to control China\u2019s ballooning debt. The third quarter may not be a good example of that. Measures of credit and money supply grew faster than the economy itself in August and September, according to Chinese data.\nChina\u2019s debt has soared over the past decade as banks and other lenders, working at the urging of Beijing, turned on money spigots to fuel growth. That has led to worries about the stability of the financial system powering the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\nChinese debt accumulation had slowed in some recent quarters, suggesting that the country\u2019s leaders were getting a handle on the problem. But some Western experts are skeptical that China has really done much.\n\u201cWhile recent policies to contain financial risks have slowed the pace of debt accumulation, China has yet to achieve stabilizing debt ratios, and is farther still from outright deleveraging,\u201d Andrew Fennell, the director of sovereign ratings at Fitch Ratings, wrote in an email.\nAddressing the Communist Party Congress on Wednesday, Mr. Xi told officials, \u201cReal estate is for living in, not for speculation.\u201d\nPlenty of people in China apparently feel otherwise. Surging prices in cities like Beijing and Shanghai have led some consumers to feel prosperous but have raised concerns about housing affordability and the potential for sudden drops. Chinese officials have worked in recent months to limit housing-related financing in the biggest cities, among other steps to stop the surge.\nIt is not just housing. A strong increase in fixed-asset investment last month reaffirmed the central importance of construction that includes roads, bridges and other infrastructure. Considerable building has come from local governments, which contributed heavily to China\u2019s current hefty debt load.\nZhou Xiaochuan, the long-serving governor of the central bank, warned in a speech in Washington on Sunday that a large chunk of the debt accumulated by Chinese state-owned enterprises might actually represent disguised borrowing by local governments.\n\u201cChinese local governments borrowed money from various financing platforms, which caused relatively too much debt,\u201d he said.\nChina can thank the world for some of its third-quarter performance. Its exports grew at a healthy pace as a global economic recovery improved demand for Chinese-made goods.\nOf course, China\u2019s economic success is partly built on exports. Yet China can no longer compete on costs against cheaper countries as its workers demand more. China is trying to shift to manufacturing more valuable products, which would help it develop its economy and nurture a new generation of more sophisticated, technically adept workers.\nChina also bought up more of the world\u2019s products during the quarter. Its imports grew faster than exports, thanks in part to China\u2019s stronger currency, which gives consumers more firepower when purchasing things from abroad. That also signals that many of China\u2019s consumers feel comfortable spending money.", "date": "Oct. 18, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/business/china-economy-gdp.html", "tags": "debt thanks china loans beijing economy government chinese money exports steadily grew recent homes \u2014"}
