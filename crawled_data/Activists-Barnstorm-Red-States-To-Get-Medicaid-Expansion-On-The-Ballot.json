{"title": "Activists Barnstorm Red States To Get Medicaid Expansion On The Ballot", "content": "Two guys from the tiny town of Sandpoint, Idaho, are trying to do what their political leaders won\u2019t: Provide health coverage to tens of thousands of low-income Idahoans.\nThrough a political action committee they founded called Reclaim Idaho, Luke Mayville and Garrett Strizich, both 32, are traveling the state collecting signatures to put the question of whether to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act before the voters.\n\u201cIf I can, I want to make a difference where I grew up, because where I grew up has been overtaken by similar kinds of politics that seem to be taking over the country,\u201d Mayville told HuffPost. \u201cSo I want to do something to push back against that.\u201d \nThe Idaho effort is one of several in conservative-leaning states seeking to duplicate what activists in Maine achieved last November through a ballot initiative to expand Medicaid in that state. \nAdvocates in Nebraska and Utah also are working to gather signatures to put Medicaid expansion on the ballot, and a retiree in Missouri has taken up the cause for a long-shot bid to do so as well.\nThese campaigns to expand health coverage using funding the Affordable Care Act provides come at a time when President Donald Trump and the GOP-led\u00a0Congress are busy rolling back other parts of the 2010 law and implementing changes to Medicaid policy that make it harder for low-income people to get and keep health benefits.\n\u201cMaine really motivated myself to look into the ballot route,\u201d Nebraska state Sen. Adam Morfeld said. \nHe and other Nebraska legislators have tried advancing Medicaid expansion through legislative channels for years, and are trying again this year.\nBut Morfeld said he\u2019s also working with private organizations to get the issue on the ballot this November. The Nebraska legislature consists of a single chamber and is technically nonpartisan, but Morfeld, a Democrat, is effectively in the minority.\nExpanding Medicaid could benefit 90,000 Nebraskans, Morfeld said. They have to gather signatures representing 10 percent of the state\u2019s registered voters \u2015 about 120,000 people \u2015 and submit them by July 6, according to Nebraska law.\nThe Affordable Care Act called for Medicaid to become available to anyone with an income below 133 percent of the federal poverty level, which is about $16,000 for a single person. \nA 2012 Supreme Court ruling made this policy optional for states, however, and 18 states have declined to participate. Nationwide, almost 2.5 million people who would qualify for Medicaid under this policy are uninsured, according to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.\nIn Idaho, Mayville, Strizich and his wife, Emily Strizich, are traveling around the state in a camper van the Strizichs bought last year for $1,500, which they\u2019ve decorated with the campaign\u2019s name and dubbed the \u201cMedicaid Mobile.\u201d \nMayville and Garrett Strizich each grew up in Sandpoint, a town with fewer than 8,000 residents that sits about an hour south of the Canadian border and an hour or so east of Washington state. Sandpoint is known to some as the birthplace of 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin. \nThe Strizichs live in Moscow, Idaho, where Garrett is in medical school and Emily is an occupational therapist who primarily works with low-income children with disabilities. Mayville currently resides in New York City, where he teaches political philosophy at Columbia University, and travels back to Idaho regularly.\nThey\u2019ve raised about $10,000, along with contributions of gasoline and supplies for their barnstorming campaign, mostly from the residents of their hometown, Mayville said.\nIdaho is a conservative state, but Mayville is optimistic the campaign can succeed at extending health coverage to as many as 78,000 Idahoans. \u201cOur kind of philosophy all along has been that it\u2019s actually a kind of Republican elite and activist class that is really against these programs, whereas the broader base of voters is not,\u201d he said.\nReclaim Idaho has a tough task ahead just to give voters a chance to decide. They must collect signatures from 6 percent of the state\u2019s registered voters, or about 56,000 people. They must also meet that percentage threshold in 18 of 35 state legislative districts. The deadline to submit signatures is May 1.\nMayville and the Strizichs, for now, are pretty much on their own, though they hope to gain the support of other organizations. \nThe Utah effort has been able to gather wider backing because advocates have been pushing for Medicaid expansion since the Supreme Court ruling almost six years ago, said RyLee Curtis, the campaign manager for Utah Decides Healthcare.\n\u201cOur coalition grew over the years. We got more businesses and chambers of commerce on board, and that drew the attention of our funders,\u201d Curtis said.\nOne advantage the Utah ballot push has over Idaho\u2019s is that Medicaid expansion has been the subject of a public debate in the state for several years already. Utah\u2019s state Senate passed a privatized version of Medicaid expansion in 2016 with the support of Gov. Gary Herbert (R), but the bill died in the state House. Medicaid expansion could provide coverage to an estimated 120,000 Utahns.\n\u201cYou\u2019re seeing a frustration from Utah voters in that we want to see good policies go forward, and the Utah legislature is not reflecting or acting in a way that Utah voters want to see them act on these issues,\u201d Curtis said. There hasn\u2019t been a ballot initiative presented to Utah voters since the 1990s, but there could be as many as five this November, she said.\nUtah Decides Healthcare has until April 15 to collect about 113,000 signatures, which represents 10 percent of the number of Utahns who voted in the 2016 presidential election. As in Idaho, the signatures must come from all over the state; in Utah, that means meeting the 10 percent threshold in 26 of 29 state Senate districts, Curtis said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be close, but it\u2019s not so close that we\u2019re nervous about it,\u201d she said.\nA key player in the Maine and Utah ballot campaigns will decide soon whether to join the fights in Idaho and Nebraska. The Fairness Project, a labor-backed organization that successfully promoted the Maine Medicaid initiative last year and minimum-wage-increase initiatives in five states in 2016, sees expanding health care as a priority, executive director Jonathan Schleifer said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no better way to improve people\u2019s lives,\u201d Schleifer said.\nThe Fairness Project serves as a support system for these statewide ballot initiatives, conducting public opinion research, helping with signature-gathering, providing data modeling and other means of assistance. But the group is choosy about where to devote its resources and only wants to support campaigns that will actually result in the change they\u2019re seeking.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not interested in principled wins or principled losses. We want to see the impact,\u201d Schleifer said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had early conservations in Idaho and Nebraska. We are optimistic that we\u2019re going to be able to advance Medicaid on the ballot in both of those states and we think that if we do, we will be able to expand Medicaid,\u201d Schleifer said. The Missouri effort is too much of a long shot, he said, and he doesn\u2019t expect to see ballot campaigns in any other states this year.\n\u201cAs we look at the current landscape and current political environment, progressive groups are all rightfully playing defense, holding the line fighting for immigrants, fighting for LGBTQ rights,\u201d Schleifer said. \u201cWe see a unique opportunity to go on offense.\u201d", "date": "\n02/06/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/activists-barnstorm-red-states-for-medicaid-expansion_n_5a6b95fae4b01fbbefb1bca7", "tags": "idaho barnstorm red voters ballot states medicaid \u201d activists state utah expansion get mayville"}
