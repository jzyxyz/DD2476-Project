No!\u201d Trump tweeted.\nU.S.-China trade talks are due to resume this week, with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He due to travel to Washington. That follows talks in April in Beijing that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin called \u201cproductive.\u201d\nAs recently as Friday, Trump said talks with China were going well.\nLast week, industry sources said they believed the talks were in the endgame, and Mnuchin had said he hoped that the U.S. negotiating team would soon be able to recommend a deal to Trump or tell him that one could not be reached.\nThe administration has been insisting on a mechanism to ensure that China follows through on any promises to purchase more American goods. Administration officials have said both sides are expected to launch new enforcement staffs to police the agreement.", "date": "\n05/05/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-vows-to-increase-us-tariffs-on-certain-chinese-goods_n_5ccf2e32e4b04e275d4c0eca", "tags": "goods china u-s- certain u.s. trump vows talks chinese trade tariffs deal increase"}
