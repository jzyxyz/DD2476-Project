{"title": "A Handmaid\u2019s Tale of Protest", "content": "Silent, heads bowed, the activists in crimson robes and white bonnets have been appearing at demonstrations against gender discrimination and the infringement of reproductive and civil rights.\nThe outfits are inspired by the characters in \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d by Margaret Atwood. The 1985 novel, which was made into a series on Hulu this year, tells the story of a religious coup that gives rise to a theocracy called Gilead, where women are stripped of rights and forced to bear children for the society\u2019s elite.\nSome have drawn comparisons between the show and the current political climate. In Vanity Fair, one critic explored whether it was an allegory for the Trump era. In The New Yorker, a reviewer discussed its \u201cgrotesque timeliness\u201d; another at the same publication said that already \u201cwe live in the reproductive dystopia\u201d the show presents.  \nAs symbols of a repressive patriarchy,  the crimson robes and caps \u2014 handmade, repurposed or ordered online \u2014 have become an emblem of women\u2019s solidarity and collaboration on rights issues, similar to the pink knitted hats worn during the Women\u2019s March after President Trump\u2019s inauguration.  \nHere are examples of some recent protests:\nSupporters of Planned Parenthood protested the health care bill in Washington on Tuesday. Budget analysts estimated the bill could take away access to health care in some areas from about 15 percent of women because of provisions to defund Planned Parenthood. (The bill faced opposition by some Republican senators, and a vote on the legislation was delayed.)\nOne of protesters, Elena Lipsiea, traveled from Albany by a bus provided by Planned Parenthood. She was one of about 30 women in red robes and paper bonnets who were told by the organization to stay silent with their heads bowed \u2014 a posture meant to convey oppression. \n\u201cAll of the handmaids are subjected to listen to government officials, and they don\u2019t have any kind of autonomy,\u201d she said. \u201cSo for us as protesters it was a direct way to show how we are being silenced, and the government is not listening to us, and our rights are under attack and voices are not being heard.\u201d\nMs. Lipsiea said the silent protest attracted attention. \u201cWe weren\u2019t verbally interactive, and it pushed people to ask and speak to Planned Parenthood volunteers who were around us and not in costumes,\u201d she said.\nIn Ohio on June 13, women in \u201cHandmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d costumes attended a hearing at the  Statehouse in Columbus to protest a bill that would ban the dilation and evacuation procedure, the most common abortion method in the state. The Ohio Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice said its group sat in \u201csilent solidarity against yet another proposed restriction on women\u2019s reproductive health care.\u201d \n\u201cSitting silently during this hearing really spoke volumes about how women are being disregarded in a conversation being shaped by men legislating women\u2019s bodies,\u201d Elaina Ramsey, the executive director of the coalition, said.\u201cWe were not challenged or asked to leave the hearing,\u201d she said. \u201cBut in a way it was very jarring sitting there as a participant. I definitely felt invisible. They just continued on with the proceedings.\u201d\u00a0\nIn New Hampshire on May 17, protesters appeared outside the Legislative Office Building in Concord to call for the expulsion of State Representative Robert Fisher, a Republican, after news reports of his involvement in the Reddit forum called \u201cThe Red Pill,\u201d which is known for its misogynistic content. Mr. Fisher later resigned after a committee voted to recommend the House take no action against him, The Union Leader reported.\nNARAL Pro-Choice has organized protests at the state capital in Texas against restrictive abortion laws. Heather Busby,  the group\u2019s executive director, said that her organization started using the outfits in March, when the State Senate was debating an abortion bill. \n\u201cInitially we rented red cloaks from a local shop and rush ordered white bonnets off the internet,\u201d she said. \u201cNow we have teams of seamstresses making the cloaks.\u201d\u00a0The cloaks are an effective protest prop, she said, adding: \u201cIt is very eye-catching. People are always turning and looking, and a lot of folks get it and how that relates to what is being done on the policy side in Texas.\u201d\nThis month, activists also dressed up in the costumes to protest a fund-raiser in Houston for Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican. (Separately, a group of them wearing the outfits went to see the \u201cWonder Woman\u201d movie, she said.)\nA group of Missouri women in robes and bonnets marched through Missouri\u2019s State Capitol last month as lawmakers debated a budget provision that they said would infringe on women\u2019s reproductive rights, The Kansas City Star reported.\nOn June 3, a woman in a costume participated in a \"March for Truth\" rally in Washington demanding an investigation into the role of Russia in the 2016 presidential election. \nOn June 20, the League of Women Voters demonstrated in Albany to push for improved reproductive health and contraceptive care acts.", "date": "June 30, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/30/us/handmaids-protests-abortion.html", "tags": "tale protest rights silent \u201d handmaid state bill women robes reproductive"}
