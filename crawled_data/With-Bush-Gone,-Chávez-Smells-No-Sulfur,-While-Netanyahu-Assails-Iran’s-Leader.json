{"title": "With Bush Gone, Ch\u00e1vez Smells No Sulfur, While Netanyahu Assails Iran\u2019s Leader", "content": "UNITED NATIONS \u2014 President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of Venezuela, reversing one of the more memorable lines in the annals of speeches at the United Nations General Assembly, declared Thursday that the smell of sulfur had deserted the green marble podium.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t smell of sulfur here anymore, it\u2019s gone,\u201d said a grinning Mr. Ch\u00e1vez, who was one of about 40 leaders to address the assembly. \u201cIt smells of something else \u2014 it\u2019s hope.\u201d He was referring to the address by President Obama on Wednesday. Mr. Ch\u00e1vez infamously said from the same pulpit in 2006 that it smelled like sulfur shortly after President George W. Bush had spoken, and he referred to Mr. Bush repeatedly as \u201cthe devil.\u201d\nOn Thursday, Mr. Ch\u00e1vez said Latin Americans were inclined to think the best of the new American government, but questioned its lack of action to reverse the overthrow of President Manuel Zelaya in Honduras, as well as the government\u2019s military support of the Colombian government and its continuation of the 50-year embargo against Cuba.\n\u201cIs there one Obama or is there two?\u201d Mr. Ch\u00e1vez said, using variations of the line several times throughout his rambling, 60-minute speech, well over the 15-minute limit. \u201cLet us hope that the one we heard yesterday will prevail.\u201d Asked about his remark at a rowdy news conference afterward, Mr. Ch\u00e1vez insisted that he was not denigrating Mr. Obama. \u201cI don\u2019t want to attack him personally,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say he is a fake.\u201d\nIn an address to the General Assembly earlier in the day, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel heatedly denounced President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran for frequently rejecting the Holocaust as a historical fact. Mr. Netanyahu also spent considerable time denying that Israel had committed war crimes during its three-week military attack on Gaza last winter, as it was recently accused of doing in a report by a fact-finding mission from the Human Rights Council.\nMr. Netanyahu began by waving a German document from World War II, the minutes of a meeting in which the Nazis planned the system of concentration camps used to kill people, primarily Jews. \u201cIs this a lie?\u201d he said, using the line repeatedly as he gave many other examples, including a list of his wife\u2019s relatives who were exterminated.\nMr. Netanyahu said it was dangerous for United Nations members to ignore Mr. Ahmadinejad\u2019s repeated attacks on Israel and his anti-Semitic outbursts. \u201cHistory has shown us time and again that what starts with attacks on the Jews eventually ends up engulfing many others,\u201d he said.", "date": "SEPT. 24, 2009SEPT. 24, 2009SEPT. 24, 2009", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/25/world/25nations.html", "tags": "bush sulfur iran \u201c smells united ch\u00e1vez gone one nations netanyahu assails leader said"}
