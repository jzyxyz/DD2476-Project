{"title": "After a Cyberattack, Germany Fears Election Disruption", "content": "BERLIN \u2014 After hackers infiltrated the German Parliament\u2019s computer network in May 2015, it took nearly a year before the country\u2019s intelligence agency concluded that the attack was most likely the work of their Russian counterparts.\nLast week, when 900,000 Germans lost access to internet and telephone services, it took a matter of hours before politicians began pointing fingers at Moscow.\nBerlin is now concerned that Germany will become the next focus of Moscow\u2019s campaign to destabilize Western democracies as national elections approach next year.\nThose fears intensified after the Obama administration accused the Russian government of attacking Democratic Party emails during the American presidential campaign.\nThe increasing dissemination of false news, disinformation and propaganda during the American campaign and before Italy\u2019s referendum last weekend has added a related layer of worry about the potential to corrupt public debate and democratic processes.\nHans-Georg Maassen, the head of Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence agency, warned in an interview on Thursday of \u201cgrowing evidence for attempts to influence the federal election next year.\u201d\nHis agency has seen an increase in \u201caggressive cyberespionage\u201d targeting German politicians, he said.\nIf the advent of the personal computer helped undermine a closed Soviet system that could not compete in an information age, then exploiting the vulnerabilities of the internet and social media may be Russia\u2019s revenge.\nIntelligence and other officials can now point to a growing string of campaigns of disinformation, hacked computer networks and leaked emails fitting a pattern that traces a murky route back to Moscow.\nThe aim, they say, is to undercut liberal opponents of Moscow, destabilize political systems and undermine democratic processes across the European Union and in NATO member countries, while supporting anti-European forces.\n\u201cBased on the prevailing Russian strategy of hybrid influence and destabilization, which we have observed over time and for which we have facts, the government, officials and some political parties have become sensitized to this form of conflict,\u201d said Wilfried Jilge, an expert on Ukraine and Eastern Europe with the German Council on Foreign Relations.\n\u201cSuch suspicions are the result of observation and experience over the past year and a half,\u201d Mr. Jilge said.\nMany of the efforts seem intended to tilt elections in a direction preferred by Moscow or to undercut certain leaders.\nThat was presumably the motivation for hacking the Democratic National Committee and leaking emails that embarrassed Hillary Clinton, who long had an antagonistic relationship with the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin.\nOn the other hand, her challenger, the eventual winner, Donald J. Trump, was effusive in his praise for the Russian leader.\nFalse news, also linked to Russia, was widely disseminated in Italy by opponents of the push by Prime Minister Matteo Renzi for constitutional changes. Many of those opponents are much closer to Moscow than to Mr. Renzi, who lost and has now resigned.\nGermans have not been immune to such disinformation, either.\nIn January, a news article that said a 13-year-old Russian-German girl had been kidnapped and raped by migrants in Germany spread quickly on Russian-language news channels.\nOutrage over a supposed cover-up of the abuse drew members of Germany\u2019s Russian-speaking minority into the streets across the country, shocking German politicians.\nGerman police officials later proved that the events never took place. But the damage was already done, and the false report fed opposition to Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s decision to open the doors to nearly a million refugees.\nAs for Moscow\u2019s motivations in Germany, Eberhard Schneider, a professor of political science at the University of Siegen, has observed Russia\u2019s propaganda tactics since the days of the Cold War.\nMs. Merkel, he noted, was one of the strongest supporters of the sanctions against Russia for its annexation of Crimea and the war in eastern Ukraine. Mr. Putin has a strong incentive to undermine her.\n\u201cGermany is the most important power in the European Union,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you can harm Germany and prevent that Merkel has a good outcome in the next election, that is in his interest.\u201d\nThe disruption at Deutsche Telekom, which began on Nov. 27, set off a fresh round of alarm over potential Russian meddling and the vulnerability of Germany\u2019s computer networks, which could be disrupted or hacked during an election.\nA day after the breach, Bruno Kahl, head of the Germany\u2019s foreign intelligence service, raised the prospect of evidence linking Russia to interference in the United States election campaign and warned that Germany could be next.\n\u201cIt is known that cyberattacks take place which have no other purpose than to provoke political uncertainty,\u201d he told the newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung.\n\u201cThese attempts to interfere focus on Europe, and on Germany especially,\u201d Mr. Kahl said. \u201cA kind of pressure is being exercised on public discourse and democracy here, which is unacceptable.\u201d\nInvestigations into the incident later blamed links to \u201ccriminal organizations,\u201d though neither Deutsche Telekom nor the government disclosed any concrete link to Moscow.\nObservers like Mr. Jilge of the Council on Foreign Relations say that caution is prudent in assigning blame, but that suspicion of Moscow is warranted given the accumulating pattern.\n\u201cThe fact that hackers appeared to have carried out this attack does not automatically mean that they are linked to Russia,\u201d he said of the Deutsche Telekom attack.\n\u201cBut if we look at the target and the timing, and know that such influence and disinformation is part of the Russian approach, then it is not surprising that some would seek to address this issue,\u201d he said.\nAsked about the Deutsche Telekom disruption, Ms. Merkel said she did not know who was responsible, but she also mentioned Russia.\n\u201cI will simply say, such cyberattacks, or hybrid conflicts as they are known in Russian doctrine, are now part of daily life and we must learn to cope with them. We must inform people a lot on this point,\u201d the chancellor told reporters last week.\n\u201cWe cannot allow ourselves to be unsettled by this,\u201d Ms. Merkel said. \u201cWe must simply know that this exists and learn to live with it.\u201d\nBoth Deutsche Telekom and the government\u2019s Office of Information Security said a strain of the Mirai malware, which seeks to embed itself in devices connected to the internet, appeared to have caused the disruption.\nMirai was the same malware used in an attack in the United States in October that brought down websites for Twitter, Netflix, Spotify, Airbnb, SoundCloud and The New York Times, among others.\nIn Germany, the malware apparently succeeded only in knocking out the routers and disrupting internet connections.\n\u201cAccording to our analysis, the objective of the attack is to install malware on the routers to add them to a botnet \u2014 meaning they could be used as the remote-controlled infrastructure for future attacks,\u201d Deutsche Telekom later said in a statement.\nThe company pledged to focus on improving its network security to render it better able to resist any form of attack.\nThe speed with which officials began to suspect Russia was a stark contrast to 2015, when hackers used a phishing tactic, using a fake email, to penetrate computers in Germany\u2019s lower house of Parliament.\nOnly this past May did Mr. Maassen\u2019s domestic intelligence agency confirm suspicions that Russian intelligence was behind the attack. Finally, in October, it issued a broad warning.\n\u201cGerman parties or politicians,\u201d it cautioned, \u201ccould fall into the focus of Russian cyberespionage campaigns and operations.\u201d", "date": "Dec. 8, 2016", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/08/world/europe/germany-russia-hacking.html", "tags": "intelligence election attack fears germany russian german disruption \u201d moscow russia cyberattack"}
