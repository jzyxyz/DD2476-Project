CNN reported hours later that a whistleblower claimed Pruitt kept a secret calendar to hide some controversial meetings. And the news network, citing three people familiar with the matter, later noted that Pruitt had asked President Donald Trump to fire Attorney General Jeff Sessions in the spring and put him in charge of the Justice Department instead.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Ingraham has taken aim at the EPA chief. Following initial reports last month about Pruitt soliciting his aide\u2019s help in finding his wife a job, the Fox News host said his \u201cbad judgment\u201d was hurting the president.\n\u201cGOTTA GO,\u201d she tweeted at the time.\nOther prominent conservatives have begun to turn against the man, who has\u00a0 retained Trump\u2019s strong support even in the midst of more than a dozen federal investigations into spending habits and potential ethical lapses. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) suggested last month that his fellow Oklahoman\u00a0should consider leaving his job if he couldn\u2019t break away from the scandals, although he later clarified that he wasn\u2019t calling on Pruitt to resign.\nOther lawmakers, including Iowa\u2019s two Republican senators, Charles Grassley and Joni Ernst, have\u00a0lambasted the EPA chief.\n\u201c[Pruitt] is about as swampy as you get here in Washington, D.C.,\u201d Ernst said at an energy policy forum in early June. \u201cAnd if the president wants to drain the swamp, he needs to take a look at his own Cabinet.\u201d", "date": "\n07/03/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/laura-ingraham-scott-pruitt_n_5b3c1425e4b07b827cbbeb55", "tags": "fire fox \u2018 job news later host laura urges epa \u201d trump scott pruitt- swamp ingraham pruitt"}
