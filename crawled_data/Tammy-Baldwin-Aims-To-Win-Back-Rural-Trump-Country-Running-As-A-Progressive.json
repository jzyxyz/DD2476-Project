{"title": "Tammy Baldwin Aims To Win Back Rural Trump Country Running As A Progressive", "content": "STOCKHOLM, Wis. \u2015 On a cold, icy day in February, a couple dozen people were tucked into the Stockholm Pie and General Store, the heart of this tiny village along the Mississippi River. The gathering was actually sizable, considering the population of Stockholm is just 66.\nStockholm is right in Donald Trump country. Pepin County went for Trump by a solid 25 points in the last election, the first time it backed a Republican presidential candidate since 1972.\u00a0\nBut Pepin County also voted for Democrat Tammy Baldwin by 3 percentage points, when she ran for Wisconsin\u2019s open U.S. Senate seat in 2012. So for now, Pepin is also Baldwin territory, and the people who turned out on Presidents Day were there to meet with her and figure out how they can help her get re-elected in November.\u00a0\nPepin is one of 13 unusual counties in Wisconsin that voted for Trump and Sen. Ron Johnson (R) in 2016; President Barack Obama in both 2008 and 2012; Gov. Scott Walker (R) in 2010, 2012 and 2014; and Baldwin in 2012.\u00a0More than any other place in the state, they have gone back and forth between parties in recent years.\nPepin County and other rural areas in the western part of Wisconsin may not seem like fertile land for one of the Senate\u2019s most liberal members. But they\u2019re key to Baldwin\u2019s re-election strategy this year.\u00a0\nTony Bowe, a dairy farmer in Chippewa Falls, is the type of voter Baldwin needs. Bowe voted for Trump, but he said he\u2019s also backing Baldwin, who has visited his farm in the past.\u00a0\n\u201cI think she\u2019s been working real well, especially trying to get the Dairy Pride Act passed through,\u201d Bowe said after a roundtable discussion on dairy farming in Altoona with Baldwin.\u00a0\nBowe, who said he backed Trump \u201cbecause the Democrats didn\u2019t have a good candidate,\u201d chuckled when asked how he thinks the president is doing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say,\u201d he said. \u201cOne day he\u2019s one way, the next day he\u2019s the other way.\u201d\nBaldwin is not like most of her Democratic Senate colleagues who are up for re-election from states that went to Trump and are known as\u00a0moderate or conservative Democrats.\u00a0\nThe site FiveThirtyEight, which tracks how often members of Congress vote with Trump, found that Baldwin is near the\u00a0bottom\u00a0\u2015 right along with Democratic senators from significantly bluer states such as Massachusetts, New York and California.\u00a0\nSo when Trump was looking for Senate Democrats from states he carried to potentially cross the aisle and back the tax bill, he wasn\u2019t looking toward Baldwin.\n\u201cIf your solutions are progressive solutions, I think that\u2019s OK,\u201d Baldwin told HuffPost in an interview.\u00a0\nWisconsinites in the western part of the state who like Baldwin, however, rarely mentioned her progressive bonafides when they were naming reasons they support her. Over and over, they said she\u2019s responsive and willing to work with others. She is, in other words, typically Midwestern nice. (Being nice is so prized that one woman at the Stockholm meet-and-greet objected to the term \u201cMinnesota nice,\u201d saying that state shouldn\u2019t get to own the quality.)\n\u201cHer reaching out across the aisle to work on bills is really important...because that shows she\u2019s hopefully able to bridge that divide,\u201d said Todd Macklem, a teacher in Cameron who attended a gathering of local Democrats and grassroots activists for Baldwin in Rice Lake Monday night.\u00a0\nMany of the issues that Baldwin emphasizes when she\u2019s back home aren\u2019t traditionally partisan either. With the dairy farmers in Altoona, talk centered around her Dairy Pride Act \u2015 which would bar competitive products like almond and soy milk from being labeled \u201cmilk\u201d \u2015 and an amendment she successfully included in the recent budget deal that provides help for dairy farmers.\nShe and her staff also promote\u00a0her\u00a0\u201cBuy America\u201d legislation\u00a0that would require the federal government to use U.S. manufacturers for certain public projects. Trump has said\u00a0he backs this idea, lending some bipartisan bonafides to Baldwin\u2019s bill \u2015 but the senator is always quick to note her position has nothing to do with the president.\n\u201cI have worked on \u2018Buy America\u2019 since back when Donald Trump ran beauty pageants,\u201d Baldwin said to the crowd at Rice Lake.\u00a0\nBaldwin told HuffPost she thought it was \u201cpretty great\u201d that Trump touted the legislation, which she told the president about when she first met him. But she\u2019s skeptical anything more will happen on his side.\u00a0\n\u201cAgain, I\u2019m willing to sit down with anyone who wants to solve problems. But he\u2019s a lot of words and no action,\u201d she told HuffPost. \u201cHe\u2019s never taken a follow-up of calling [Republican congressional leaders] Mitch McConnell or Paul Ryan and saying, let\u2019s work together on getting this through. Then his infrastructure plan came out with no mention of Buy America, which is horrifying to me.\u201d\nIt isn\u2019t all local, nonpartisan issues. She often stresses the importance of Obamacare and criticizes the recent Republican tax law.\nBaldwin said she has no problem criticizing Trump. But she isn\u2019t making him a focus of her campaign, and she\u2019s not bringing him up every chance she gets. Indeed, during her three-stop swing through western Wisconsin last week, she mentioned Trump only once or twice by name, although she referenced \u201cthe president\u201d a few other times. For one of the most liberal members of the Senate, Baldwin hardly talked fiery resistance rhetoric all day long.\n\u201cI\u2019m not afraid to stand up to anyone who\u2019s trying to rig the system. And I\u2019m not afraid to sit down with anyone who can help come up with solutions,\u201d Baldwin said.\u00a0\nAs of now, two Republicans are duking it out in the primary to face Baldwin in November.\u00a0Leah Vukmir is a conservative member of the state Senate who has won\u00a0endorsements\u00a0from powerful Wisconsin GOP politicians.\nShe\u2019s up against Kevin Nicholson, a\u00a0veteran with degrees from Ivy League universities who also presents himself as a conservative. Nicholson is, however, also the former president of the national College Democrats of America who\u00a0spoke at the 2000 Democratic National Convention. Supporters say he\u2019s a fresh face who came around to the power of conservative ideas, while\u00a0detractors say he\u2019s an opportunist\u00a0who can\u2019t be trusted.\nBut in addition to running for re-election in a state that has been trending Republican, Baldwin is up against an enormous amount of conservative spending and the political machine of the state\u2019s Republican governor, who is also on the ballot this year.\u00a0\nConservative groups have so far spent at least\u00a0$3.1 million\u00a0against Baldwin, which is more than what all the other Democratic Senate incumbents on the ballot this year have faced combined (under $550,000), according to a Center for Responsive Politics report in November.\nThose figures reflect what these groups have publicly reported to the Federal Election Commission. But the Baldwin campaign has tracked the spending on ads \u2015 which so-called dark money groups don\u2019t necessarily have to report to the FEC \u2015 and found there\u2019s even more money flowing into the state.\u00a0\nAccording to data from the Baldwin campaign, outside groups have spent $6.3 million against her. About $3.1 million of that has come from groups connected to Illinois billionaire Dick Uihlein, who is supporting Nicholson. And $3 million has come from groups affiliated with the conservative megadonors, Charles and David Koch.\u00a0\nLiberal groups, meanwhile, have spent about $3.1 million to support Baldwin.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not a fluke that there\u2019s so much money on the air now against Baldwin, one of the last remaining Democrats serving statewide.\u00a0The Koch brothers have made clear that their strategy is to go up early, to shape voters\u2019 opinions long before the election.\nBut expect this dark money to stay on the air until the end too. In 2016, when much of the GOP establishment stopped investing in the race, because it figured Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) would lose, conservative super PACs stayed on the air. Ultimately, all that money helped him pull off a surprise upset of his Democratic opponent, Russ Feingold.\u00a0\n\u201cSpecial interests have special interests, and I stand up to them,\u201d Baldwin said, on why she\u2019s facing so much conservative spending. \u201cIt sometimes defies the imagination how much change we\u2019ve seen with regard to spending on campaigns.\u201d\nRepublican ads against Baldwin initially focused on her support for Obamacare, but as that issue has receded for Republicans, they\u2019ve focused more on her opposition to the tax law and on a scandal at the Veterans Affairs\u2019 medical center in Tomah, Wisconsin, which is likely to come up more throughout the race.\nThe GOP has accused Baldwin of not acting aggressively enough to address the overprescription of opioids at the facility, where the Center for Investigative Reporting has noted there have been dozens of\u00a0suspicious deaths.\u00a0\nOne major thing Baldwin has going for her this time is the energy of the resistance on the left. Baldwin said the difference between this year and her run in 2012 is \u201cnight and day\u201d in terms of the grassroots help she\u2019s getting.\nThat energy showed its force in Wisconsin state Senate district 10. Democrat Patty Schachtner pulled off a surprise victory in a special election in this district bordering Minnesota in January,\u00a0winning by 11 percentage points.\u00a0\nThe seat was solidly red in recent years. A Republican, who left to join Walker\u2019s Cabinet, had held the state Senate seat since 2001.\u00a0Trump won the district by 17 points. Walker called Schachtner\u2019s win a \u201cwake-up call\u201d for his party.\u00a0\nSchachtner said she never expected to win. She figured that if she lost by 10 points, it would be considered a successful race.\u00a0\nShe credited her victory, in part, to the volunteers who promoted her candidacy: Groups like the Forward Action Wisconsin Network and Indivisible chapters were incredibly active. Schachtner also said she appreciated the support of Postcards to Voters \u2015 a national network of volunteers who handwrite personal postcards to voters in districts all over the country. She said people in her district who received those postcards really appreciated them.\n\u201cThat big money machine is going to be there, but it\u2019s really that grassroots network \u2015 it\u2019s really there,\u201d Schachtner said.\u00a0\nSchachtner said she knew of plenty of folks who voted for Trump; but they told her they backed her because they knew and trusted her. She didn\u2019t talk about Walker or Trump in her race.\nHer advice to Baldwin on how much to mention the president? \u201cNever.\u201d\n\u201cI think there are a group of people who voted for him just because they couldn\u2019t vote for Hillary,\u201d she added, \u201cand now they feel somewhat responsible for all the angst that\u2019s going on, and they don\u2019t want it rubbed in their face.\u201d", "date": "\n02/26/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/tammy-baldwin-progressive_n_5a8f5c33e4b01e9e56b9ed11", "tags": "country progressive rural baldwin win tammy back \u201d trump \u2015 conservative senate aims state also running"}
