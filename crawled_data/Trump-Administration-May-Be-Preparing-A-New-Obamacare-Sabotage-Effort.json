{"title": "Trump Administration May Be Preparing A New Obamacare Sabotage Effort", "content": "Another piece of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s machinery is grinding to a halt, at least for the moment, in what could be another effort to undermine the law by the Trump administration.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services announced on Saturday that it is temporarily suspending\u00a0a series of payments to insurers that flow through the ACA\u2019s \u201crisk adjustment\u201d system. HHS presented the decision as a necessary response to a recent ruling by a federal district court.\nThe Wall Street Journal had reported Friday evening that such an announcement was imminent and HHS, in its official statement, said it hoped to resolve the matter soon \u2015 first and foremost, by asking the judge to reconsider his decision.\u00a0\n\u201cWe were disappointed by the court\u2019s recent ruling,\u201d Seema Verma, Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) administrator, said. \u201cAs a result of this litigation, billions of dollars in risk adjustment payments and collections are now on hold. CMS has asked the court to reconsider its ruling, and hopes for a prompt resolution that allows CMS to prevent more adverse impacts on Americans who receive their insurance in the individual and small group markets.\u201d\u00a0\nBut some experts say the administration is handling the matter in a way that is unnecessarily slow and disruptive \u2015 and is a direct outgrowth of GOP hostility to Obamacare.\u00a0\n\u201cTrump\u2019s HHS seems to be jumping at yet another opportunity to undercut the ACA\u2019s effort to structure a fair, functioning marketplace for individual insurance,\u201d Jon Kingsdale, a former Massachusetts state health care official, told HuffPost after reading the initial reports. \u201cOn top of a half-dozen other hits to the ACA marketplace, this will add to health plans\u2019 anxieties about getting stuck with a deteriorating risk pool.\u201d\nAndy Slavitt, who oversaw the ACA while serving in the Obama administration, reacted to the initial news with a tweet that called the decision\u00a0\u201caggressive and needless sabotage\u201d of the law.\nLike so many other parts of the ACA, the risk adjustment program affects only insurers that sell to individuals and small employers.\u00a0\u00a0It calls for a series of payments to flow back and forth between insurers and government. The idea is to address the fact that, by accident or on purpose, some carriers end up with healthier enrollees while others end up with sicker ones. \nGovernment health care programs with multiple private insurers, including\u00a0Medicare Advantage,\u00a0almost always have risk adjustment schemes.\u00a0When they work properly, the insurers with the healthy customers basically send money over to the ones with the sicker customers.\nWhen the schemes do not work properly \u2015 or, in this instance, if the insurers don\u2019t get money they are expecting \u2015 then insurers that have enrolled sicker beneficiaries can end up with big losses, just as those with healthier beneficiaries could reap windfalls. \nInsurers losing money might react by finding ways to cover fewer medical bills or simply pulling out of markets altogether. They could also cite such experience as reason to raise premiums in the future.\nThe ACA\u2019s risk adjustment system has been the target of federal litigation because some insurers said it treated their plans unfairly. In one of those cases,\u00a0a federal judge in New Mexico ruled that the system is flawed \u2015 a decision, the administration says, that means the payments must stop for now.\nBut reacting to a lower court decision in that way is a highly unusual move, Nicholas Bagley, a University of Michigan law professor, told HuffPost on Saturday \u2015 although he cautioned that he hadn\u2019t seen any actual filings, so he couldn\u2019t be sure exactly what the administration was thinking or doing.\nAdministrations don\u2019t typically concede so much, so soon in the face of district court decisions, Bagley said. \u201cOtherwise, a lone judge could throw an entire agency\u2019s work into disarray,\u201d he added.\nHe noted that the administration has multiple options at its disposal, like interpreting the court decision narrowly, so that it only affects New Mexico. It could also write a so-called\u00a0interim rule\u00a0that would allow payments to proceed.\u00a0\n\u201cThey\u2019re asking the court to reconsider, which is something,\u201d Bagley said. \u201cBut there are lots of ways to limit the scope in the meantime and they\u2019ve chosen to do none of them. ... Normally, you would work a lot harder, as the federal government, to keep your program going.\u201d\nIt is not clear how long the payment suspension will last or how different parts of the administration \u2015 HHS, the White House and the Justice Department, which handles the litigation \u2015 are coordinating their actions. \nBut if the administration really does wait on the outcome of litigation, and it drags on for weeks or\u00a0months or even years, then the impact on insurers expecting to get those payments could be considerable.\n\u201cThe key thing to watch is whether the Trump administration uses the legal dispute as an excuse to cancel payments to insurers and create chaos, or instead tries to work through the legal process and make the payments as planned,\u201d Larry Levitt, senior vice president at the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, said on Twitter.\nA core goal of the ACA has been to make sure that people with serious medical problems have the same access to insurance policies, at the same prices, as those who are in relatively good health. It does so by prohibiting insurers from denying policies or charging higher premiums to people with pre-existing conditions \u2015 and by establishing a basic set of \u201cessential\u201d health benefits that all plans must include.\nBut even with those protections in place, insurers can fine-tune benefits or market their plans in ways that will alienate customers likely to run up large medical bills \u2015 and, as a result, reduce profit margins. Among the more well-known strategies are constructing networks bereft of specialists and hospitals that attract people with advanced cancer or congenital conditions. Plans can also construct formularies less appealing to patients with diabetes, schizophrenia or HIV.\nOne goal of risk adjustment is to make those strategies less attractive, because insurers who utilize them will have to give back at least some, if not all, of the extra money the efforts bring them. Eventually, in an ideal world, insurers would end up competing more on the basis of their quality of coverage \u2015 and less on their ability to mine actuarial data and manipulate plan design.\nRisk adjustment doesn\u2019t always work that well in practice. A 2015 New England Journal of Medicine\u00a0study found evidence that insurers were\u00a0\u201cusing benefit design to dissuade sicker people from choosing their plans,\u201d even with the ACA\u2019s risk adjustment program in place.\nSuspending payments that insurers were planning to get could make that problem worse in the future, by making insurers who want to provide better coverage to sicker people even more reluctant to do so.\nThe sums that go back and forth in the ACA\u2019s risk adjustment program are substantial. In 2016, the payments were equivalent to 11 percent of all the premium dollars insurers collected when selling comprehensive policies to individuals, according to federal statistics. And that is just an overall figure, with lots of variation from carrier to carrier.\nSome insurers neither pay or receive much money. But some do. In 2016, Florida Blue, the state\u2019s Blue Cross and Blue Shield affiliate, received nearly half a billion dollars in risk adjustment payments. That was equal to about 42 percent of its gross profit in the individual market,so the administration\u2019s payment stoppage is major blow (if only temporary).\nBy the same token, some insurers that expected to pay into the risk adjustment system because they had relatively healthy enrollees won\u2019t have to make the payment \u2015 for now. But because they might yet have to make the payments later, they will continue to carry the liability on their books, even as they hold onto the cash.\nThe largest insurers, which have large capital reserves, probably have the resources to deal with the disruption, David Anderson, an analyst at Duke University\u2019s Margolis Center for Health Policy, told HuffPost. But \u201csome of the smaller insurers that expected to receive risk adjustments payments may see their balance sheet worsen,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a chance that state regulators may increase their oversight of these insurers, which could lead to liquidation.\u201d\nHans Leida\u00a0of Milliman, the global actuarial firm based in Minneapolis, echoed these concerns. He told HuffPost that a long suspension in payments\u00a0\u201ccould be catastrophic for an insurer that is in a weak financial position and needs the cash. Maybe it\u2019s just a delay of [payments] that will eventually happen, and as an insurer in theory you know you will come out whole, but that assumes you have enough money to keep operating.\u201d\nShorter delays could be consequential as well, Leida said, because industry officials are already negotiating with state regulators over next year\u2019s rates. Insurers aren\u2019t supposed to adjust premiums in the future to adjust for past gains or losses, but they use past risk adjustment payments as a way to calibrate projections of who they will enroll next year.\nLeida called the dispute \u201canother headwind that we are facing in an already troubled, stormy sea.\u201d\nAnderson warned that\u00a0\u201csome insurers may decide that the ACA market is not worth the stress and walk away.\u201d But, like Leida and every other expert processing the news on Saturday, he said the consequences depend on just how quickly the administration resolves the situation.\nIf this, indeed, turns out to be an effort at sabotaging the ACA, it would hardly be the first\u00a0time. \nRepublicans at both the state and federal level have been trying to gut or kill the law since then-President Barack Obama signed it into law in 2010.\u00a0\u00a0\nOne of their most successful efforts occurred in late 2014, when, led by Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), they prevailed in demanding an end to funding for a different, though similar, program called \u201crisk corridors.\u201d This program aimed to insulate insurers from losses in the ACA\u2019s first few years, as carriers were still learning how to craft and sell plans that would work in newly reformed insurance markets.\nThat decision hit some insurers hard, and in some cases was a key factor in their eventual decisions to shut down.\nSince taking office, the Trump administration has attempted to weaken the ACA law in other ways \u2015 by, for example, cutting funds for organizations that help people enroll for coverage under Obamacare. And although the Republicans and Trump have not yet succeeded in their oft-declared goal of repealing the law outright, they did pass legislation ending the individual mandate penalty \u2015 the fine for those who don\u2019t have insurance that was designed to spur people to get coverage.\nDespite Trump\u2019s frequent boasts that he has \u201cessentially repealed\u201d the ACA, millions continue to get coverage because of it. Still, insurers across the country have said they are seeking additional rate increases because of what Trump and the Republicans have done to weaken the law.\u00a0And Saturday\u2019s halt of risk adjustment payments could further Obamacare\u2019s erosion.", "date": "\n07/07/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/obamacare-sabotage-risk-adjustment_n_5b40e39ae4b09e4a8b2d96cb", "tags": "administration may effort obamacare insurers preparing risk adjustment \u201d trump \u2015 could aca new sabotage payments"}
