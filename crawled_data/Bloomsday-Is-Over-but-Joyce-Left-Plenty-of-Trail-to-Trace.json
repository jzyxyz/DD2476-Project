{"title": "Bloomsday Is Over but Joyce Left Plenty of Trail to Trace", "content": "This year, more than most, offers plenty of excuses to celebrate the life and work of James Joyce. This January marked the 75th anniversary of his death. Bloomsday \u2013 June 16 \u2013 is the date on which his novel \u201cUlysses\u201d is set. And December is the 100th anniversary of the publication of his first novel, \u201cA Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.\u201d\nI followed Joyce\u2019s trail earlier this year, a challenge because he was always on the move. But I pared my itinerary down to Dublin, where the Joyce family house-hopped to avoid creditors; London, where he married; and Paris, where he joined fellow literary lions.\nDUBLIN\nJoyce was born in 1882, the eldest of 10 children, in Dublin and lived in as many as 20 homes during his family\u2019s downward mobility, which coincided with his childhood.\nA great place to contemplate his life in Dublin is with an overview. The James Joyce Tower and Museum on Sandycove overlooks the coast. As I stood outside the museum, beneath the flag fluttering in the strong wind, I surveyed a hill beyond the water, and felt the sea air washed over me.\nThe author in 1904 briefly stayed in the museum\u2019s tower, which is featured in the opening of \u201cUlysses,\u201d but fled it after an altercation. The museum, which opened on Bloomsday 1962, now houses a trove of Joyce memorabilia, including photos, handwritten letters and first editions of \u201cUlysses\u201d and other books.\nA few weeks after his departure from the tower, Joyce left Ireland. As I left the museum, I imagined a slim Joyce walking nimbly down the small and narrow steps down to the rocks and onto the street, running not only from the tower but from his country.\nThough Joyce essentially exiled himself from Ireland, Dublin celebrates the life of the native son who wrote about the city as both a setting and character. The James Joyce Centre on North Georges Street has three floors of information, memorabilia and documentaries of the author\u2019s life. Both the Joyce Centre and the museum at Sandycove display busts of Joyce\u2019s death mask, made two days after his death in Zurich in 1941. They also host the Joyce Circular Tour around the north inner city, which visits significant places in the author\u2019s life and work. The Dubliners Tour is a walk to locations from the \u201cThe Dubliners\u201d short story collection and Joyce\u2019s life.\nA guide named Marty Gilroy took us on the circular tour, which is not quite circular: It begins at the center and ends at James Joyce\u2019s statue on North Earl Street. There, he quoted from a letter Joyce sent to his brother Stanislaus in 1905 while he was living in Trieste: \u201cWhen you remember that Dublin has been a capital for a thousand years, that it is the \u2018second\u2019 city of the British Empire, that it is nearly three times as big as Venice, it seems strange that no artist has given it to the world.\u201d\nLONDON\nAfter living with a woman named Nora Barnacle for 27 years and having two children with her, Joyce traveled to London in 1931 to marry her to settle his family\u2019s inheritance. By then, he was famous, and though the couple tried to keep their nuptials secret, journalists followed them to their residence at 28B Campden Grove in Kensington. Joyce so disliked the place that he called it \u201cCampden Grave,\u201d Nevertheless, a blue plaque hangs at the building 28 Campden Grove, distinguishing it as an English Heritage site.\nFrom Campden Grove, you could take walks that pause at other literary heritage sites. Five minutes away is the former home of the poet Ezra Pound, Joyce\u2019s friend, at 10 Kensington Church Walk; another 10 minutes in the opposite direction is the former home of T. S. Eliot, Joyce\u2019s contemporary, at 3 Kensington Court Gardens; and about three minutes away is the home of the novelist Ford Madox Ford, at 80 Campden Hill Road.\nPARIS\nJoyce lived in the city for more than 20 years, becoming an essential part of a literary community that included Pound, Eliot, Ford, Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein and F. Scott Fitzgerald.\nIt is also the place where he finished writing \u201cUlysses\u201d and \u201cFinnegans Wake\u201d thanks to financial support from the editor Harriet Shaw Weaver and the publisher Sylvia Beach. Beach owned an English language bookstore and lending library called Shakespeare and Company, which opened in 1919 at 12, rue de l\u2019Od\u00e9on. The bookstore was closed during the German occupation of France during the Second World War and never reopened. At the old location is a plaque that says in French: \u201cIn 1922, in this house, Sylvia Beach published Ulysses by James Joyce.\u201d\nA new Shakespeare and Company bookstore is near the Seine down a small curved street and overlooks the Notre-Dame Cathedral. It was opened in 1951 and renamed in honor of Beach by George Whitman and is now run by his daughter, Sylvia Beach Whitman. It, too, has become a literary hub, with regular readings and events in addition to a cache of books for sale.\nThe H\u00f4tel Lut\u00e9tia, the last place Joyce stayed in the city, is currently under construction covered in taupe and scaffolding but is still worth a visit to see the vast architecture peering above the covering.\nJoyce completed \u201cUlysses\u201d at the French writer Valery Larbaud\u2019s apartment on 71, rue Cardinal Lemoine. Larbaud was also one of the translators of \u201cUlysses\u201d to French. A plaque at the building acknowledges its two famous residents.\nBut perhaps the best way to commune with Joyce is to open up his books. No airfare is required for that.", "date": "June 16, 2016", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/16/travel/bloomsday-james-joyce-dublin-paris-london.html", "tags": "left joyce campden dublin trail trace museum city \u201d james bloomsday plenty life ulysses"}
