{"title": "Trump Refuses to Sign G-7 Statement and Calls Trudeau \u2018Weak\u2019", "content": "QUEBEC CITY \u2014 President Trump upended two days of global economic diplomacy late Saturday, refusing to sign a joint statement with America\u2019s allies, threatening to escalate his trade war on the country\u2019s neighbors and deriding Canada\u2019s prime minister as \u201cvery dishonest and weak.\u201d\nIn a remarkable pair of acrimony-laced tweets from aboard Air Force One as he flew away from the Group of 7 summit toward a meeting with North Korea\u2019s leader, Mr. Trump lashed out at Justin Trudeau. He accused the prime minister, who hosted the seven-nation gathering, of making false statements.\nLiterally moments after Mr. Trudeau\u2019s government proudly released the joint statement, noting it had been agreed to by all seven countries, Mr. Trump blew apart the veneer of cordiality that had prevailed throughout the two days of meetings in a resort town on the banks of the St. Lawrence River.\n\u201cBased on Justin\u2019s false statements at his news conference, and the fact that Canada is charging massive Tariffs to our U.S. farmers, workers and companies, I have instructed our U.S. Reps not to endorse the Communique as we look at Tariffs on automobiles flooding the U.S. Market!\u201d Mr. Trump wrote.\nA few hours earlier, Mr. Trudeau said the seven nations had reached broad agreements on a range of economic and foreign policy goals. But he acknowledged that deep disagreements remained between Mr. Trump and the leaders of the other nations, especially on trade.\nMr. Trudeau had sought to play down personal clashes with Mr. Trump as he wrapped up the summit, calling the meeting \u201cvery successful\u201d and saying he was \u201cinspired by the discussion.\u201d But he also pledged to retaliate against the United States tariffs on steel and aluminum products in defense of Canadian workers.\nMr. Trump, who apparently saw Mr. Trudeau\u2019s news conference on television aboard Air Force One, was clearly enraged.\n\u201cPM Justin Trudeau of Canada acted so meek and mild during our @g7 meetings,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a second tweet, \u201conly to give a news conference after I left saying that, \u2018US Tariffs were kind of insulting\u2019 and he \u2018will not be pushed around.\u2019 Very dishonest & weak. Our Tariffs are in response to his of 270% on dairy!\u201d\nNot long after, John Bolton, the president\u2019s national security adviser, tweeted out a dramatic photo of Mr. Trump, arms crossed and scowling, looking defiant as the leaders of the other nations stood in a circle around him.\n\u201cJust another #G7 where other countries expect America will always be their bank,\u201d Mr. Bolton wrote as the president\u2019s plane stopped for refueling at Souda Bay on the Greek island of Crete. \u201cThe President made it clear today. No more.\u201d\nMr. Trudeau\u2019s office responded to the president\u2019s Twitter barrage with a carefully worded statement.\n\u201cWe are focused on everything we accomplished here at the summit,\u201d said Cameron Ahmad, a spokesman for Mr. Trudeau. \u201cThe prime minister said nothing he hasn\u2019t said before \u2014 both in public, and in private conversations with the President.\u201d\nThe president\u2019s outburst had been foreshadowed for days leading up to the Canada summit, with Mr. Trump and his counterparts trading sharp-edged barbs that included threats of punches and counterpunches on tariffs. President Emmanuel Macron of France accused Mr. Trump of being willing to remain isolated from the world.\nThat was followed by 48 hours of tense and often confrontational closed-door discussions between Mr. Trump and the leaders of America\u2019s closest allies \u2014 France, Britain, Canada, Japan, Italy and Germany \u2014 in the hopes of resolving a brewing trade war among friends.\nInstead, the gathering apparently served to further inflame Mr. Trump\u2019s belief that the United States is being treated unfairly by countries with which prior presidents had long ago negotiated trade agreements for the flow of goods and services.\nThe result was a slow-rolling collapse of the fragile alliances that officials at the summit \u2014 and even Mr. Trump\u2019s own White House advisers \u2014 insisted throughout the day could be maintained in the face of fundamental disagreements.\nReporters on Air Force One had been told that the United States would sign the joint statement. And minutes after the president\u2019s tweets, reporters were sent an email that had clearly been prepared earlier touting Mr. Trump\u2019s participation in the summit, complete with photos.\nEarlier in the day, before Mr. Trump left the summit, he brought up the dramatic prospect of completely eliminating tariffs on goods and services, even as he threatened to end all trade with them if they didn\u2019t stop what he said were unfair trade practices.\nMr. Trump, speaking to reporters at the end of the contentious meeting, said that eliminating all trading barriers would be \u201cthe ultimate thing.\u201d He railed about what he called \u201cridiculous and unacceptable\u201d tariffs on American goods and vowed to end them.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to stop,\u201d he said, \u201cor we\u2019ll stop trading with them. And that\u2019s a very profitable answer, if we have to do it.\u201d He added, \u201cWe\u2019re like the piggy bank that everybody\u2019s robbing \u2014 and that ends.\u201d\nThe other six leaders were defiant in the face of Mr. Trump\u2019s threats.\n\u201cI have made it very clear to the president that it is not something we relish doing, but it is something that we absolutely will do,\u201d Mr. Trudeau said. \u201cAs Canadians, we are polite, we\u2019re reasonable, but also we will not be pushed around.\u201d\nMr. Macron said the trade debates at the summit were \u201csometimes quite heated.\u201d Asked who won the tug-of-war with Trump, Mr. Macron said: \u201cThere is no winner, there are only losers when you take that strategy.\u201d\nTheresa May, the British prime minister, blasted Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs. She said she had registered \u201cour deep disappointment at the unjustified decision\u201d and that the loss of trade through tariffs would \u201cultimately make everyone poorer.\u201d\nThe president\u2019s public comments on trade Saturday echoed the complaints he made directly to the leaders from Canada, Japan and Europe in private sessions on Friday. Mr. Trump confronted several of the leaders individually, giving examples of how, in his view, each of their countries had mistreated the United States, whether it be through trade barriers or security commitments, according to a European official.\nThe president delivered a running monologue in one of the closed-door meetings, one person familiar with the discussion said. One minute, he slammed Germany for taking advantage of the United States by selling so many cars there. The next, he talked about how his grandfather was German and how much he loved Europe.\nSeveral of the leaders responded aggressively to Mr. Trump\u2019s demands \u2014 as they have repeatedly done in public \u2014 listing their own complaints about American tariffs and other trade measures, the official said. Several countries have said that they will retaliate against the United States\u2019 new steel and aluminum tariffs with increased tariffs of their own.\n\u201cIf they retaliate, they\u2019re making a mistake,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Saturday.\nMr. Trump\u2019s surprise proposal for a tariff-free G7 followed from a conversation the president had on Air Force One heading to Canada with Larry Kudlow, his national economic adviser. Mr. Kudlow, a self-described \u201clifelong free trader,\u201d wrote an op-ed article in The Washington Post on Thursday saying that he did not prefer tariffs but that Mr. Trump\u2019s actions were \u201ca wake-up call to the dangers of a broken trading system that is increasingly unfree.\u201d\nMr. Trump and Mr. Kudlow discussed the article on the plane, but the president surprised even his own team by raising the idea with the other leaders. While some observers took it as more of a talking point, a senior administration official said the president was serious about it and wanted it given serious study. Other leaders, the official said, expressed interest.\nThe official spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe closed-door discussions.\nAsked late Saturday what he told Mr. Trump about the surprise proposal for a tariff-free zone, Mr. Macron said, with a smile: \u201cBe my guest, if that\u2019s your wish.\u201d\nThroughout his remarks on Saturday, Mr. Trump repeatedly returned to his broader complaints about trade practices around the world, insisting that it was the fault of past American leaders who had agreed to deals that benefited other countries more than the United States.\nHe complained that American dairy farmers were being treated unfairly by Canada.\n\u201cThe United States pays tremendous tariffs on dairy, as an example, 270 percent,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody knows that.\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to pay anything,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy should we pay?\u201d\nThe president also said American farmers had been hurt for a long time by trade barriers that made it harder for them to sell their goods to other countries.\n\u201cYou look at our farmers,\u201d he said. \u201cFor 15 years, the graph has gone just like this: down.\u201d\n\u201cI blame our leaders,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIn fact, I congratulate the leaders of other countries for so crazily being able to make these trade deals that were so good for their country and so bad for the United States. But those days are over.\u201d\nMr. Trump said some of the other leaders he met with during the summit appeared to admit that their trade arrangements with the United States were unfair.\n\u201cA lot of these countries actually smile at me when I\u2019m talking,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the smile is, \u2018We couldn\u2019t believe we got away with it.\u2019\u201d\nThat assessment by Mr. Trump stands in contrast to the public statements by those leaders, who have repeatedly insisted that they will not accept the kinds of tariffs that Mr. Trump has imposed on their industries.\nIn addition to trade, Mr. Trump also took questions about his call for Russia to be reinstated as a member of the Group of 7 nations, despite having been expelled four years ago in the wake of the Russian annexation of Crimea.\n\u201cI would rather see Russia in the G-8 as opposed to the G-7,\u201d he said. \u201cI would say that the G8 is a more meaningful group than the G-7. Absolutely.\u201d", "date": "June 9, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/09/world/americas/donald-trump-g7-nafta.html", "tags": "calls \u2018 leaders \u201c trudeau united refuses trump statement tariffs trade weak sign"}
