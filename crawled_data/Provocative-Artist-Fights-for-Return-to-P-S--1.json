{"title": "Provocative Artist Fights for Return to P.S. 1", "content": "It\u2019s Ann Liv Young versus P.S. 1, Round 2.\nMs. Young, a provocative performance artist, was at the center of a controversy in February when the P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center abruptly cut the power in the middle of her appearance, plunging an already chaotic scene into darkness.\nNow she is planning to return to the museum, having been invited by the artist A. L. Steiner to participate in a performance-lecture addressing the February events. That appearance would be held in the temporary studio that Ms. Steiner occupies in the museum as part of the \u201cGreater New York\u201d exhibition. But on Monday a press officer for P.S. 1, April Hunt, said by e-mail that the return visit, scheduled for Sept. 5, was not happening. She would not comment further, and the museum has refused repeated interview requests.\nMs. Steiner confirmed in an e-mail that she had invited Ms. Young, with whom she has collaborated in the past, but added that \u201cthe matter is still unresolved.\u201d\nMs. Young said she believed Ms. Steiner\u2019s contract with P.S. 1 describes the studio as \u201can unregulated space,\u201d to use as she decides. \u201cWe are having an attorney look at the contract to figure out if we can legally do it,\u201d Ms. Young said. \u201cIt may be a situation where they say you can\u2019t but we can.\u201d\nIf the contract does not allow her to appear, Ms. Young said, she plans to take her performance as close to P.S. 1 as she can get: to the streets near the museum, in  Long Island City, Queens. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to give up,\u201d she said, noting that she is looking into city permits, and that she had tried to arrange a meeting with P.S. 1 officials for weeks. \u201cWorst-case scenario, they arrest people. But we don\u2019t really want anybody to get arrested, I guess. Although it would be pretty funny to watch Sherry go to jail.\u201d\nSherry is Ms. Young\u2019s outr\u00e9 persona, a trashy Southern blonde who never met a confrontation she didn\u2019t like. In February Sherry went to P.S. 1 as part of Saturday Sessions, a series dedicated to emerging performance art.\nOn the bill, which was organized by Brooklyn Is Burning, a presenter of art events around the city, Ms. Young\u2019s Sherry followed a performance by Georgia Sagri and quickly embarked on a blunt, profane monologue accompanied by masturbation, urination and an attack on Ms. Sagri\u2019s work. Ms. Sagri responded, yelling insults and according to some witness accounts had to be physically restrained; various audience members chimed in on Ms. Sagri\u2019s behalf. (Ms. Young has posted a video of the incident on her Facebook page.)\nJulia Oldham, an artist whose videos were included on the program, witnessed the incident and blogged about it the next day. She said in an interview, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t clear to me what was going on, but when those two artists started really getting into it, something was happening that was powerful.\u201d\nAnd then, with no announcement, P.S. 1\u2019s director, Klaus Biesenbach, ordered that the power in the windowless room be cut. Days later the museum released its only statement about the event: \u201cThe decision by the director of P.S. 1 to curtail the performances near the end of Saturday Sessions was made to safeguard the audience, performers and P.S. 1 staff from an escalating and potentially volatile situation. The performers\u2019 actions were not previously discussed with or planned by P.S. 1.\u201d\nThe move was surprising in part because Mr. Biesenbach is known as a champion of performance art, especially that based on the body, and P.S. 1\u2019s explanation puzzled many attendees, including Andres Bedoya, one of the Brooklyn Is Burning curators. He described P.S. 1\u2019s actions as \u201ca form of censorship.\u201d\n\u201cTurning off the power on artists and mature audience members because the institution is suddenly unwilling to deal with a performer or an event is not acceptable,\u201d Mr. Bedoya wrote in an e-mail from Bolivia, where he is on a residency. He added later, \u201cLeaving a crowd in the dark, without any explanation, is actually a more endangering measure than a protective one.\u201d\nHis fellow curator, Sarvia Jasso, disagreed with him and said she disapproved of Ms. Young\u2019s behavior. The escalating attack, among other aspects of the episode, \u201cwere absolutely antithetical to my understanding of what\u201d Brooklyn Is Burning represents. she said in an e-mail statement right after the incident in February. The two subsequently dissolved Brooklyn Is Burning.\nMr. Bedoya said he had never received an explanation from the museum. Nor did Ms. Young, who fell in the darkness, cutting her knee and spilling a bucket of her own urine on herself and several audience members. Yet Ms. Young and others consider her performance a success.\n\u201cShe plays the game well,\u201d said David Velasco, the editor of Artforum.com who was in the audience in February and has written about Ms. Young for the September issue of Artforum. \u201cShe\u2019s particularly adept at pressuring the protocols of art-making institutions. It\u2019s a form of institutional critique, but it\u2019s not one the art world is accustomed to, which might be why it\u2019s particularly effective.\u201d\nOther critics have not been as positive about Ms. Young, who has toured extensively in Europe, where major festivals have presented her work. \u201cKaren Finley has been doing basically the same thing for 30 years, only better,\u201d Andy Horwitz wrote in 2008 on Culturebot, a blog devoted to contemporary dance and theater. \u201cFor that matter Penny Arcade, Diamanda Gal\u00e1s and countless other women performers have explored these ideas \u2014 and presentations of the human body \u2014 in more intelligent, capable, insightful and artful ways.\u201d\nFor Mr. Velasco the key to Ms. Young\u2019s work lies not in the body but in her psychological manipulation of charged situations. He said he felt excited, not unsafe, during the show and compared the chain of events to Ms. Young\u2019s June appearance in a downtown Brooklyn space run by the online magazine Triple Canopy. As Ms. Young discussed a hypothetical situation in which an audience member would be hanged, Sam Frank, the magazine\u2019s deputy editor, interceded and drew the attention to himself, Mr. Velasco said. \u201cSam knows Ann Liv\u2019s work really well,\u201d he continued, adding later, \u201cI think Klaus was caught off-guard.\u201d\nWere Ms. Young to appear at P.S. 1 next month, the museum would presumably be better prepared: Ms. Young has invited both Ms. Sagri and Mr. Biesenbach to attend.\nFor now, though, the only one doing the talking is Ms. Young. And how: \u201cKlaus is lame,\u201d she said. \u201cHe needs some Sherry in his life.\u201d", "date": "AUG. 11, 2010", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/12/arts/design/12young.html", "tags": "fights p.s young audience museum return \u201d provocative performance ms. artist"}
