{"title": "As States Race to Limit Abortions, Alabama Goes Further, Seeking to Outlaw Most of Them", "content": "MONTGOMERY, Ala. \u2014 Amid a flurry of new limits on abortion being sought in states around the nation, Alabama is weighing a measure that would go further than all of them \u2014 outlawing most abortions almost entirely.\nThe effort in Alabama, where the State Senate could vote as soon as Thursday, is unfolding as Republicans, emboldened by President Trump and the shifting alignment of the Supreme Court, intensify a long-running campaign to curb abortion access.\nYet the Alabama measure is also a departure from the incremental strategy that abortion critics have often pursued: There is nothing gradual about the sweeping ban that the state\u2019s lawmakers are considering.\nAlabama\u2019s measure would effectively ban most abortions at every stage of pregnancy, from conception on, and would criminalize the procedure for doctors. A doctor could be charged with a felony, and face up to 99 years in prison, for performing an abortion in most circumstances; a doctor could risk a 10-year prison term for attempting an abortion. Some exceptions were being considered, including provisions added to the measure on Wednesday that would allow abortions in cases of rape or incest.\n\u201cThe back door hasn\u2019t worked, I\u2019ll just tell you,\u201d said Representative Rich Wingo, a Republican from Tuscaloosa County and an architect of the Alabama legislation, which the State House approved last month. \u201cOther methods haven\u2019t worked to date. This is a yes or no, up or down.\u201d\nSome measures in other states have tested the boundaries of court protections for abortion in various ways. But the expansive Alabama legislation stands in direct opposition to the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark Roe v. Wade ruling of 1973, which legalized abortion up to the point when a fetus is viable outside the womb, usually about 24 weeks into a pregnancy.\nAs with the long list of abortion limits being weighed in other places, the Alabama measure is aimed at reaching the Supreme Court, where conservatives have been buoyed by the arrival of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. Alabama Republicans say they want the court to re-examine the core issues in Roe.\nThe move stands in contrast to the approach of conservatives in some other states, who have argued that a slower, piecemeal approach, chipping away at Roe v. Wade, is more likely to find success in the courts and result in lasting legal curbs to abortion.\n\u201cOur position is just simply that the unborn child is a person, and the bill goes directly to that,\u201d Mr. Wingo said. \u201cCourts can do \u2014 and have done \u2014 many things good and bad, but we would hope and pray that they would go and that they would overturn Roe.\u201d\nThe differing tactics of abortion opponents have been on display this year, as new abortion restrictions have sped through statehouses in the South and Midwest. On Tuesday, Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia signed a so-called heartbeat bill that essentially bans abortions after six weeks of pregnancy \u2014 a time when many women do not yet know they are pregnant. Kentucky, Mississippi and Ohio have passed similar laws this year, and legislators in South Carolina and Tennessee considered comparable restrictions.\nOther states have taken more limited steps. Arkansas reduced by two weeks the time frame in which a woman can have an abortion legally. Missouri legislators have been considering an array of new limits.\n\u201cThis legislative session could turn out to be the most harmful for women\u2019s health in decades,\u201d said Leana Wen, president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America.\nThe proposal in Alabama, where voters amended the state Constitution last year to declare that the \u201cpublic policy of this state is to recognize and support the sanctity of unborn life and the rights of unborn children, including the right to life,\u201d is the latest far-reaching measure with a reasonable prospect of passing.\nOn Wednesday, a committee of the State Senate sent the measure on to the full Senate, after amending it to include exceptions for cases of rape or incest \u2014 exceptions that were not in the version of the bill the State House passed. The House version allowed an exception only in the case of a \u201cserious health risk\u201d to the mother.\nIt was not clear on Wednesday whether the House would go along with added exceptions, or whether the Senate committee\u2019s changes would imperil the legislation.\nElsewhere, abortion opponents have urged states to adopt rules like waiting periods and mandatory counseling, with the notion that some limits are better than none. \u201cMy philosophy is, you throw spaghetti up against the wall and you see what sticks,\u201d said Tom McClusky, president of March for Life Action, a private nonprofit advocacy group.\nBut in Alabama, abortion critics said that a piecemeal approach has proved inadequate. Eric Johnston, president of the Alabama Pro-Life Coalition and a lawyer who drafted much of the pending bill, said that more limited legislation in other states had failed to accomplish the central goal: to force the Supreme Court to decide whether Roe should remain binding.\n\u201cThe heartbeat bills are in many ways a waste of time, because you\u2019re going below the standard of Roe,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy not go all the way?\u201d\nSo Mr. Johnston said he sought to write what he called a \u201cclean bill,\u201d straightforward legislation intended to force federal courts to unequivocally take a side on the basic legality of abortion.\n\u201cWe avoid a lot of other issues, like morning-after pills, because that\u2019s not what we\u2019re after,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s important to address is if an unborn child is a person.\u201d\nLast month, the State House approved its version of the bill by a vote of 74-3, after more than two dozen Democrats walked out of the chamber in protest. Although Gov. Kay Ivey, a Republican, has not publicly committed to signing the legislation, Republican lawmakers said they believe she will.\nIn Alabama, a conservative state whose capital is dominated by Republicans, the number of abortion clinics has fallen to three from 13 over about the last two decades. In past years, lawmakers set a 48-hour waiting period for abortions; mandated that women receive counseling before undergoing procedures; and required minors to receive consent for an abortion from a parent or legal guardian.\nLanguage in the new measure likens abortion to the Holocaust and other 20th-century atrocities, stating that the number of legal abortions performed since the Roe decision amounted to \u201cmore than three times the number who were killed in German death camps, Chinese purges, Stalin\u2019s gulags, Cambodian killing fields, and the Rwandan genocide combined.\u201d\nCritics of the Alabama proposal have promised litigation if Governor Ivey signs it into law, regardless of the potential legal risks of revisiting the issue in the courts. Planned Parenthood has said it intends to sue to block the legislation immediately, on the ground that it would unlawfully restrict access to abortion, a right that has been reaffirmed by the courts since Roe.\nEven as some states have moved to limit abortions, other states with Democratic-leaning governments have rushed this year to fortify legal protections for the procedure. This week, Vermont took steps toward a constitutional amendment enshrining a \u201cright to personal reproductive autonomy.\u201d And in January, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York signed a measure that guaranteed a \u201cfundamental right\u201d to abortion in the state.\nStaci Fox, the Atlanta-based president and chief executive of Planned Parenthood Southeast, said that attempts to limit abortion \u2014 even those that are ultimately fought in court \u2014 have a chilling effect.\n\u201cThey are saying to women, \u2018We don\u2019t trust you to make these deeply personal decisions,\u2019\u201d Ms. Fox said. \u201cIt can be very confusing \u2014 what is real and what is not. And we\u2019ve been hearing from concerned women as these bills bubble up.\u201d\nJenna King, 27, said she was closely watching what might happen next with Alabama\u2019s proposal for a nearly complete ban. She recalled how her father, a Southern Baptist pastor, had been furious when she told him she was pregnant at 17 and wanted an abortion. Nonetheless, she said, he drove her to an abortion clinic in Birmingham, about 90 minutes away from their home.\nMs. King said she believed the procedure had given her the opportunity to graduate from college and then have a child when she felt prepared. She now has a 2-year-old son, and said she plans to attend law school in the future.\nRecalling her confrontation with her father, she said, \u201cHe had a look of disgust on his face.\u201d But she was determined.\n\u201cI told him, \u2018I\u2019m going to go to college and I\u2019m going to get on with my life,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cThank God abortion was legal when it was.\u201d", "date": "May 8, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/us/abortion-alabama-ban.html", "tags": "goes measure abortions alabama outlaw limit states \u201d abortion race state \u2014 seeking"}
