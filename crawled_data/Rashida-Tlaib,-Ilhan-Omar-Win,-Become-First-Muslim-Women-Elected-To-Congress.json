{"title": "Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar Win, Become First Muslim Women Elected To Congress", "content": "Democrats Rashida Tlaib in Michigan and Ilhan Omar in Minnesota both won their races for House seats on Tuesday, becoming the first Muslim women ever elected to Congress.\nOmar will fill the seat of Rep. Keith Ellison (D), who was the first Muslim person elected to the body and left his seat to run for state attorney general. \nAfter both facing crowded primary races, the progressive candidates were all but guaranteed to win in the general election, with Tlaib facing no Republican challengers in Michigan\u2019s 13th District, and Omar the favorite to prevail in Minnesota\u2019s solidly Democratic 5th District.\nTlaib, 42, and Omar, 37, were part of a record number of Muslim candidates who ran in 2018, and an unprecedented number of women \u2015 specifically women of color \u2015 who were nominated.\n\u201cI stand here before you tonight as your congresswoman-elect with many firsts behind my name,\u201d Omar said in her victory speech, to loud cheers and applause. \u201cThe first woman of color to represent our state in Congress, the first woman to wear a hijab, the first refugee ever elected to Congress and one of the first Muslim women elected to Congress.\u201d\n\u201cHere in Minnesota we don\u2019t only welcome immigrants,\u201d she added,\u00a0\u201cwe send them to Washington.\u201d\nTlaib and Omar are also part of a wave of progressive Democrats headed to Congress, seeking to push the party establishment further left and supporting policies like Medicare for All and a $15 minimum wage. \nThey join other women of color who made history on Tuesday \u2015 and who together will shake up the makeup of the overwhelmingly white and male halls of Congress: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez became the youngest woman elected to Congress, and Ayanna Pressley in Massachusetts the first black congresswoman in her state. \u00a0\n\u201cAlexandria, Ilhan, Ayanna. I love these names!\u201d Tlaib said at a September summit celebrating women of color in politics. \u201cYes, you\u2019re going to have to learn how to say our names.\u201d\nTlaib also became the first Palestinian-American woman elected to Congress on Tuesday. The Detroit-born mother of two first made history in 2008 as the first Muslim woman in the Michigan legislature.\n\u201cI want you to know my mom, who is from a small village in the West Bank, they\u2019re literally glued ... to the TV \u2015 my grandmother, my aunts, my uncles in Palestine \u2015 are sitting by and watching their granddaughter,\u201d the 42-year-old daughter of Palestinian immigrants\u00a0said after her win, bursting into tears.\n\u201cI want them to know as I uplift the families of the 13th Congressional District, I\u2019ll uplift them every single day being who I am as a proud Palestinian-American woman,\u201d she added, noting that for \u201cso many years\u201d Palestinians have \u201cfelt dehumanized.\u201d\nOmar \u2015 who was born in Somalia and spent four years in a refugee camp in Kenya before coming to the U.S. at age 12 \u2015 became the first Somali-American elected to Congress Tuesday. She previously made history when she was elected to the Minnesota House in 2016, becoming the nation\u2019s first Somali-American legislator.\n\u201cI hope my candidacy would allow people to have the boldness to encourage people who don\u2019t fit into [a] particular demographic to seek office,\u201d the mother of three told HuffPost that year.", "date": "\n11/06/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ilhan-omar-rashida-tlaib-win-congress-2018_n_5bc4fe8be4b055bc9478ba73", "tags": "tlaib rashida first win become omar \u201d woman \u2015 muslim ilhan elected women congress"}
