{"title": "Donald Trump, Here's What It's Really Like To Get A Late-Term Abortion", "content": "In the final presidential debate on Wednesday, October 19, Republican candidate Donald Trump displayed profound ignorance about what late-term abortion is.\n\u201cIf you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother,\u201d Trump said. \u201cJust prior to the birth of the baby.\u201d\nThat\u2019s not true, of course, but long after this election cycle ends, it\u2019s the kind of insidious myth that will linger. Someone, somewhere, will hear \u201clate-term abortion\u201d and vaguely recall a politician talking about babies being grabbed from the womb. They will think of a lie, and not the fact that abortions that happen more than halfway through a pregnancy are rare (just over 1 percent of abortions in the United States are performed at or after 21 weeks), and are typically done either because a mother\u2019s life is in danger, or because her baby has severe birth defects. The women who seek them are often in the throes of the most heartbreaking time of their lives.\nSo to set the record straight, two women \u2015 both of whom came to HuffPost via the Advocates for Youth\u2019s 1 in 3 Campaign, which works to end abortion stigma \u2015 are sharing their experiences of what it\u2019s really like to get a late-term abortion. Listen up, Donald Trump, and do better.\n* * * * *\u00a0\n\u2015 Heather, 45\n\u00a0\n* * * * *\u00a0\n\u2015 Lindsay Bubar, 34\nThese accounts have been edited and condensed.\u00a0", "date": "\n10/21/2016", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-heres-what-its-really-like-to-get-a-late-term-abortion_n_580a179ee4b02444efa2bf58", "tags": "mother really womb trump \u2015 donald late-term abortion get like baby"}
