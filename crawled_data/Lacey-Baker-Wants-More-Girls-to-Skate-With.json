{"title": "Lacey Baker Wants More Girls to Skate With", "content": "Do you get any flak from men in the skateboarding industry? Or do they think that it\u2019s time for there to be more female professional skaters? I\u2019m sure that it\u2019s out there. I don\u2019t pay a whole lot of attention to it. I know if I scroll through comments on YouTube videos of me \u2014 or of other girl skateboarders \u2014 there\u2019s always those [expletive] comments, the same rude, homophobic, sexist stuff. But the world that I\u2019ve created for myself within skateboarding \u2014 it doesn\u2019t really exist there.\nYou ride for an all-female board company, Meow. Is that a refuge for you? Yeah. Meow has such a rad little niche. Moms reach out to me on Instagram and tell me that their daughters started skating because they saw Meow Skateboards. They\u2019re, like, superpsyched that there\u2019s inspiration for young girls to be doing it. That\u2019s a whole new generation of skateboarders that otherwise may have not existed.\nI thought you were going to say all the moms started skating. I\u2019m sure some did.\nYou\u2019re also sponsored by Nike. Do you feel as if skateboarding, which will be in the 2020 Olympics, loses anything as it becomes more mainstream? No, because it\u2019s just enabling more and more people to skate. I think that\u2019s really cool. Skateboarding is reaching places where it otherwise may not have reached.\nWere you aware when you started that skateboarding was a bit of a boys\u2019 club? Not at all. I found skateboarding when I was, like, 2 years old. I mostly skated either by myself or with friends out on the cul-de-sac. When I got into high school I realized I never had any girl friends who skated. But I never really thought about that either. It just was what it was.\nYou were just skating with the people who liked to skate. I was 13 or 14 years old when I met all these other girl skaters. That became my community. Skating with dudes is fine. The way they are and the way they talk, I don\u2019t know \u2014 it\u2019s a lot of offensive language. Skating with girls was just really refreshing.\nWho were your skater heroes when you first started out? Andrew Reynolds. The first skate videos I saw were \u201cBaker 2G\u201d and \u201cBaker Bootleg.\u201d Elissa Steamer had a part in \u201cBootleg.\u201d I thought she was basically the only female street skater around. Then I saw \u201cP.J. Ladd\u2019s Wonderful, Horrible Life,\u201d and Alexis Sablone had a part in it. I was blown away; there was another girl skateboarder aside from Elissa Steamer.\nYou\u2019re an openly queer skater. You\u2019ve mentioned Brian Anderson, one of the first openly gay professional skateboarders, as an influence. He only came out in 2016, after being pro for about two decades. My experience of that is night and day compared to Brian\u2019s. A lot of girls who skate are gay or queer, so I didn\u2019t feel afraid to talk about it ever. My guy friends didn\u2019t care if I was gay or not. But I think it\u2019s more of a toxic masculinity thing that Brian experienced, where dudes, like, have to be straight.\nYou\u2019ve said in the past that you shaved your head to make a point. You felt that female skaters who tended to get coverage were longhaired blond surfer-looking chicks. Is that something you still think about? It\u2019s something that I\u2019m extremely aware of. I got sponsored when I was pretty young. Back then I had long blond hair, and I would wear baggy pants and a baggy shirt and whatever, I didn\u2019t care \u2014 I wanted to dress that way. One of my sponsors was telling me I should wear girl pants and be more feminine because it\u2019s marketable. They just wanted me to appear a certain way, and I felt like it wasn\u2019t about my skating. It was just about the way I look. But that\u2019s all changing, and that\u2019s what the industry needs because there\u2019s so many of us out there. Not every girl can relate to being super [expletive] feminine, you know what I mean?\nI assume that\u2019s not what you\u2019re thinking about when you\u2019re skating. When I\u2019m skating, I\u2019m just skating.", "date": "March 27, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/27/magazine/lacey-baker-wants-more-girls-to-skate-with.html", "tags": "like think skateboarding really lacey started way wants girl skate girls skating baker \u2014"}
