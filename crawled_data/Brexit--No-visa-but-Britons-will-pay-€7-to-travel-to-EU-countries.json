{"title": "Brexit: No visa but Britons will pay \u20ac7 to travel to EU countries", "content": "Britons will have to pay \u20ac7 (\u00a36.30) every three years to travel to EU countries, as a consequence of Brexit.\nThe European Commission has confirmed that while UK travellers will not need a visa, they will need to apply for and buy another document.\nIt is called an ETIAS (European Travel Information and Authorisation System) and although not launched yet, is expected to come into force in 2021.\nThe travel requirement is not just for the UK but for many non-EU countries.\nCitizens of EU countries - which currently includes British people - are able to travel anywhere in the EU.\nBut anyone from a non-EU country has to apply for a visa - unless they are from a special list of 61 countries, which also includes the US, Japan and Australia. \nNationals from these 61 countries can travel within the EU's Schengen zone - the area where people can travel without border checks - for up to 90 days without a visa.\nHowever, because of the migrant crisis and security concerns over terrorism, the EU has decided to bring in more controls over the countries on this special list. \nSo it is introducing the ETIAS - an electronic application form - which is Europe's version of the United States' $14 ESTA, although as the EU Commission points out, it is \"way cheaper\".\nIt is not a visa but a travel requirement for anyone on that list of 61 non-EU countries who are coming to the EU for business, tourism, medical or transit-related reasons for up to 90 days. \nThe EU says the ETIAS system will \"to strengthen security checks on those persons who travel visa-free to the EU\".\nUnder the Brexit deal, EU citizens and UK nationals will continue to be able to travel freely with a passport or identity card until the end of the transition period in 2020.\nAfter this period ends, the European Commission has offered visa-free travel for UK nationals coming to the EU for a short stay, as long as the UK offers the same in return.\nBut although they do not need a visa, UK nationals will need an ETIAS - deal or no deal.\nThe form - which the EU describes as a \"necessary and small procedural step\" - will take no more than 10 minutes and anyone between the ages of 18 and 70 must pay the fee, the EU says.\nThe details needed for the application form will include passport information as well as background questions about criminal records or medical conditions.\nMost people will find out if their application has been successful within minutes, the EU says, with more than 95% of applications approved automatically.\nApplications can also be denied or take up to four weeks to process.\nIf successful, the ETIAS will last for three years and allow an unlimited number of entries. The document will be checked by border guards when crossing the EU border. \nIt is not known what rules will apply to EU tourists coming to the UK, but according to the EU and UK's political declaration, both sides will aim to provide \"visa-free travel for short-term visits\".\nThe European Commission previously said the EU's offer of visa-free travel to the UK was \"entirely conditional upon the UK also granting reciprocal and non-discriminatory visa-free travel for all EU member states\".\nThe proposal - which will come into force on 29 March 2019 when the UK leaves the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit - must be adopted by the EU Parliament and European Council before it can come into force.\nThe UK already grants visa-free travel to nationals from 56 countries - ranging from the United States to the Maldives - allowing people to stay for a maximum of six months. But they are not allowed to work, study or settle.\nThe news could also lead to a renewed surge in applications for Irish passports by British citizens.\nCitizens of the Republic of Ireland, an EU member state, will retain visa-free travel benefits after Brexit, no matter the outcome of the UK's negotiations with the EU.\nUK residents are entitled to an Irish passport if their parents or grandparents were born in Ireland, while most Northern Ireland citizens are entitled to an Irish passport if they wish.\nEarlier in 2018, it was reported that Irish passport applications by UK citizens were booming.", "date": "14 December 2018", "href": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-46564884", "tags": "brexit european citizens uk britons eu visa countries pay travel nationals visa-free etias"}
