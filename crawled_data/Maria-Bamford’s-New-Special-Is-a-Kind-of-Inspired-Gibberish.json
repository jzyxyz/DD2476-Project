{"title": "Maria Bamford\u2019s New Special Is a Kind of Inspired Gibberish", "content": "Since her last special, the stand-up comic Maria Bamford has gotten married, and while romantic commitment is a primary theme of \u201cOld Baby,\u201d her new hourlong special released on Netflix last week, don\u2019t expect the usual jokes about how a wedding ends your sex life.\n\u201cWe have a lot of sex,\u201d she says in a smoky voice before describing her love life. \u201cA lot of fudging and wedging and lotions and potions and unguents and poultices, jams and jellies. Custards, mustards, sauces, souses, foam soups, smoothing milks.\u201d\nThis litany spins in an even more bizarre direction, concluding with Ms. Bamford shouting \u201cHammer, anvil!\u201d three times and bending down in orgasmic exhaustion.\nThis kind of inspired gibberish, which pokes fun at sex talk but is far too unhinged to be straight satire, really appeals to a certain kind of comedy nerd. Not everyone will be delighted by the unexpected use of the word \u201cunguents,\u201d but some people will be, and count me among them.\nBut while this special will be catnip for those who love the delirious absurdity of Ms. Bamford\u2019s Netflix series, \u201cLady Dynamite,\u201d it also represents a narrowing of her aesthetic, a doubling down on her quirks, occasionally at the expense of being consistently funny. It\u2019s an intimate and inward-looking hour of stand-up that wrestles with the question of who is and who should be her audience.\nIn this special, Ms. Bamford, who emerged in the alternative comedy movement at the turn of the last century, pokes fun at herself for not wanting to perform in a sports bar; imitates an audience member upset at her paucity of punch lines; and sends up the common comedian boast that you need to play for a multitude of different crowds to really develop your skills. \u201cI just did a pop-up open mike at a live birth,\u201d she says. \u201cYou know, just to be there for baby\u2019s first laugh.\u201d\nIn her last special, a dynamite set that melded formal experimentation with tightly crafted jokes, Ms. Bamford performed to an audience of only her mother and father. The warm and supportive setting seemed to embrace a stereotype of alternative comics held by club comics (although the distinction between those two camps seems less and less meaningful), namely that they prefer to perform for crowds that are just like them, what Bill Burr derisively called a \u201ccomedy womb.\u201d\nEvery fan base, including Mr. Burr\u2019s, is its own bubble, and some comics push its limits more than others. \u201cOld Baby\u201d rests comfortably inside its womb, while pointedly drawing attention to it through its form, shifting settings every few minutes through deft edits (Jessica Yu directed the special with an assured and nimble touch), from Ms. Bamford telling jokes to her husband in their house, to a bunch of old friends on a suburban street, then to strangers in a bowling alley.\nWhat\u2019s striking is that her comedy doesn\u2019t change while the context and audience does. A seasoned, virtuoso comedian, Ms. Bamford makes the case for stand-up as a personal art form that stays true to itself rather than adjusting to the crowd.\nShe has long gotten her biggest laughs from doing voices inside a joke, some of which are impressions of specific people, like her mother, though most are not. They can be caricatures of types of people or something more abstract, like an ominous growl, baritone grunt or a symphony of farting noises. One of her go-to jokes involves her shifting from a quiet tone to a holler that has a similar rhythm to Sam Kinison\u2019s scream.\nLike the greatest comedians, Ms. Bamford has a deep appreciation for funny words. Her jokes are filled with oddball phrases that are whimsical (\u201cpassing fancy\u201d) or slightly puzzling (\u201cI always wanted a clean boy\u201d). She\u2019s subtle and highly self-conscious, but no snob. She is happy to put on a pair of oversize shorts for a laugh. But even her blunt jokes are always slightly off kilter, focusing more on bizarre turns than on an explosive climax.\nSome of her best bits take the shape of an elaborate metaphor dragged out indulgently. \u201cI\u2019m going full Detroit\u201d is how she describes getting older, comparing her body to that struggling Midwestern city, with aging as seemingly inevitable as globalization. \u201cAbandoning all infrastructure. Letting my neural pathways go slack with disuse.\u201d After saying she\u2019s worried about sinking property values, she moves into the kicker: \u201cI\u2019m a good place to squat.\u201d\nMs. Bamford begins the special staring in the mirror, setting a mood of self-awareness and quiet intimacy that holds for an hour. After telling jokes to her husband, she gives him a high-five; and the special ends with him playing peekaboo, making her laugh. It\u2019s the second reference to peekaboo in the hour, and it\u2019s not the only time the fun of childhood is evoked.\nAt one point, onstage at a theater, she tries to reproduce a game she played as a child called One Big Blob, with everyone in the audience forming a human chain. It has the feel of a late-night stunt, but the execution is strained and clumsy. The friendly spectacle and inclusion of her husband in this special is endearing, but it can also move from sweet to cloying and is part of the reason this show is more likely to appeal to fans than win converts.\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with that. Stand-up comedy doesn\u2019t need to please everyone, and it\u2019s as absurd to expect it to as it is to think Wes Anderson\u2019s movies will be to everyone\u2019s taste. Indeed, you can think of Ms. Bamford as the Wes Anderson of stand-up: Both are refined artists whose meticulous and sensitive set pieces are formally daring and stubbornly committed to a distinctive aesthete\u2019s sensibility. \u201cOld Baby\u201d is her \u201cThe Darjeeling Limited.\u201d", "date": "May 9, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/09/arts/television/maria-bamfords-new-special-is-a-kind-of-inspired-gibberish.html", "tags": "maria inspired bamford stand-up comedy audience \u201d ms. jokes gibberish last new special kind"}
