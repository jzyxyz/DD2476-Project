To announce the April premiere, the network recycled shots from past seasons with an ominous, yet familiar, voiceover by Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey): \u201cWhen you play the game of thrones, you win or you die.\u201d\nText flashes between fast-moving clips: \u201cEvery battle. Every betrayal. Every risk. Every fight. Every sacrifice. Every death. All #ForTheThrone.\u201d\nSeason 8 has to address a lot of questions.\u00a0First among them: Why can\u2019t the network give us a specific date, already?\nAlthough the final season will include six extra-long episodes, HBO has already given a pilot order to one of several in-the-works prequels, set thousands of years before the plot of \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d George R.R. Martin, author of the books on which the series is based, already has a name in mind for the new show: \u201cThe Long Night.\u201d", "date": "\n11/13/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/game-of-thrones-april-2019_n_5beaf01fe4b0783e0a1cab64", "tags": "debut game network already hbo season every \u201d final says thrones april"}
