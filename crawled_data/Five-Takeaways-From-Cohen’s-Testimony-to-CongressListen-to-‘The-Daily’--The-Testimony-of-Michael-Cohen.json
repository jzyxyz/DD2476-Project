{"title": "Five Takeaways From Cohen\u2019s Testimony to CongressListen to \u2018The Daily\u2019: The Testimony of Michael Cohen", "content": "Michael D. Cohen made it personal.\nIn sworn testimony on Wednesday to the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, he painted President Trump, the man he used to revere, as a con man, a cheat and a racist.  \nHis words were blunt and salacious and outlined a vivid bill of particulars against the president of the United States.\nMr. Cohen offered new details into Trump World, namely that Mr. Trump directed him to lie about a hush money payment to Stormy Daniels, an adult film actress, and he implicated the president\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., and the chief financial officer of Mr. Trump\u2019s company, Allen Weisselberg, in the arrangement of those payments. Mr. Cohen also said that people around the president were involved in persuading Mr. Cohen to change the date he gave about when the discussions for a Moscow-based Trump Tower project ended during the 2016 presidential campaign, an assertion that one of the president\u2019s lawyers, Jay Sekulow, denounced as \u201ccompletely false.\u201d\n\u201cI have fixed things, but I am no longer your \u2018fixer,\u2019 Mr. Trump,\u201d Mr. Cohen said.\nHere are some key takeaways from Mr. Cohen\u2019s testimony.\nMr. Cohen\u2019s testimony did not provide conclusive proof that incriminates the president on possible collusion with Russia. On another matter, though \u2014 one that is the province of federal prosecutors in New York and not that of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III \u2014 Mr. Cohen\u2019s testimony and documents could prove far more damaging.\nMr. Cohen said the president had firsthand knowledge of the payment made to Ms. Daniels, just before Election Day in 2016, that were part of an effort to silence her from talking about a sexual encounter she said she had with Mr. Trump. Acting at the president\u2019s direction, he said he procured a home-equity loan to pay Ms. Daniels $130,000. But Mr. Cohen also gave the committee documentary evidence: a copy of a check dated Aug. 1, 2017, for $35,000 from Mr. Trump\u2019s personal bank account that bore Mr. Trump\u2019s signature. Mr. Cohen said the check was one of 11 installments that the president made to reimburse him. \nPerhaps more important, Mr. Cohen said that the president directed him to lie about Mr. Trump\u2019s knowledge of the payment to Ms. Daniels.\nMr. Cohen testified that Mr. Trump, on at least a half-dozen occasions in 2016, asked questions about negotiations over building a Trump Tower in Moscow. \u201cMr. Trump knew of and directed the Trump Moscow negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it,\u201d Mr. Cohen said in his opening statement.\nBut Mr. Cohen said that Mr. Trump did not explicitly instruct him to lie about the matter. Rather, as one who worked for Mr. Trump for nearly a decade, Mr. Cohen said he understood the president\u2019s directions without specific words, saying Mr. Trump spoke in \u201ccode,\u201d and he understood \u201cthe code.\u201d He added that the president\u2019s lawyers reviewed Mr. Cohen\u2019s false statements to Congress about the Moscow project.\nMr. Cohen offered just enough strands of information, though, to keep the Russia issue very much alive, and to invite additional scrutiny from congressional Democrats, possibly even involving the president\u2019s children. \u201cTo be clear, Mr. Trump knew of and directed the Trump Moscow negotiations through the campaign and lied about it,\u201d Mr. Cohen said.\nHe cited a meeting in June 2016 at Trump Tower in Manhattan with Russians who claimed to have \u201cdirt\u201d on Hillary Clinton. At the meeting, he said, were Donald Trump Jr.; Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law; and Paul Manafort, the Trump campaign chairman. Mr. Cohen also suggested that Mr. Trump knew about the meeting, something that the president has denied.\nHe added that Mr. Trump knew in advance that WikiLeaks was going to divulge thousands of emails stolen from Democrats. He said that Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime Trump adviser, told Mr. Trump that he had talked with the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, who said there would be a \u201cmassive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.\u201d\nAccording to Mr. Cohen, Mr. Trump responded, \u201cWouldn\u2019t that be great.\u201d\nThe term \u201cfixer\u201d evokes movies or novels about organized crime, men in dark coats and heavy beards who make problems go away. Mr. Cohen provided a nonfiction account of that role, which he played for Mr. Trump, a man for whom Mr. Cohen once said he would take a bullet.\nMr. Cohen explained to members of Congress the concept of \u201ccatch and kill,\u201d a method of stopping a negative article before it is published, in this case by working with the company that owns The National Enquirer. Other duties, he said, included writing threatening letters to schools, warning them against the release of Mr. Trump\u2019s academic records, and paying off a woman with compromising information about a presidential candidate.\n\u201cThat was my job,\u201d Mr. Cohen said. \u201cAlways stay on message. Always defend. It monopolized my life.\u201d\nNot content to talk only about a possible conspiracy and payoffs to Ms. Daniels, Mr. Cohen also offered a damnable assessment of Mr. Trump\u2019s character. He said that he made bigoted remarks about African-Americans in the United States and about predominantly black nations.\nHe said Mr. Trump boasted about inflating assets when it served him, and about understating values when it helped to lower his taxes. He also carried out orders from Mr. Trump to tell contractors that Mr. Trump was refusing to pay them the money owed \u201cfor their services.\u201d\nAbout avoiding Vietnam through a medical deferment, Mr. Cohen said Mr. Trump told him, \u201cYou think I\u2019m stupid? I wasn\u2019t going to Vietnam.\u201d\nMr. Cohen did offer one important piece of exculpatory information for the president. He said that despite many rumors, he knew of no tape from an elevator that showed Mr. Trump hitting his wife, Melania.\nMr. Cohen\u2019s testimony will reinforce the partisan divide over the president. Whether it will be regarded as seminal in the investigation is an open question.\nThe performance of the members of Congress, Republican and Democrat, is unlikely to leave a mark. Mr. Cohen tried to warn Republicans that they, today, were just like he once was: a supplicant to Mr. Trump. They responded by questioning why they should listen to a man convicted of lying.\nThe questions fell along party lines. Few members seemed to have done deep research to elicit new information, and the polarization of the era was on vivid display.", "date": "Feb. 27, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/us/politics/cohen-testimony.html", "tags": "congresslisten testimony \u2018 five daily president \u201d trump cohen daniels takeaways michael also"}
