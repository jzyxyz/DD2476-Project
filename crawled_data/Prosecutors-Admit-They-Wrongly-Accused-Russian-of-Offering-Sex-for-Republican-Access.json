{"title": "Prosecutors Admit They Wrongly Accused Russian of Offering Sex for Republican Access", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Federal prosecutors have admitted that they wrongly accused Maria Butina, a Russian citizen now in custody on charges of illegally acting as a foreign agent, of offering to trade sex for a job as part of a covert effort by Russian government officials to infiltrate Republican circles in the United States.\nIn a court filing late Friday, prosecutors in the United States attorney\u2019s office in Washington acknowledged that they had been \u201cmistaken\u201d in interpreting what were apparently joking text messages between Ms. Butina and a friend who had helped her renew her car insurance.\nMs. Butina was charged this summer with conspiracy and illegally acting as an agent of the Russian government in what prosecutors have claimed was a secret campaign to try to influence high-level Republican politicians, including Donald J. Trump, both as a candidate and after his election. Denied bail, she is now in custody in the detention center in Alexandria, Va.\nDefense lawyers for Ms. Butina are arguing that the prosecutors\u2019 error is emblematic of a flawed federal case that has wrongly landed their client in pretrial custody. A federal judge is scheduled to review Ms. Butina\u2019s request that she be released from jail, as well as whether to impose a gag order, on Monday.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad they walked it back, but in a lot of ways, the damage is already done,\u201d Robert N. Driscoll, Ms. Butina\u2019s lawyer, said in an interview. In court filings, he has argued that his client engaged in innocent political activity but has now been falsely portrayed as a villain in a sensationalized spy drama. \u201cA simple Google search using the phrase \u2018Maria Butina and sex\u2019 yields over 300,000 hits,\u201d he said.\nIn their latest filing, prosecutors argued that even if they had wrongly interpreted Ms. Butina\u2019s text messages to a friend, she should not be released from custody, because she was likely to flee the country. Since her arrest, they said, it has become even clearer that she was not simply a foreign graduate student with an interest in American politics, but a Russian operative.\nThey said that Russian government emissaries had visited her at least six times in jail, and that Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, had complained twice about her prosecution to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. \u201cThe actions of the Russian Federation and its officials toward the defendant have confirmed her relationship with, and value to, her own government,\u201d they said.", "date": "Sept. 8, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/08/us/politics/maria-butina-sex.html", "tags": "prosecutors admit butina wrongly russian accused offering \u201d access sex custody republican federal ms. government"}
