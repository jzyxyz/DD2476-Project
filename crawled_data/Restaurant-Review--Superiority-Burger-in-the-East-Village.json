{"title": "Restaurant Review: Superiority Burger in the East Village", "content": "We all know restaurants where the menu changes daily. Last week at Superiority Burger, a vegetarian medium-fast-food outfit in the East Village, it changed in the middle of my meal.\nI was eating a tofu wrap and a salad of tender red-veined chard with pickled onions and juice-heavy blackberries at one of the six seats. These have swing-down desktops that remind me of college lecture halls and the old Prime Burger that used to sit across 51st Street from St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral.\nYou can occupy an individual burger desk in a popular restaurant for only so long before the urge to let somebody else sit down becomes overpowering. So when I got back in line to place a second order at the counter, I asked for takeout.\nThe chard salad, served like most of the vegetables in a paper boat, was no more. Taped to the spot on the white-tiled wall where its name had been written on a white card in black marker was something new: juicy green heirloom tomatoes with chopped corn. I wondered if one of the cooks had just tried out a new dish on Brooks Headley, the chef and owner, and he\u2019d said, at 7:30 in the evening, \u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d\nThat was not far off, it turned out. \u201cWe\u2019ve come up with a lot of our specials during little lulls in service,\u201d Mr. Headley, who was the pastry chef at Del Posto until he opened Superiority Burger in June, told Lucky Peach recently. \u201cEverybody runs down to the basement and picks up a project.\u201d\nNew ideas fly through the kitchen so quickly, you can almost hear them buzz by. This is what elevates Superiority Burger above what it appears to be at first glance, a Shake Shack for vegetarians. And it\u2019s why going back regularly, as I\u2019ve been doing, is an adventure. The avid experimentations of Mr. Headley and his cooks remind me of what was going on in the first year at Momofuku Noodle Bar, when David Chang and Joaquin Baca were on the edge of giving up and came back by cooking as if it were their last chance.\nNothing at Superiority Burger contains meat, and most dishes can be made without animal products on request. Some of them you can be sure of finding every time, including the veggie burger that was famous from pop-ups before the restaurant opened. Others arrive out of nowhere and disappear a day or a week later.\nWhen it is among the specials taped to the wall, a meatless analogue of the Philadelphia cheesesteak interests me keenly. Shaved steak had been traded in for strips of yuba, the immortal Cheez Whiz for a smooth, subtly flavorful species of cashew cheese. The yuba mostly worked as texture; the flavor, which was strong and lasting, burst out of a spicy swirl of soft, deeply browned onions and green peppers. That sandwich did not mimic the flavor of a cheesesteak but conjured up enough of the sensations touched off by a cheesesteak to be an honest variation, not a fake. It was both heartfelt homage and its own, craveable thing.\nIt wasn\u2019t on the wall last time; I look forward to our reunion one day. The same goes for the ice-cold smashed cucumbers that seemed to have collided, in one of those fortuitous you-got-chocolate-in-my-peanut-butter accidents, with what tasted like spicy rice pudding.\n(Personal and confidential to the roasted fingerlings and eggplant last seen wearing capers and pine nuts in a radiant lemon vinaigrette: Please come back. I won\u2019t ask where you\u2019ve been if you don\u2019t ask me about the chard salad.)\nWhen it comes to Mr. Headley\u2019s gelati and sorbets, I try to adopt a Buddha-like state of nonattachment. These appear in a different two-scoop duet each night, one sorbet of ripe fruit straight from the market sharing a small paper cup with a dairy-based gelato. Last time, it was peach sorbet under gelato made with toasted hamburger buns; there were roasted peaches between them and a powder of the toasted buns, soaked in milk and dried, dusted over the top. When my Zen intentions weaken and I find myself wanting it again, I meditate on the impermanence of life as represented by a seductively lush nectarine sorbet I tasted a month ago.\nWearing the paper cap of an old-time burger flipper or soda jerk, Mr. Headley takes care to serve his ice creams just cold enough to slide when they touch your tongue. But they won\u2019t be melting; if you have ordered it with dinner and sat down at one of the burger desks, he\u2019ll wait until you\u2019ve finished before he picks up the scoop. I can\u2019t think of a better, more meticulously put-together $4 dessert in the city.\nTo my taste, it outshines the sandwich for which the place is named. The Superiority Burger is indeed superior to many other veggie burgers, but truly loving it may require a built-in desire for veggie burgers that I lack. Filling out its small Martin\u2019s potato bun, layered with melted Muenster, iceberg lettuce, roasted plum tomatoes, brown honey mustard and pickles, the patty is seared to an energetic crackle and has a satisfyingly tender bulk. The buildup is almost too convincing, because the patty itself, which tastes of mashed beans, nuts and grains, breaks the illusion. For a ground-beef fan, the Superiority Burger takes you almost all the way, then stops.\nAmong the sandwiches on the permanent roster, I prefer the Sloppy Dave. This is, of course, a meatless sloppy Joe, a sesame-seed roll filled with tofu in a marvelously spicy tomato sauce, with fried onions on top. I should say \u201cusually filled with tofu\u201d; the sandwich was almost all sauce on a first encounter, but it had more substance on subsequent tries.\nThe menu\u2019s nicest surprise is the Superiority Wrap, a whole-wheat tortilla encasing tofu and brown rice. A similar item is a staple of earnest vegetarian restaurants, where it typically tastes like a paper-towel tube packed with pulverized drywall moistened with Morrissey\u2019s tears. The Superiority Wrap is a much more rewarding proposition. The rice has an excellent nutty taste. Shredded cabbage has a refreshing effect. A streak of bright tahini whirred with roasted sweet and hot peppers cuts through the tofu like a searchlight. And I loved the playful sweetness provided by a vein of candied sunflower seeds.\nThe aesthetics of Superiority Burger are half-White Castle, half-punk. The menu board and signs borrow the stencils and ransom-note lettering from rock\u2019s safety-pin-and-spit era. Music swerves from Wire and the Clash to proto-punks like the y\u00e9-y\u00e9 singer Karina. The prices, which peak at $9 for the wrap, are as democratic as it gets.\nMr. Headley, a hard-core-band drummer, leads his restaurant with the collaborative spirit of a musical style that gave up peacock guitar solos for blitzkrieg-bopping ensemble playing. He\u2019ll tell anybody who asks that the cucumber salad isn\u2019t his, but the work of a sous-chef, Julia Goldberg, and his menu is loaded with shout-outs to other chefs and restaurants. The chard salad had \u201cZuni pickled onions,\u201d and raspberry sorbet came with \u201cCF cream cheese gelato.\u201d\n\u201cDoes CF stand for cruelty free?\u201d a customer asked.\n\u201cNo, Claudia Fleming.\u201d\nAnother name you may hear, if you go more than once, is your own. The woman at the counter surprised me one night by remembering not just my fake name but the real one of the last person I had brought. This was more than standard critic-spotting. She showed me a stack of yellow Post-it notes with the names of repeat customers.\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to learn them all,\u201d she said.", "date": "Sept. 1, 2015", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/02/dining/restaurant-review-superiority-burger-in-the-east-village.html", "tags": "like burger superiority tofu restaurant \u201d one salad last village headley review east"}
