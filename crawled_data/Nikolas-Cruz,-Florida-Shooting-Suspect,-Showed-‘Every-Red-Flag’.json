{"title": "Nikolas Cruz, Florida Shooting Suspect, Showed \u2018Every Red Flag\u2019", "content": "PARKLAND, Fla. \u2014 Before he was hauled into a jailhouse hearing room on Thursday, head bowed and shackled at the wrists and ankles, Nikolas Cruz had been causing trouble as long as anyone here could remember.\nNeighbors said patrol cars were regularly in his mother\u2019s driveway. More recently, Mr. Cruz, 19, had been expelled from his high school. He posted pictures of weapons and dead animals on social media.\nAlmost immediately after Mr. Cruz turned up at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., Wednesday and, the authorities said, killed 17 people with a semiautomatic rifle, the disconnected shards of a difficult life began to come together. Students and neighbors traded stories of their experiences with him and wondered if anything could have been done.\nSome of the stories fell within the bands of typical teenage mischief-making. But others \u2014 including a comment on YouTube Mr. Cruz may have posted last year saying he wished to be \u201ca professional school shooter\u201d \u2014 were considerably more troubling. The comment, left under the name \u201cnikolas cruz,\u201d was reported to the F.B.I. by someone who did not know Mr. Cruz, and the agency said on Thursday that it had been unable to determine who had posted it.\nMr. Cruz was taken into custody shortly after the massacre, and was booked on 17 counts of premeditated murder. He confessed to the shootings, according to an arrest affidavit. When he appeared via a jailhouse video hookup for his first court appearance on Thursday, the judge asked him whether he understood his circumstances.\n\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d he whispered.\nThe authorities released the names of all 17 victims on Thursday. They were teachers and students, the kinds of people who bring a school to life: a popular football coach who himself had gone to the school, a soccer player, a trombonist in the marching band.\nLori Alhadeff, the mother of one of the victims, Alyssa Alhadeff, 14, said she had a message for President Trump.\n\u201cPresident Trump, we need action, we need change,\u201d she said, tears streaming down her face. \u201cGet these guns out of the hands of these young kids and get these guns off the streets.\u201d\nThe president, who generally opposes new gun restrictions, has focused on mental illness during mass shootings, and did so again on Thursday, beginning with a post on Twitter.\nLater, in his televised address, Mr. Trump said he planned to work with state and local leaders to \u201ctackle the difficult issue of mental health.\u201d\nOn Thursday night, Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, a Republican, told CNN that he would \u201cdo everything I can to make sure this never happens again.\u201d\nPressed repeatedly as to whether he would commit to tightening gun restrictions in his state, Mr. Scott said that he would be \u201cstrong on that,\u201d and that \u201ceverything is on the table.\u201d\nBut he also made clear that there were \u201ca lot of things\u201d at play, such as who should have guns, how to make schools safer, and how to make it easier for children to report problems.\nMr. Cruz had no criminal history before the shootings, according to state law enforcement records. But his childhood was certainly troubled.\nHe spent much of it in a subdivision called Pine Tree Estates, on a lush, narrow street dotted with tropical plants and the occasional driveway basketball hoop. Mr. Cruz and his brother, Zachary, had been adopted, and were raised largely by their mother, Lynda Cruz, especially after their father, Roger P. Cruz, died suddenly in 2004 at the age of 67. Ms. Cruz died in November, and people who knew Nikolas said he had taken the loss hard.\nPaul Gold, 45, said he lived next door to the Cruzes in 2009 and 2010 and stayed in touch with Lynda Cruz over the years.\n\u201cHe had emotional problems and I believe he was diagnosed with autism,\u201d Mr. Gold said of Nikolas Cruz. \u201cHe had trouble controlling his temper. He broke things. He would do that sometimes at our house when he lost his temper. But he was always very apologetic afterwards.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cHe would sometimes be hitting his head and covering his ears. One time, I sent him home because he was misbehaving at our house and he took a golf club and smashed one of my trailers.\u201d\nHe said that Mr. Cruz at one point had gone to a school for students with special needs. \u201cKids were really picking on him and would gang up on him and beat him up a little,\u201d Mr. Gold said. \u201cThey ostracized him. He didn\u2019t have many friends.\u201d\nHe said that Mr. Cruz\u2019s mother had done what she could to take care of him, and that the two had an extremely strong bond.\n\u201cHis mother was his entire life and when he lost her, I believe that was it for the boy\u2019s peace of mind,\u201d he said.\nOther neighbors said Mr. Cruz was a regular source of agitation. Helen Pasciolla said Lynda Cruz had called sheriff\u2019s deputies to the house numerous times in an effort to keep Mr. Cruz in line. Craig Koblitz, 62, a yacht repairman who lives across the street, said some neighbors had suspected him of burglarizing a nearby house a few years ago.\nAbout six years ago, Mr. Koblitz returned to his home to find Mr. Cruz scooping the fish from the pond in his palm-shaded front yard. He found it odd that the boy did not seem to express much surprise or guilt over being caught stealing.\nSarah Edelsberg, 16, remembered being frightened by Mr. Cruz when they were in middle school together. Mr. Cruz would walk by her and her friends and shout at them \u2014 randomly and menacingly, she said, with wild gestures of his arms.\nShe said he was small of build, wore a constant smirk and seemed eager to provoke confrontations. Teachers, she said, sometimes dealt with his behavior problems by forcing him to sit outside their portable classrooms.\nThe authorities said Mr. Cruz was expelled from Stoneman Douglas last year. Victoria Olvera, a 17-year-old junior, told The Associated Press that Mr. Cruz had gotten into a fight with his ex-girlfriend\u2019s new boyfriend.\nBut Michael Goldfarb, whose 17-year-old son Bradley knew Mr. Cruz, said his son had told him Mr. Cruz was expelled for having a knife at school.\nLast year, Mr. Goldfarb said, his son went on a three-day trip to a cabin in the Everglades with other young men, including Mr. Cruz. They were accompanied by a parent who owned the cabin.\nShooting weapons was a big part of the trip\u2019s allure. There were two AR-15s on the trip, and Mr. Cruz brought one of them.\nHe bragged about how he had bought it from a pawnshop, Mr. Goldfarb said, speaking for his son. (The authorities said the gun had been legally purchased from a gun shop.)\nThe YouTube comment appeared last fall on the channel of Ben Bennight, a bail bondsman in Mississippi.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be a professional school shooter,\u201d the Sept. 24 comment said, under the user name \u201cnikolas cruz.\u201d\nMr. Bennight took a screenshot and flagged it to YouTube, which removed the post. Then, Mr. Bennight said, he left a voice mail message at his local F.B.I. office alerting them about the comment.\nMr. Bennight, 36, said on Thursday that a pair of agents interviewed him the next morning. But the F.B.I. never learned who posted the comment.\n\u201cNo other information was included in the comment which would indicate a particular time, location, or the true identity of the person who posted the comment,\u201d the F.B.I. said in a statement on Thursday. The F.B.I. said it had conducted database reviews and other checks.\nAfter his expulsion, Mr. Cruz took a job at a dollar store near his old school. Ms. Edelsberg said she had seen him there a number of times. Now, she said, he seemed less scary than friendly. He asked her for news from Stoneman Douglas.\nOn Thursday, Jordan Jereb, a leader of a white supremacist group based in North Florida, told The Associated Press that Mr. Cruz had joined the group, but later Mr. Jereb said that he did not know whether that was true.\nThe family of another schoolmate, the Snead family, took in Mr. Cruz because his friend felt badly that Mr. Cruz was now alone in the world, said Jim Lewis, a lawyer for the family. The Sneads had allowed Mr. Cruz to bring his gun with him to their house, insisting that he keep it in a lockbox.\nOn weekday mornings, Mr. Cruz usually got up to catch a ride to adult education courses that the Sneads had encouraged him to attend. But on Wednesday, he refused to get up, Mr. Lewis said.\nMr. Lewis said Mr. Cruz had said something to the effect of: \u201cI don\u2019t go to school on Valentine\u2019s Day.\u201d\nHoward Finkelstein, the chief public defender in Broward County, said in an interview that Mr. Cruz\u2019s legal team had not yet decided whether to mount an insanity defense. Prosecutors have not said whether they will seek the death penalty, but Mr. Finkelstein argued that Mr. Cruz should not be a candidate for execution, given his mental health history.\n\u201cEvery red flag was there and nobody did anything,\u201d Mr. Finkelstein said. \u201cWhen we let one of our children fall off grid, when they are screaming for help in every way, do we have the right to kill them when we could have stopped it?\u201d\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Cruz and the Sneads\u2019 son were texting until 2:18 p.m., Mr. Lewis said \u2014 about five minutes before the first 911 calls about the shooting.\n\u201cBut there was nothing crazy in the texts,\u201d Mr. Lewis said.\nMr. Cruz arrived at the school in a small, gold-colored Uber, according to the booking report from the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Office. He was wearing a black hat, with a black duffel and a black backpack.\nWithin a minute there were gunshots.\nLater, in custody, Mr. Cruz told investigators that \u201che was the gunman who entered the school campus armed with an AR-15 and began shooting students that he saw in the hallways and on the school grounds,\u201d the report said.\nThe police would find him an hour later in the nearby city of Coral Springs. In the report, Mr. Cruz said he had slipped away from the campus by ditching the gun and the extra magazines he brought along, joining the crowd of worried students fleeing the school.\nUnarmed and anonymous, Mr. Cruz, finally, had blended in among them.", "date": "Feb. 15, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/15/us/nikolas-cruz-florida-shooting.html", "tags": "shooting suspect showed \u2018 flag cruz thursday red nikolas every \u201d school one florida comment said"}
