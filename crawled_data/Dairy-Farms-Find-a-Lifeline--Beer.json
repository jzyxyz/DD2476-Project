{"title": "Dairy Farms Find a Lifeline: Beer", "content": "Every day since 1938, farmhands at the 1,000-acre Carter & Stevens Farm, in central Massachusetts, have milked cows in the morning and afternoon. The same family has overseen operations for five generations. A sixth seemed uncertain.\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a historic low nationwide in terms of farmers getting money for their milk,\u201d said Sean DuBois, who works in the family business. (His wife, Molly Stevens, is the daughter of the third-generation patriarch, Phil Stevens.)\nPrices have cratered, driven by high supply and falling demand. For Carter & Stevens, staying solvent required creative thinking. \u201cTo succeed today as a dairy farm, you need to diversify,\u201d Mr. DuBois said. \u201cWe found our passion for craft beer.\u201d\nThe farm opened Stone Cow Brewery in 2016, making beers like the Roll in the Hay I.P.A., which sells for $7 a pint at its taproom. That makes the beverage much more profitable than the dairy\u2019s raw milk, which currently sells wholesale for about 16 cents per pint, even though it costs more to produce.\n\u201cIt\u2019s totally changed our farm forever,\u201d said Mr. DuBois, 37, who manages the brewery.\nAmerica\u2019s dairies have been gut-punched by declining milk prices \u2014 some dropping about 40 percent in recent years \u2014 and demand, as consumers embrace soy, nut and other milks, and the Greek yogurt craze cools. In some places, despair has set in: Three members of the Agri-Mark Dairy cooperative, which represents about 1,000 dairy farmers in the Northeast, have killed themselves in recent years, the latest in January.\nTo save their livelihoods, many dairy farms have started breweries, bolstering bottom lines with a different kind of liquid capital.\nIt\u2019s another chapter in the dairy and brewing industries\u2019 interlinked history. Brewers often supply farmers with spent grains for feed, and many American craft breweries have started by using secondhand dairy infrastructure.\nKen Grossman founded Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. in Chico, Calif., in 1980 with equipment scavenged from closed Midwestern dairies. The tanks were attractive because of their abundance, affordability and high sanitary standards. \u201cFor a small brewer who wasn\u2019t going to pasteurize his beer, having hygienically designed equipment was a real boon,\u201d Mr. Grossman said.\nDairies also adapt empty tanks for alternate uses \u2014 as Josh Cody\u2019s family eventually did after its dairy farm in Alamosa, Colo., fell on hard times in the mid-1990s. \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t fiscally viable for a family operation our size to milk cows,\u201d said Mr. Cody, who was 12 when dairy operations wound down.\nThe farm started producing barley on a large scale for Coors Brewing. But family members sold off land, until, by 2006, the remaining fields weren\u2019t economically viable. \u201cWe were following the normal farm story in America where we almost went bankrupt,\u201d Mr. Cody said.\nIn a last-ditch effort, the family began a malting operation, transforming raw barley into more valuable malt \u2014 beer\u2019s main building block. The family retrofitted a dairy tank to store the malt, and created the Colorado Malting Company in 2008.\nIn April, the farm finished the final leg on its beer journey, opening the Colorado Farm Brewery. \u201cWe\u2019re making estate beers,\u201d Mr. Cody said. As the head brewer, he uses the farm\u2019s hops, grain, well water and a yeast strain native to the property.\nTo brighten a bleak financial outlook, Carter & Stevens, in Barre, Mass., started a farmstand in 2005 to sell produce, maple syrup and ice cream, soon adding a weekend barbecue featuring its grass-fed-beef burgers. \u201cIf we could sell them a pint or two of beer to go with their meal, that would be a bonus,\u201d Mr. DuBois said.\nPlans for a brewery were imperiled when a barn intended as its home burned down. Neighbors rode to the rescue by donating their 1820 dairy barn, rebuilt on the charred structure\u2019s site. Carter & Stevens installed brewing equipment bought at an auction, hired a brewer and opened Stone Cow, decorating the property with a 10,000-pound stone cow.\n\u201cWe have people that come in and get a growler of beer and a gallon of milk,\u201d Mr. DuBois said. \u201cWe take so much pride when people buy our milk. That\u2019s our heritage.\u201d\nS & S Brewery, in Nassau, N.Y., opened in the Sanford family\u2019s old milking house in 2014. A feed shortfall forced the family, which had worked the land since the 1800s, to sell its herd in 1996. Selling hay barely brought in enough money to cover taxes. \u201cWe were in desperate need to keep things going,\u201d said the brewer, Jason Sanford.\nAfter beers like its Brown Chicken Brown Ale sold well at farmers\u2019 markets, the family turned a dairy barn into a taproom. Where cows once chewed cud, customers now converse over crisp pints of Hayfield Blonde as cattle roam outside.\n\u201cFor a while I was watching the barn fall apart, and now I have hope that the brewery will bring life back to the farm,\u201d said Carol Sanford, an owner of the farm.\nBreweries are also resuscitating shuttered dairy farms. Zack and Laura Adams opened Fox Farm last spring in a renovated 1960s dairy barn on a 30-acre farm in Salem, Conn. The hayloft was cut out to create catwalks for reaching towering fermentation tanks, and the barn\u2019s layout lets Mr. Adams easily load raw materials into the former milk room.\nPorters, pilsners and I.P.A.s are served from taps topped with the property\u2019s old shovels, and customers include former farm employees. The property\u2019s rebirth is a point of pride. \u201cIf you care about the rural heritage of a town, supporting adaptive reuse is necessary,\u201d Mr. Adams said.\nFonta Flora Brewery in Morganton, N.C., is currently turning part of the Whippoorwill Dairy Farm, which dates to the early 20th century, into a brewery. The buildings, constructed with irregularly shaped river stones, look \u201cmore like a monastery in Belgium than anything you\u2019d associate with a farm in the South,\u201d said Todd Boera, the head of brewing operations.\nOne structure is devoted to creating spontaneously fermented beer \u2014 made with wild yeast that has never been cultivated \u2014 while the milking parlor will be filled with large oak vessels to age beer.\n\u201cThis is a true revitalization of that property,\u201d Mr. Boera said, adding that he hopes someday to add dairy cows. \u201cIt\u2019d be cool to offer a dairy product to return the farm to what it once was.\u201d\nFollow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.
