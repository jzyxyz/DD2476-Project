{"title": "Trump\u2019s Intelligence Nominee Gets Early Lesson in Managing White House", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 If Dan Coats, President Trump\u2019s nominee to serve as the director of national intelligence, had any illusions about what he was getting into, the past seven weeks have certainly made clear the challenges he will face in a job created after the Sept. 11 attacks to coordinate the activities of the entire intelligence community.\nMr. Coats, 73, a former senator from Indiana, has already had to fend off a move by Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist, and Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law, to bring in a New York private equity billionaire to run a White House review of the intelligence community \u2014 a plan that Mr. Coats and many senior intelligence officials saw as a White House attempt to curtail their independence and reduce the flow of information that contradicts the president\u2019s worldview.\nOnce confirmed \u2014 the Senate intelligence committee voted on Thursday to send his nomination to the full Senate \u2014 Mr. Coats will face a far trickier political balancing act. He will be overseeing the same intelligence agencies that are examining Russia\u2019s meddling in the election and possible ties between the Trump campaign and Moscow, while also trying to assuage Mr. Trump\u2019s deep distrust of the nation\u2019s spies.\nIt \u201cis an extraordinarily difficult job, particularly in the current environment,\u201d said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine and a member of the intelligence committee. But she said she was confident that Mr. Coats would know how to manage the Trump White House.\n\u201cHe does not fight his battles on the front page of the newspaper,\u201d Ms. Collins said. \u201cHe works quietly, but extremely effectively, and he\u2019s persistent and he\u2019s unafraid.\u201d\n\u201cAlso, he has nothing to lose,\u201d she added. \u201cHe was prepared to retire. They need him.\u201d\nAt his confirmation hearing last week, Mr. Coats signaled that he would push forward with the intelligence community\u2019s own inquiry into Russian meddling, and would cooperate with separate Senate and House investigations.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s our responsibility to provide you access to all that you need,\u201d he said.\nHe added that Russian meddling \u201cneeds to be investigated.\u201d\nBut how much influence Mr. Coats will have in his job remains an open question. He was not part of the Trump campaign \u2014 his tie to the administration is through Vice President Mike Pence, the former governor of Indiana \u2014 and it appears that at least some of Mr. Trump\u2019s closest advisers would prefer to have a reliable ally overseeing the intelligence community.\nUntil last week, the White House was weighing a plan to bring in Stephen A. Feinberg, a co-founder of Cerberus Capital Management and a friend of Mr. Bannon and Mr. Kushner, to lead a White House review of the intelligence community.\nStiff resistance from Mr. Coats and Mike Pompeo, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency \u2014 aided by pushback from allies in the Senate and even Mr. Pence \u2014 appears to have derailed the plan. Mr. Feinberg is now in discussions with administration officials to take on a still-undetermined role in defense, rather than intelligence, according to several people familiar with the matter.\nBut Mr. Coats had little time to savor that triumph before Mr. Trump posted a series of Twitter messages early Saturday morning accusing former President Barack Obama, without any evidence, of \u201cwire tapping\u201d him during the 2016 presidential campaign.\nMr. Trump\u2019s accusation was denied by a spokesman for Mr. Obama and by James R. Clapper Jr., the former director of national intelligence. The F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, unsuccessfully pressed the Justice Department to issue a denial.\nThe White House has backed away from the allegations, but they add up to yet another issue complicating Mr. Coats\u2019s new job.\n\u201cHe is going to have to work restore morale within the intelligence community,\u201d Senator Collins said adding that \u201cHe truly has a deep appreciation for the role that the men and women of the intelligence community play.\u201d\nStill, Mr. Coats comes to the agency with less experience in intelligence matters than any previous national intelligence director. He served as a congressman from Indiana before retiring from politics in 1998 after it became apparent that he would probably lose his re-election race.\nAfter working as a lobbyist, Mr. Coats was appointed ambassador to Germany by President George W. Bush, who also considered him for secretary of defense.\nHe resigned as ambassador in 2005 and then returned to lobbying, joining the firm of King & Spalding, where he earned more than $600,000 a year and did work directly related to the intelligence community.\nHe represented Sprint, the telecommunications firm, when the Bush administration was pushing Congress to expand the government\u2019s surveillance powers under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, The Associated Press reported this year. As part of the legislation, Sprint and other telecommunication companies won legal immunity against lawsuits for their collaboration with the National Security Agency on its warrantless wiretapping program, which had been secretly approved by President Bush after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\nIn 2010, Mr. Coats ran again for his old Senate seat. He defeated the man who had replaced him 12 years earlier, Evan Bayh, serving one term before retiring again in 2016. In November, Mr. Trump appointed him to the national intelligence job.\nWhile waiting to be confirmed, Mr. Coats has had to contend with the possibility of being usurped by Mr. Feinberg even before taking up the new job.\nMr. Coats saw Mr. Feinberg\u2019s potential appointment as an effort by Mr. Bannon and Mr. Kushner to undercut him, according to current and former officials. He believed Mr. Feinberg\u2019s review would interfere with his ability to fulfill his role coordinating activities of the intelligence community.\nIntelligence officials also feared that Mr. Feinberg\u2019s review would merely be a steppingstone before he was placed into one of the top positions in the intelligence community. Mr. Bannon and Mr. Kushner also reportedly considered him for either director of national intelligence or chief of the C.I.A.\u2019s clandestine service, a role normally reserved for career intelligence officers.\nMr. Trump was apparently unaware of the fierce resistance within the intelligence community to the proposal until the planned appointment was reported last month. Sen. Richard Burr, the powerful chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, was also not aware of the proposal until then, officials said.\nFaced with opposition to the plan, Mr. Trump played down the possibility of the appointment when asked about it at a lengthy news conference on Feb. 16. Mr. Trump said that Mr. Feinberg was \u201ca very talented man, very successful man\u201d but that he was not needed at this time \u201cbecause of the fact that, you know, I think that we are going to be able to straighten it out very easily on its own.\u201d", "date": "March 9, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/09/us/politics/trump-coats-national-intelligence.html", "tags": "intelligence community coats early \u201c nominee lesson trump white house gets \u2014 managing"}
