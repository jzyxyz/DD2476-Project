{"title": "Donald Trump\u2019s Campaign Stands By Embrace of Putin", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Donald J. Trump\u2019s campaign on Thursday reaffirmed its extraordinary embrace of Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, signaling a preference for the leadership of an authoritarian adversary over that of America\u2019s own president, despite a cascade of criticism from Democrats and expressions of discomfort among Republicans.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s inarguable that Vladimir Putin has been a stronger leader in his country than Barack Obama has been in this country,\u201d Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, Mr. Trump\u2019s running mate, said on CNN, defending Mr. Trump by echoing his latest praise for the Russian leader, offered Wednesday night in a televised candidate forum.\nHillary Clinton excoriated Mr. Trump for asserting that Mr. Putin is a better leader than President Obama, saying it was \u201cnot just unpatriotic and insulting to the people of our country, as well as to our commander in chief \u2014 it is scary.\u201d\nShe seized on Mr. Trump\u2019s assertion in the televised forum that Mr. Putin\u2019s incursions into neighboring countries, crackdown on Russia\u2019s independent news media and support for America\u2019s enemies were no more troublesome than Mr. Obama\u2019s transgressions. She said it showed that, if elected, Mr. Trump would be little more than a tool of Mr. Putin.\n\u201cIt suggests he will let Putin do whatever Putin wants to do and then make excuses for him,\u201d Mrs. Clinton told reporters Thursday morning at Westchester County Airport in New York, stepping up her criticism as polls indicate the race has tightened, and as Mr. Trump continues to say things rarely heard before from a major party\u2019s presidential nominee.\nIn Wednesday\u2019s forum, which was moderated by Matt Lauer of NBC and was devoted to national security issues, Mr. Trump twice denigrated America\u2019s generals; suggested he would fire the country\u2019s current military leadership; and insinuated \u2014 vaguely, unverifiably and without evidence \u2014 that the intelligence officials who recently gave him a classified briefing about threats to the United States had said that the president had flouted their advice.\nMrs. Clinton delighted at the chance to change the subject from her uneven performance at the forum, under treatment by Mr. Lauer that many observers believed was harsher than his handling of Mr. Trump. Her campaign could barely contain its wonder that her opponents were now allowing her to chain Mr. Trump to a Russian leader widely seen as hostile to the United States.\nIn the forum, Mr. Trump said of Mr. Putin that he had been a leader \u201cfar more than our president,\u201d and he praised Mr. Putin\u2019s firm grip on Russia.\nAnd after Mr. Lauer highlighted Mr. Putin\u2019s record, Mr. Trump shot back, \u201cBut do you want me to start naming some of the things that President Obama does at the same time?\u201d\nSuch talk is a remarkable break from the traditional boundaries of American political speech. And, as with his past provocations, Mr. Trump once again left his fellow Republicans scrambling to defend what many effectively conceded was indefensible.\n\u201cVladimir Putin is an aggressor who does not share our interests,\u201d Speaker Paul D. Ryan told reporters on Thursday in Washington, accusing the Russian leader of \u201cconducting state-sponsored cyberattacks\u201d on \u201cour political system.\u201d\nMr. Ryan was referring to the hack of the servers of the Democratic National Committee, which American officials believe was conducted by Russian intelligence services. At the NBC forum, Mr. Trump disputed Russia\u2019s guilt, telling Mr. Lauer the culprits were not definitively known.\nMr. Trump went even further on Thursday, saying in an interview on the Kremlin-backed Russia Today network that it was \u201cprobably unlikely\u201d Russia was trying to interfere in the election and that Democrats \u201care putting that out.\u201d\nIn a fashion that would have been unheard-of for a Republican during or immediately after the Cold War, Mr. Trump has made improved relations with the Kremlin a centerpiece of his candidacy. And Russia has been a subplot of the campaign that Tom Clancy and John le Carre together may have been unable to conjure, complete with the apparent Russian hack of one of America\u2019s political parties, a threat that Russian hackers may try to tamper with electronic voting machines, and Mr. Putin\u2019s unsubtle preference for Mr. Trump over Mrs. Clinton.\nWhile railing against Asian, Latin American and Middle Eastern countries, Mr. Trump has continually praised Mr. Putin\u2019s government: He has hailed Mr. Putin\u2019s tight control over Russian society, hinted that he may not defend the NATO-aligned Baltic nations formerly in Moscow\u2019s sphere of influence, and for a time employed a campaign chief with close ties to Ukraine\u2019s pro-Russian forces.\nMost extraordinarily, he used a news conference over the summer to urge the Russians to hack into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails to find messages the F.B.I. might have missed.\nIt is all rather confounding \u2014 unless Mr. Trump is simply eyeing postelection business interests \u2014 for congressional Republicans, who evince little doubt that Moscow was behind the hack of the Democratic National Committee. On Thursday, they volunteered the sort of hard-edged criticism of Mr. Putin more typical of conservatives discussing an adversary of the United States.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a thug,\u201d said Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. \u201cHe\u2019s a dangerous and bad guy.\u201d\nBut Mr. Rubio, who is running for re-election, has gotten behind Mr. Trump since withdrawing from the presidential primary, and he declined to say whether Mr. Trump\u2019s comments were out of bounds because, he said, he did not want to \u201cbe a commentator.\u201d\nEven Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, perhaps Mr. Trump\u2019s closest ally on Capitol Hill, appeared ill at ease when pressed about Mr. Trump\u2019s statements.\nAsked whether political combat should stop at the water\u2019s edge, Mr. Sessions paused for nearly 10 seconds before saying, \u201cI\u2019ve tried to adhere to that line pretty assiduously, but less and less does that get adhered to in the modern world.\u201d\nDemocrats were at once dumbfounded over Mr. Trump\u2019s latest verbal excess, gleeful over a fresh opportunity to portray him as unpresidential and irritated that he had not been pressed more aggressively by Mr. Lauer.\nMingling outside the Capitol on a broiling day, the Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid, and Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, two of the longest-serving and bluntest-speaking members of Congress, found themselves uncharacteristically at a loss for words.\n\u201cIf Rangel or Reid had said that, 15 years ago or five years ago, we would be through,\u201d Mr. Reid said of Mr. Trump\u2019s Putin praise. \u201cCan you imagine somebody running for president who has acknowledged publicly that he likes Putin better than Obama? How about that one?\u201d\nMr. Rangel interjected: \u201cA communist leader that\u2019s a potential enemy!\u201d\nOther Democrats, though, saw Mr. Trump\u2019s comments about Mr. Putin as a bonanza, given the scrutiny of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server as secretary of state. Representative Joseph Crowley of New York called Mr. Trump\u2019s suggestion that Russians should hack into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails \u201cverbal treason\u201d and said Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cdiarrhea of the mouth\u201d would be his undoing.\nDemocrats and even some Republicans said the fury would have been unceasing on the right had a Democratic presidential candidate held up the leader of a hostile power to deride a Republican president.\nScholars could recall few parallels in modern American history. Only the campaign of Henry Wallace, the Progressive Party nominee in 1948, was so willing to align itself with Russia, the historian Richard Norton Smith said. \u201cWe\u2019ve become to some degree numbed to this, saying, \u2018That\u2019s just Trump,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s dangerous.\u201d\nIn her news conference Thursday, Mrs. Clinton invoked the right\u2019s most venerated president, from whose library Mr. Pence appeared on CNN. \u201cWhat would Ronald Reagan say about a Republican nominee who attacks American generals and heaps praise on Russia\u2019s president?\u201d she asked.\nAfter the news conference, Mrs. Clinton flew to North Carolina to rally African-American voters, and seized the chance to assail Mr. Trump\u2019s comments again. \u201cHe prefers the Russian president to our president,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said in Charlotte.\nBut Mr. Trump showed no sign of regret. His aides did not reply to an email asking if the campaign wanted to clarify his comments about Mr. Putin, and deemed Mrs. Clinton\u2019s assault \u201cthe desperate attacks of a flailing campaign sinking in the polls.\u201d\nMr. Trump himself appeared mostly focused on news coverage of the NBC forum. \u201cWow, reviews are in \u2014 THANK YOU!\u201d he wrote on Twitter.", "date": "Sept. 8, 2016", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/09/us/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-putin.html", "tags": "clinton embrace president \u201d trump stands donald russia mrs. campaign putin"}
