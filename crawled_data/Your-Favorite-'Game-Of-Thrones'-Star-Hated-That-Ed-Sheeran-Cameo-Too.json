{"title": "Your Favorite 'Game Of Thrones' Star Hated That Ed Sheeran Cameo Too", "content": "Ed Sheeran can sing about castles on the hill all he wants, but that doesn\u2019t mean he belongs in Westeros. At least according to one unyielding \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d star, it doesn\u2019t.\nSheeran\u2019s missable appearance on the show last year irked more than a few fans who couldn\u2019t understand why he popped up to serenade Arya and didn\u2019t even die afterward. The cameo didn\u2019t sit right with Hodor, Kristian Nairn, either.\nIn an in-depth interview this month, Nairn told HuffPost, \u201cI\u2019m not a fan of the cameos in \u2018Game of Thrones.\u2019 I don\u2019t like them. I think it\u2019s stupid. I don\u2019t mind going on the record on that. I just think it takes you right out of the world.\u201d\n\u201cEspecially Ed Sheeran,\u201d he said. \u201cI was like, \u2018Why is Ed Sheeran here?\u2019 I mean, Ed Sheeran\u2019s great. He\u2019s a great guy, great musician, but why is he in \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019?\u201d\nThe controversial cameo is in the Season 7 premiere, when Arya (Maisie Williams) happens on a group of soldiers en route to King\u2019s Landing.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying I\u2019m not a fan of Ed Sheeran,\u201d\u00a0Nairn clarified. \u201cI\u2019m being tactful here, but just not a fan of the cameo. I think most people would agree with me there. It was a big snap to reality.\u00a0It\u2019s like, \u2018What? What?\u2019\u201d\nHe added, \u201cIt\u2019s a fantasy show. We\u2019re all caught in this amazing world and spend so much time and money and talent to create, and all of a sudden there\u2019s a pop star? What?\u201d\nWhat indeed.\nIn the scene, Sheeran plays a Lannister soldier sitting with a few comrades when Arya shows up. Keep in mind that earlier in the episode,\u00a0she murdered a bunch of Freys as revenge for the Red Wedding (which was orchestrated with the Lannisters).\nWatching it unfold, you wonder, \u201cOh, is Arya about to go class A-Team and crumble his face like pastries?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nBut no. Instead\u00a0\u2014 just in case you weren\u2019t absolutely, positively sure that the guy who looks exactly like Ed Sheeran is the real Ed Sheeran \u2014 he sings a song.\nRepeat: Ed Sheeran shows up and sings a song.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new one,\u201d he says.\nFans proceeded to unload relentless ire. Puns were made. Memes were born.\u00a0\nThere was a rumor that Sheeran left Twitter because of the online wildfire. But he denied it,\u00a0saying he had always planned to abandon the platform and his cameo was \u201cclearly fuckin\u2019 awesome.\u201d\nIf you weren\u2019t in love with the moment, look, it\u2019s not all Sheeran\u2019s fault.\u00a0He was reportedly cast in the show as a sweet\u00a0surprise for Williams, who\u2019s a fan. And there were plenty of other cameos\u00a0before his.\nTo name a few: Members of the metal group Mastodon appear in the Season 5 episode \u201cHardhome,\u201d reprising their roles in Season 7 as wights; Of Monsters and Men strum instruments in the background of the play Arya watches in Season 6 (and weighed in on an Arya theory\u00a0for HuffPost); and Sigur R\u00f3s shows up at Joffrey\u2019s wedding in Season 4, which was the only cameo Nairn could get behind.\n\u201c[Sigur R\u00f3s] kind of got away with it because they\u2019re so quirky ... They\u2019re almost like \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 world in real life. They\u2019re so elven and spiritual. I think that works, but apart from that \u2014 I mean, I understand why people want to be in it, but just no. Go away.\u201d\u00a0\nFor more from Nairn, including\u00a0what it was like to come out more publicly while on the show\u00a0and whether we\u2019ve seen the last of Hodor, check out our interview.", "date": "\n06/26/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/game-of-thrones-star-hated-ed-sheeran-cameo_n_5b27fa43e4b0f0b9e9a3a864", "tags": "like \u2018 nairn hated sheeran season favorite \u201d ed arya cameo thrones star"}
