{"title": "Fox News Didn't Air That Amazing Speech By The Father Of A Fallen Muslim Soldier", "content": "It\u2019s being called the \u201cmost powerful speech\u201dof the Democratic National Convention, something that is \u201cgoing to be remembered for decades.\u201d Even prominent Republicans were moved, with one calling it a \u201cdignified, damning indictment\u201d of the party\u2019s presidential nominee, Donald Trump.\u00a0\nBut had you turned on Fox News at 9 p.m. on Thursday\u00a0\u2015\u00a0during primetime coverage of the final night of the convention \u2015 you wouldn\u2019t have seen Khizr Khan, the Pakistani-born father of a Muslim American war hero killed in Iraq, deliver a blistering condemnation of Trump\u2019s anti-Muslim presidential campaign.\u00a0\nYou wouldn\u2019t have seen Khan standing next to his wife, who was wearing a headscarf, describe how honored they felt to be able to speak at the convention\u00a0\u201cas patriotic American Muslims with undivided loyalty to our country.\u201d And you wouldn\u2019t have seen Khan directly address Trump, who has called for a ban on Muslims entering the U.S.\u00a0\n\u201cLet me ask you, have you even read the U.S.\u00a0Constitution? I will gladly lend you my copy,\u201d Khan said, pulling a copy of the document from his jacket pocket to thunderous applause and cheers.\u00a0\n\u201cLook for the words \u2018liberty\u2019 and \u2018equal protection of law.\u2019 Have you ever been to Arlington National Cemetery? Go look at the graves of the brave patriots who died defending this country,\u201d Khan said. \u201cYou have sacrificed nothing, and no one.\u201d\nUnlike competitors CNN and MSNBC, Fox News only showed Khan\u2019s speech for two minutes \u2015 without audio, in a small window at the bottom of the screen \u2015 while the network aired commercials, including a Benghazi-themed attack ad against Hillary Clinton. During the rest of the address,\u00a0the channel opted to show host Megyn Kelly interview commentator Brit Hume.\u00a0\nAt the end of Kelly\u2019s show, she interrupted her guests to cut to a shot of pop star Katy Perry performing at the convention.\u00a0\n\u201cWe reported on the speeches and cited them throughout the evening and into today, as well,\u201d Jay Wallace, the executive vice president of news editorial, said Friday in a statement.\u00a0\nU.S. Army Captain Humayun Khan was killed in action in Iraq in 2004. When a vehicle packed with explosives drove toward his compound, the 27-year-old, who was born in the United Arab Emirates, ordered his unit to seek cover as he ran toward the vehicle, saving their lives. The vehicle exploded, killing the soldier.\u00a0\u00a0\nHe was posthumously awarded a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star.\u00a0His tombstone in Arlington National Cemetery is among many bearing the star and crescent symbol of the Islamic faith.\nIn addition to wanting a ban on all Muslims coming to the U.S., Trump has called for a national database of Muslims. He has also said that Muslims should be racially profiled, that mosques should be surveilled, and that\u00a0\u201cIslam hates us.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHillary Clinton was right when she called my son the best of America,\u201d Khan said during his speech. \u201cIf it was up to Donald Trump, he never would have been in America.\u201d\nEditor\u2019s note:\u00a0Donald Trump regularly\u00a0incites political violence\u00a0and is a\u00a0serial liar,\u00a0rampant xenophobe,\u00a0racist, misogynist\u00a0and\u00a0birther\u00a0who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims \u2015 1.6 billion members of an entire religion \u2015 from entering the U.S.\nThis piece has been updated to note that \u201cThe Kelly File\u201d played part of Khan\u2019s speech the day after the convention.", "date": "\n07/29/2016", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/fox-news-didnt-air-muslim-soldier-speech-khzir-khan_n_579b9b3de4b0e2e15eb5c5e9", "tags": "khan fox speech news u.s. muslims fallen \u201d soldier muslim \u2015 amazing convention called father air"}
