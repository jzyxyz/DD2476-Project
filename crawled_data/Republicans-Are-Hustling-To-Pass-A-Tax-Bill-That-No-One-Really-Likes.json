{"title": "Republicans Are Hustling To Pass A Tax Bill That No One Really Likes", "content": "The tax bill Republicans are on the verge of passing remains generally unloved by America, new polling shows.\nNearly every publicly released poll of the bill taken this December shows its numbers in the red, with support from the bill ranging between 26 percent and 44 percent, and averaging out to just over 30 percent. That would make it, if enacted, among the least popular pieces of major legislation\u00a0signed into law since the 1990s.\nAnd despite President Donald Trump\u2019s claim otherwise, the plan doesn\u2019t appear to be growing on the public \u2015 the most recent poll, released Monday by Monmouth University, was one of the worst recent surveys to date. In that survey, just 14 percent of Americans expected the tax plan to cut their own taxes, while half expected to have their taxes hiked. In a Quinnipiac poll released last week, 65 percent of voters thought the plan would mostly benefit the wealthy.\nThe considerable share of Americans who remain undecided or lukewarm gives the bill plenty of room to either gain or lose support.\u00a0Views of the Affordable Care Act\u00a0grew substantially worse \u2015 and then substantially better \u2015 in the years following its passage. The 2009 stimulus plan, which\u00a0passed with majority support, was\u00a0largely disliked a year later. Less promisingly for the tax plan, however, those people who aren\u2019t sure about it aren\u2019t too\u00a0likely to be big fans of the current president.\nThe plan suffers from a significant enthusiasm gap across many of the surveys, with strong opposition for the plan outpacing strong support (although few opponents cite taxes as a top issue).\nDemocrats and those who supported Hillary Clinton in 2016 are fervently against the bill. In Monmouth\u2019s survey, nearly three-quarters of Democrats disapproved of the plan, with 58 percent disapproving strongly. In a HuffPost/YouGov poll taken earlier this month, 82 percent of Clinton voters opposed the Senate bill, with 69 percent opposing it strongly.\n\u201cAs a teacher I can\u2019t write off the meager tax deduction I get to buy my supplies but a millionaire can write off his private jet,\u201d one Clinton voter wrote in response to the HuffPost/YouGov survey. Another respondent fumed: \u201cThe rich get a windfall. Working people get screwed.\u201d\nBy contrast, support for the bill is more lukewarm. In Monmouth\u2019s poll, just 55 percent of Republicans supported the tax plan, with fewer than a third strongly in favor. In the HuffPost/YouGov survey, two-thirds of Trump\u2019s supporters backed the plan, but just a quarter gave it their strong support.\n\u201cIt has something in it for almost everyone,\u201d one Trump voter from Georgia wrote. \u201cI have a son-in-law with a small business that will be greatly helped.\u201d\nBut others were les optimistic. \u201d[N]o sign of campaign promise to benefit poor & middle class, not the already wealthy or corporations,\u201d wrote a self-described conservative who counted herself among the tenth of Trump voters who oppose the bill.", "date": "\n12/18/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/republicans-unpopular-tax-bill_n_5a38218ae4b0860bf4aa5558", "tags": "support percent tax really hustling likes republicans poll one pass survey bill plan"}
