{"title": "Ohio Governor Signs Fetal Heartbeat Abortion Bill", "content": "COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) \u2014 Ohio\u2019s governor has signed a bill imposing one of the nation\u2019s toughest abortion restrictions.\nRepublican Gov. Mike DeWine followed through Thursday on his pledge to sign the heartbeat bill. It cleared the state Legislature on Wednesday.\nDeWine\u2019s signature makes Ohio the fifth state to ban abortions after the first detectable fetal heartbeat. That can come as early as five or six weeks into pregnancy, before many women know they\u2019re pregnant.\nDeWine\u2019s support for the bill breaks with his predecessor. Former Republican Gov. John Kasich (KAY\u2019-sik) twice vetoed it on grounds it was unconstitutional and would spark a costly court challenge.\nOpponents in Ohio have already vowed to sue.", "date": "\n04/11/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ohio-abortion-heartbeat-bill_n_5caf9ca4e4b0ffefe3ada94f", "tags": "ap heartbeat signs columbus republican abortion state bill \u2014 governor dewine ohio fetal gov"}
