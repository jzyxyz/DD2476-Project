{"title": "Steve King Is A White Supremacist, And The GOP Doesn\u2019t Care", "content": "On June 12, Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) tweeted: \u201cEurope is waking up... Will America... in time?\u201d and linked to an anti-immigrant tweet by a well-known British neo-Nazi named Mark Collett. \nA month later, the tweet is still there.\nKing told CNN that he had no plans to delete the tweet. Just because Collett might be a neo-Nazi, King argued, doesn\u2019t mean his tweet about immigration is wrong. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s the message, not the messenger,\u201d\u00a0King said.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not surprising that the eight-term congressman from Iowa retweeted a neo-Nazi. King has a long history of making terrible, bigoted comments. (He\u2019s the one who said\u00a0Dreamers\u00a0\u2015\u00a0young undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children \u2015 have calves the size of\u00a0cantaloupes\u00a0\u201cbecause they\u2019re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert.\u201d)\u00a0\nWhat is surprising, and concerning, is that a sitting U.S. congressman can unapologetically promote a neo-Nazi\u2019s propaganda on Twitter without real political consequence. Over the past month, none of King\u2019s fellow Republicans have pushed to censure him or expel him from Congress. None have called for him to resign. Mostly, they have stayed\u00a0quiet.\u00a0\nRepublicans have rebuked King in the past, sometimes forcefully. But they\u2019ve also never really punished him, and have been inclined to\u00a0give him the benefit of the doubt. (\u201cI\u2019d like to think he misspoke,\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan once said after King tweeted: \u201cwe can\u2019t restore our civilization with other people\u2019s babies.\u201d King later clarified\u00a0that he had not misspoken, and had \u201cmeant exactly\u201d what he said.)\u00a0\nKing is still chair of the House subcommittee on the constitution and civil justice. He still sits in the subcommittee on immigration and border security. He\u2019s still co-chair of Republican Kim Reynolds\u2019 gubernatorial campaign in Iowa. Over the past month, he\u2019s received thousands of dollars in campaign donations, including from Koch Industries PAC. And come time for the 2020 presidential election, Republican candidates will likely come begging for his endorsement, just as they did\u00a0in the last election.\u00a0\nAlthough the National Republican Congressional Committee, the Republican National Committee and Republican politicians have taken time to denounce or un-endorse the frightening number of neo-Nazis, Holocaust deniers and other assorted white supremacists running for office as Republicans this year, they\u2019ve remained silent about King, helping to normalize his ideas and deem them acceptable.\nWhen a HuffPost reporter on Capitol Hill Tuesday asked King about his retweet of a neo-Nazi, the congressman said all of his tweets are \u201ctrue and objective.\u201d\u00a0On Wednesday, when the same reporter asked King if he is a white supremacist or a white nationalist, the congressman didn\u2019t deny the allegation.\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t answer those questions,\u201d he said. \u201cI say to people that use those kind of allegations: Use those words a million times, because you\u2019re reducing the value of them every time, and many of the people that use those words and make those allegations and ask those questions can\u2019t even define the words they\u2019re using.\u201d\u00a0\nSo we have defined the words, and all the evidence is there: King is a white supremacist.\nWhite nationalism is aimed at preserving or maintaining a white majority in the U.S., said Jessie Daniels, a sociology professor at the City University of New York, HuffPost columnist and author of the books White Lies\u00a0and Cyber Racism.\nDaniels said King \u201cdefinitely\u201d qualifies as a white nationalist. \u201cHe\u2019s been upfront about the fact that those are his views,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u00a0\nKing is obsessed, for example, with demographics \u2014 and the perceived threat Muslim and Latino immigrants pose to the white, Christian majority. For this reason, King has taken particular interest in Geert Wilders, a noxiously Islamophobic Dutch politician who has advocated for fascist anti-Muslim policies, including a ban on Muslim immigration, and a\u00a0ban on all mosques and Qurans in the Netherlands.\nKing visited Wilders in the Netherlands earlier this month, posing with him in a photo outside the U.S. embassy. Last year,\u00a0King tweeted a photo of himself standing proudly with Wilders. \u201cCultural suicide by demographic transformation must end,\u201d the tweet said.\u00a0\nThat tweet led him to appear on CNN, where he stated, \u201cWe need to get our birth rates up or Europe will be entirely transformed.\u201d He then defended the tweet again on an Iowa radio station, recommending that listeners read The Camp of Saints,\u00a0a\u00a0racist\u00a0French novel that depicts black and brown immigrants descending upon Europe like a plague.\nKing himself has a history of making his own wildly anti-Muslim proclamations. Just last month, speaking on Breitbart radio, King said that he didn\u2019t want Somali Muslims working in Iowa\u2019s meatpacking plants. Muslims often don\u2019t eat pork, and in King\u2019s twisted interpretation of Islam, the only reason Muslims would want to handle pork at meatpacking plants is to send non-Muslims \u201cto Hell\u201d and \u201cmake Allah happy.\u201d \nKing has said the U.S. government should spy on mosques and that Muslims should have to renounce Sharia law before entering the country. \nAnd he once promoted a debunked and paranoid conspiracy theory \u2014 from the extremist conspiracy theory website InfoWars \u2014 that a Jerusalem imam told Muslims to \u201cgo into Western Europe, build your enclaves there, breed their women, and do not associate or assimilate into the broader society.\u201d\nKing has similarly devoted much of his career to vilifying Latino immigrants as inherently criminal and threatening. \nLast month, responding to a tweet showing a photo of young Latino boys detained at the border and forcibly separated from their families, King tweeted, \u201d\u2018Young boys\u2019 all old enough to be tried as adults or serve in the military and are prime MS-13 gang material & certainly grew up in the culture of one of the top 10 most violent countries in the world.\u201d\nKing has made the wildly false claim that over a quarter of violent crimes in the U.S. are committed by undocumented immigrants, and has referred to illegal immigration as a \u201cslow-motion terrorist attack in the United States\u201d and a \u201cslow-motion holocaust.\u201d (Undocumented immigrants commit less crime than native-born Americans.)\u00a0\nHe once, while proposing an electrified fence along the Mexican border, compared immigrants to \u201clivestock.\u201d\u00a0\nShane Burley, author of the 2017 book Fascism Today: What It Is and How to End It, prefers to call King a white supremacist, which he defines as someone who wants to \u201ccontinue the idea of white dominance.\u201d Burley reserves the label white nationalist for those who advocate explicitly for a whites-only country or ethnostate, something King has never done. \nStill, Burley told HuffPost, King \u201cserves white nationalists\u2019 goals, whether or not that\u2019s his ideology. He functionally is their ally. He is absolutely an agent of them.\u201d \n\u201cThe GOP openly flirts with white nationalists at any point it can,\u201d Burley added, and no other Republican is a bigger flirt than King. \nIn 2012, King appeared on a Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) panel called the \u201cThe Failure of Multiculturalism\u201d with three white nationalists: Bob Vandervoort, John Derbyshire\u00a0and Peter Brimelow. \n\u201cI\u2019ve read all your books!\u201d King excitedly told Brimelow, according to a BuzzFeed report at the time. \nBrimelow\u2019s most well-known book, Alien Nation,\u00a0argues that \u201crace is destiny\u201d in the U.S., and that the country has always had a \u201cwhite, ethnic core\u201d that needs to be preserved. \nBrimelow \u2014 who hangs out with white ethnostate enthusiasts like Richard Spencer and Jared Taylor \u2014 also runs VDARE.com, a site named after Virginia Dare, said to be the first\u00a0white baby born in the New World. The site regularly publishes the work of racists and anti-Semites. King\u2019s official House of Representatives website includes a page dedicated to \u201cIllegal Immigrant Stories,\u201d one of which links to an article on VDARE.\u00a0\nOn Twitter, King follows 164 accounts, most of them belonging to Donald Trump cheerleaders, fellow Republicans and dubious anti-immigration sites like Voice of Europe.\nBut HuffPost has found he also follows a handful of accounts belonging to unabashed\u00a0white supremacists, including Blair Cottrell, a violent Australian activist who\u2019s called for hanging a picture of Adolf Hitler in every classroom; Stefan Molyneux, a Canadian alt-right vlogger who thinks whites are more intelligent than blacks; and an anonymous Twitter user (with only 334 followers) using the handle @DiezNewAge, who regularly tweets out anti-Semitic and anti-black messages.\nKing also uses white supremacist slogans. \u201cDiversity is not our strength,\u201d he tweeted in December 2017, linking to an article on the website Voice of Europe about Hungary\u2019s far-right prime minister saying that \u201cmixing cultures will not lead to a higher quality of life but a lower one.\u201d\nKing did not come up with the phrase \u201cdiversity is not our strength.\u201d As HuffPost has reported, white supremacists have been saying it for years.\nDavid Neiwert, author of Alt-America: The Rise of the Radical Right In The Age Of Trump,\u00a0said he is \u201cinclined to consider King a white supremacist.\u201d Neiwert told HuffPost white supremacy is typically obsessed with \u201ceugenicist \u2018race science\u2019 and similar, often cruder, expressions of contempt for nonwhites.\u201d \nKing expressed this kind of contempt on national television in 2016 when he appeared as a guest on an MSNBC panel about the racial makeup of the Republican Party. During the discussion, a guest argued, correctly, that the Republican leadership is overwhelmingly white. King interjected, arguing that white people made more \u201ccontributions\u201d to \u201ccivilization\u201d than \u201cany other subgroup.\u201d \nHe later defended the remarks. \u201cThe idea of multiculturalism and that every culture is equal \u2014 that\u2019s not objectively true,\u201d King told The Washington Post. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve been fed that information for the last 25 years in this country. And we\u2019re not going to continue to become a greater nation if we don\u2019t look at this objectively.\u201d\nKing has also paid homage to more traditional forms of American white supremacy. He has said the U.S. should not apologize for centuries of enslaving, murdering and raping millions of black Americans. He came out against\u00a0putting a picture of emancipator Harriet Tubman \u2014 a conductor of the Underground Railroad \u2014 on the $20 bill. \nAnd he once kept a Confederate flag on his desk even though his home state of Iowa was not part of the Confederacy. In fact, Iowa sent thousands of soldiers to fight for the Union against the Confederacy \u2014 a treasonous army fighting explicitly to protect the institution of slavery in the South. \nLast month, King won the Republican primary in Iowa\u2019s Fourth Congressional District, ensuring he\u2019ll be on the ballot this November in the general election against Democrat J.D. Scholten. \u00a0\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee, which doles out cash to Republican candidates around the country, did not respond to a HuffPost request for comment on whether it plans to allocate funds for King\u2019s campaign, or whether it\u2019d be endorsing King\u2019s campaign. It also did not respond to a request for comment on King retweeting a neo-Nazi.\nThe Republican National Committee, which also coordinates fundraising for candidates, did not respond to a request for comment about King\u2019s tweet. \u00a0\nA spokesperson for the campaign to elect Reynolds as governor of Iowa did not respond to a HuffPost request for comment as to whether King should remain co-chair of Reynolds\u2019 campaign.\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) \u2014 who last week condemned the Republican congressional campaign of neo-Nazi Arthur Jones \u2014 did not respond to a request for comment about King\u2019s neo-Nazi tweet. King was chair of Cruz\u2019s presidential campaign in 2016.\u00a0\nThe office of Speaker Ryan initially\u00a0did not respond to a request for comment\u00a0on King\u2019s tweet. After two weeks, his spokeswoman AshLee Strong issued a statement to reporters that did not specifically condemn King. \u201cThe speaker has said many times that Nazis have no place in our politics, and clearly members should not engage with anyone promoting hate,\u201d she said.\n(\u201cPaul Ryan didn\u2019t say anything,\u201d\u00a0King\u00a0told CNN\u00a0in response.\u00a0\u201cHis spokesman made a general comment that didn\u2019t even have my name in it.\u201d) \u00a0\nStrong did not respond to a HuffPost question as to whether King should face any consequences for retweeting a neo-Nazi.\nKing meanwhile, like so many white supremacists on Twitter, won\u2019t stop tweeting.\nLast week, he once again tweeted: \u201cEurope is waking up\u2026 will America\u2026 in time?\u201d \u2014\u00a0word-for-word\u00a0the same tweet he published last month while linking to a tweet from neo-Nazi Mark Collett.\nOnly this time, King linked to a tweet from Charlie Kirk, head of the right-wing young Republican organization, Turning Points USA. Kirk\u2019s tweet cited a\u00a0false statistic\u00a0about migrant rapes in Denmark.\nZo\u00e9 Samudzi, co-author of the book As Black As Resistance, says King is a white nationalist and sees a couple possible explanations for why the GOP is so quiet about King. \nRepublicans, she told HuffPost, either see King as \u201ca problem and are too afraid of bucking party convention\u201d to denounce him. Or \u201cthey\u2019re similarly invested in the politics that he holds.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the latter,\u201d she said.", "date": "\n07/19/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/steve-king-white-nationalist_n_5b3276f0e4b0b745f1784ebe", "tags": "steve \u201c tweet gop neo-nazi white supremacist republican king huffpost \u2014 care"}
