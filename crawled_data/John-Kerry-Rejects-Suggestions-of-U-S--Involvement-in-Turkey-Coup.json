Mr. Gulen has denied the charge, and Mr. Kerry said the Justice Department would examine any evidence Turkey presented as part of an extradition request.\nSuleyman Soylu, Turkey\u2019s labor minister, had accused the United States of being behind the coup. In a phone call on Saturday with the Turkish foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, Mr. Kerry urged restraint by the Turkish government and said that \u201cpublic insinuations or claims about any role by the United States in the failed coup attempt are utterly false and harmful to our bilateral relations,\u201d according to a description of the call released by the State Department.\nOn Sunday, Mr. Kerry expressed concerns that Mr. Erdogan might use the coup to undertake a wide-ranging purge within the government of those who may disagree with him.\n\u201cObviously, there are coup plotters, and the coup plotters need to be held accountable and they will be,\u201d Mr. Kerry said on ABC. \u201cBut I think we\u2019re all concerned, and we have expressed that concern, that this not fuel a reach well beyond those who engaged in the coup but that they strengthen the democracy of the country, strengthen the process, and use it as a moment to unite the nation.\u201d\nOn NBC, Mr. Kerry said an extensive purge \u201cwould be a great challenge to his relationship to Europe, to NATO and to all of us, and we have urged them not to reach out so far that they\u2019re creating doubts about their commitment to the democratic process, and I hope it won\u2019t result in that.\u201d", "date": "July 17, 2016", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/18/world/europe/john-kerry-rejects-suggestions-of-us-involvement-in-turkey-coup.html", "tags": "turkey coup u.s. united states kerry \u201d suggestions involvement rejects john government"}
