{"title": "Treasury Dept. Declines House Request for Trump\u2019s Tax Returns", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Treasury Department said on Wednesday evening that it would not immediately comply with a congressional request to hand over President Trump\u2019s tax returns, setting up a protracted legal battle between two branches of government.\nSteven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said in a letter to Representative Richard E. Neal, the Democratic chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, that the Treasury Department\u2019s lawyers needed more time to assess the lawfulness of the request and expressed concern that it would be a violation of taxpayer privacy.\nMr. Mnuchin did not say how much time the review would take but conveyed concerns about whether Congress has authority to review the records.\n\u201cThe committee\u2019s request raises serious issues concerning the constitutional investigative authority, the legitimacy of the asserted legislative purpose and the constitutional rights of American citizens,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin wrote. \u201cThe legal implications of this request could affect protections for all Americans against politically motivated disclosures of tax information, regardless of which party is in power.\u201d\nMr. Neal responded to Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s decision with a terse statement that indicated he believed the request was a matter for the Internal Revenue Service, not the Treasury secretary: \u201cI will consult with counsel and determine the appropriate response to the commissioner in the coming days.\u201d\nMr. Neal is expected to send a follow-up letter demanding the tax returns and outlining potential next steps, which could include a subpoena or a lawsuit. The issue could ultimately be decided by the Supreme Court.\nMr. Trump said on Wednesday that he would not turn over his tax returns because they remained under audit by the I.R.S., signaling a long fight ahead.\nThe president, who has used the excuse of an I.R.S. audit since the 2016 presidential campaign, made clear he would continue to cite that as a reason not to release his tax records, even though no law prevents a taxpayer from releasing returns while under audit.\n\u201cI would love to give them, but I\u2019m not going to do it while I\u2019m under audit,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters before departing for a trip to Texas. \u201cI have no obligation to do that while under audit and no lawyer would tell you to release your tax returns while you\u2019re under audit.\u201d\nMr. Trump\u2019s Treasury Department was facing a midnight deadline to respond to a letter sent last week by Mr. Neal, who issued a formal request for six years of Mr. Trump\u2019s personal and business tax records.\nWhite House officials have called the request a political fishing expedition, and Mr. Mnuchin has said that furnishing the returns could open the floodgates to weaponizing the Internal Revenue Service.\nMr. Mnuchin signaled his intention on Tuesday, when he told members of Congress that the president had no legal obligation to make his tax returns public. While Mr. Mnuchin insisted that he would follow the law, he also defended Mr. Trump\u2019s right to keep his tax returns private.\nMr. Mnuchin reiterated his position that the privacy of taxpayers, including that of the president, was paramount during a moderated discussion on Wednesday at the International Monetary Fund.\n\u201cWe are going to respond carefully. We need to make sure that the I.R.S. and individual taxpayer information does not just become subject to political winds,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said, adding that he had been consulting with the Justice Department on the matter. \u201cWhether it is this party or a different party over time, I take the obligation very seriously to make sure that we follow the law correctly.\u201d\nBut the provision in tax law that Democrats are using appears to give the Trump administration little leeway to resist their request; it says merely that the Treasury secretary \u201cshall\u201d furnish the requested information. It was used several times by House Republicans when they were investigating whether the I.R.S. had improperly delayed applications by conservative groups for nonprofit status.\nSome Democrats quickly denounced the Treasury Department\u2019s decision on Wednesday.\n\u201cHow many lawyers and how much time does it take for Secretary Mnuchin to understand that \u2018shall\u2019 means \u2018shall\u2019?\u201d said Representative Lloyd Doggett of Texas, a member of the Ways and Means Committee. \u201cAgain, believing that he is above the law, Trump is engaged in obstruction.\u201d\nRepublicans praised Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s caution and lashed out at Democrats for what they said was an abuse of power.\n\u201cAmericans didn\u2019t elect their members of Congress to go to Washington to try to dig up harmful information on their political opponents,\u201d said Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. \u201cIt should be alarming to every American that there are attempts by elected officials to weaponize the I.R.S. for partisan political purposes.\u201d\nMr. Mnuchin acknowledged that White House lawyers had been in touch with the Treasury Department about the matter before Mr. Neal made his formal request last week. Mr. Mnuchin said he had not personally spoken to Mr. Trump about the request.\nAs a candidate, Mr. Trump promised on many occasions that he would release his returns when the I.R.S. finished an audit of his taxes. Declining to release the returns broke with decades of precedent.\nCharles P. Rettig, the I.R.S. commissioner, said Tuesday at a congressional hearing that no rules prohibited taxpayers who are under audit from releasing their tax returns.\nThe tax returns of presidents are automatically audited. After Democrats took control of the House this year, Mr. Neal decided to use a provision in the tax code that allows the chairman of the tax writing committee to gain access to the returns of any taxpayer. Mr. Neal said Mr. Trump\u2019s returns were needed so the committee could assess how the I.R.S. was auditing presidential returns.\nRepublicans have argued that this rationale is suspect, pointing out that Democrats only asked for Mr. Trump\u2019s returns and that there are other methods that could be used to study the auditing practices at the I.R.S.\nAlthough he has said he would rely on the advice of his department\u2019s lawyers when deciding, Mr. Mnuchin, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most loyal aides, has been widely expected to fight to keep the tax returns secret.\nIn his letter, the Treasury secretary said he would be personally overseeing the matter.", "date": "April 10, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/us/politics/trump-tax-returns-treasury.html", "tags": "tax declines treasury \u201d house dept trump returns mnuchin request"}
