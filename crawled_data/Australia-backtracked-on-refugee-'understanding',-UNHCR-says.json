{"title": "Australia backtracked on refugee 'understanding', UNHCR says", "content": "The UN's refugee agency has accused Australia of reneging on an agreement to reunite some refugees with relatives already living in the nation.\nThe \"clear understanding\" had been part of a wider deal to resettle refugees in the US, the agency said.\nIt said Australia had recently backed out of that understanding. Australia has said no such promise ever existed.\nThe UN agency said Australia's long-held policy of detaining asylum seekers offshore had caused \"extensive\" harm.\nAustralia has controversially refused to accept asylum seekers and refugees, most of whom are men from Iran, Afghanistan and Iraq, and instead holds them in centres on the Pacific nations of Nauru and Papua New Guinea.\nThe government has said its policy disrupts people smuggling and prevents deaths at sea.\nOn Monday, the UN high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR), Filippo Grandi, said Australia had only recently confirmed that it would not take refugees with existing close family ties.\n\"This means, for example, that some with serious medical conditions, or who have undergone traumatic experiences, including sexual violence, cannot receive the support of their close family members residing in Australia,\" he said.\nHowever, the Australian government denied it had offered to accept any of the refugees, saying its policy had been \"clear and consistent\".\n\"Those transferred to RPCs [regional processing centres] will never settle in Australia,\" a government spokesperson told the BBC.\nUnder existing agreements, refugees have the possibility of settling only in Nauru, Papua New Guinea, the US, Cambodia, or another nation where they are eligible to live.\nMr Grandi said reuniting families was \"the humane and reasonable thing to do\".\n\"The Australian government's decision to deny them this possibility is contrary to the fundamental principles of family unity and refugee protection, and to common decency,\" he said.\nMany people had suffered \"physical and psychological harm\" since Australia introduced its current policy in 2013, he added.\nIn April, the US confirmed it would go through with a deal to resettle up to 1,250 refugees - which Australia had arranged with the Obama administration.\nUS President Donald Trump had called the deal \"dumb\" following a phone call with Australian PM Malcolm Turnbull.", "date": "25 July 2017", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-40712522", "tags": "policy un australia unhcr us refugee agency backtracked says refugees government deal family"}
