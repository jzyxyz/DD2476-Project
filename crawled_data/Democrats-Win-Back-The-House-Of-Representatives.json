{"title": "Democrats Win Back The House Of Representatives", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2015 After eight unforgiving years in the minority, Democrats will once again control the House of Representatives, with a deeply divided nation handing their party a narrow advantage of around 10 seats in the House.\nIt wasn\u2019t quite the wave that Democrats were hoping for. Even with a 9-point advantage in the popular vote, Republicans fended off the worst-case scenarios in the House and actually improved their majority in the Senate, as Indiana, Missouri and Florida \u2015 states that voted for President Donald Trump in 2016 \u2015 sent their Democratic senators packing.\nBut both parties will still be able to claim victories Tuesday. Democrats picking up the House effectively slows Trump\u2019s presidency to a legislative crawl, while Republicans will point to their gains in the Senate to say voters still prefer their stark vision of governance.\nIn fact, one of the major lessons for Republicans may be that they need to embrace Trump\u2019s style even more. A blue wave for Democrats never really materialized because Republicans were able to energize their own voters through a campaign full of racial anxiety and culture war items.\nEven with Democrats looking likely to pick up around 30 seats in the House, it\u2019s perhaps most notable how many GOP members were able to survive. It took Republicans trying to undermine popular protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions, the passage of an unpopular tax cut bill, and the reality of Trump for Democrats to recapture the House \u2015 and Democrats were only able to barely achieve that goal.\nWhere Democrats did pick up seats, their gains were mostly in areas where Hillary Clinton had already beaten Donald Trump in 2016, though Democrats did flip districts all across the nation.\u00a0They took three seats in Virginia, three seats in Pennsylvania, two seats in Texas, and a smattering of seats from New York, Iowa, Illinois and New Jersey \u2015 with dozens of races to still be called.\nDemocrats also had a few upsets on the night, flipping the Trump-friendly area of Staten Island and even a district in long-red Oklahoma. But their gains were mostly in the suburban, affluent, educated areas that Democrats have already increasingly turned blue.\nThe primary message from Democrats during the 2018 campaign \u2015 that they would protect health care for the sick while Republicans would undermine it \u2015 did seem to resonate across the country. Democrats used almost every opportunity they could to redirect conversations back to health care. They also channeled frustration with a historically unpopular president into grassroots energy that propelled them back to power in a number of districts that Democrats haven\u2019t represented in years, in some cases decades, like the Virginia district where Democrat Abigail Spanberger defeated Republican Dave Brat in a district that a Democrat hasn\u2019t represented since 1970.\nBut again, Republicans kept the majority of their tossup seats by appealing to their GOP base voters. In states like Florida where Republicans could have lost a number of seats, the GOP ended up only losing in areas where Democrats were already popular. A governor\u2019s race that pitted the Democratic base\u2019s energy \u2015 channeled into candidate Andrew Gillum \u2015 against Trump\u2019s base, with Republican candidate Ron DeSantis, showed that Republicans had the advantage.\nRepublicans had initially tried a different messaging strategy. They tried to sell their tax cut package as a major victory for voters, arguing that the strong economy was a byproduct of their policies. \nBut with polls consistently showing the legislation\u2019s popularity in the low 40s, Republicans eventually began campaigning on the more culture war-ish, racially tinged messages that kept a wave at bay. \nThe GOP bet it could withstand the worst effects of a Democratic wave by embracing Trump\u2019s playbook and exciting their own voters \u2015 and Republicans were mostly right.\nStill, recapturing the House is a huge achievement for Democrats as they look to curb the worst effects of Trump\u2019s presidency.\nDemocrats almost certainly won\u2019t go along with GOP attempts to gut the Affordable Care Act. They likely won\u2019t make the tax cuts permanent as Republicans want. And \u2015 as was already the case \u2015 they won\u2019t give Trump his signature border wall without major concessions on the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals program.\nInstead, Democrats have said, they\u2019ll put forward an infrastructure package meant to tempt some moderate Republicans and the president. They\u2019ll offer their own legislation on DACA and dare Trump to oppose it. And they\u2019ll conduct more rigorous oversight of the president, though there are already questions about how far Democrats would push possible impeachment proceedings.\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has made it clear that, under her leadership, impeaching Trump is \u201cnot a priority.\u201d But that could change with new revelations from the Robert Mueller investigation or from congressional oversight \u2015 and Pelosi\u2019s position as the top Democrat in the House isn\u2019t certain either.\nA number of the Democrats who won Tuesday \u2015 including Spanberger in Virginia,\u00a0Jason Crow in Colorado, Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey and Anthony Brindisi in New York\u00a0\u2015 have said they won\u2019t support Pelosi to be the next speaker. And with what could still be a narrow majority for Democrats, Pelosi\u2019s grip on the speaker\u2019s gavel is very loose. She\u2019s long faced pressure from existing Democrats in her caucus \u2015 such as Tim Ryan of Ohio, Seth Moulton of Massachusetts and Jim Cooper of Tennessee \u2015 to relinquish her position as the No. 1 Democrat in the House.\nUltimately, whether Pelosi can become speaker again will depend on the exact composition of the House and whether she can get some Democrats to go back on the soft promises they made to their constituents that they would not support her for speaker.\nThere were still a number of races to be decided and called as of late Tuesday night, including most of the close California races. Many of those tossups will be crucial to determining the exact majority for Democrats and whether Pelosi can hold onto her position.", "date": "\n11/07/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/democrats-house-win_n_5be1fc28e4b0e84388909931?nuo", "tags": "democrats seats win voters gop back house \u2015 pelosi republicans representatives still"}
