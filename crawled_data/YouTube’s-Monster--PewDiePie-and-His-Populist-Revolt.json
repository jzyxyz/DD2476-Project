{"title": "YouTube\u2019s Monster: PewDiePie and His Populist Revolt", "content": "[Here\u2019s what we know about the shootings at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand in March, 2019. The gunman began a video by saying \u201csubscribe to PewDiePie\u201d \u2014 a kind of \u201call-purpose cultural bat signal for the young and extremely online.\u201d]\nFelix Kjellberg, known to his fans as PewDiePie, is by far YouTube\u2019s biggest star. His videos, a mix of video-game narration, humorous rants and commentary, have cumulatively been viewed billions of times, and more than 53 million people subscribe to his channel. He has been called \u201cthe king of YouTube\u201d and countless variations thereon, and he has remained unchallenged on that perch for years, making millions of dollars and leveraging his popularity into outside ventures.\nBut Monday night, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Disney-owned Maker Studios, a longtime partner of Kjellberg\u2019s, would no longer have anything to do with him; later, YouTube announced that it was canceling a show developed with Kjellberg, and removing his channel from its lucrative \u201cGoogle Preferred\u201d advertising program. At issue was a series of recent comedy videos. In one, he found performers on the freelance site Fiverr willing to dance and hold up a sign of the client\u2019s choosing. He asked them to write \u201cDeath to all Jews,\u201d and they did; in his subsequent video, he expressed shock that the request had made it through. \u201cIt was a funny meme, and I didn\u2019t think it would work,\u201d he said, mock-begging news outlets not to make too much of his stunt. \u201cI swear, I love Jews,\u201d he said, \u201cI love them,\u201d before playing a few notes on a kazoo.\nAs he anticipated, plenty of news outlets saw a story in his antics. Others saw something more. A post on The Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi site, marveled at Kjellberg\u2019s performances, and wondered in disbelief if they might signal sympathy for its ideology. \u201cUltimately, it doesn\u2019t matter, since the effect is the same,\u201d the post said, \u201cit normalizes Nazism, and marginalizes our enemies.\u201d As the controversy mounted, Kjellberg denounced the \u201chate-based groups\u201d that had taken notice of his videos. \u201cI was trying to show how crazy the modern world is, specifically some of the services available online,\u201d he said in a Feb. 12 Tumblr post. \u201cI think of the content that I create as entertainment, and not a place for any serious political commentary. I know my audience understand that, and that is why they come to my channel.\u201d This explanation, unsurprisingly, did not satisfy Maker Studios, or, for that matter, Google.\nIt\u2019s tempting to write off this scandal as an inscrutable product of a teen subculture, wrapped up in layers of irony and the peculiar language and aesthetics of YouTube. It is likewise easy to frame the episode as an isolated collision between offensive speech and careful sponsors. But it\u2019s most useful to understand Kjellberg\u2019s meltdown in the context of the vast platform on which it took place \u2014 YouTube \u2014 and the nascent strains of politics that could come to define it.\nWith more than a billion users, YouTube has become not merely a platform but almost a kind of internet nation-state: the host of a gigantic economy and a set of cultures governed by a new and novel sort of corporation, sometimes at arm\u2019s length and other times up close. It\u2019s a system Kjellberg has spent recent months antagonizing in a broader and less-inflammatory way, even as he continued to thrive within it. He bemoaned its structure and the way it had changed; he balked at its limits and took joy in causing offense and flouting rules. Over time, he grew into an unlikely, disorienting and insistently unserious political identity: He became YouTube\u2019s very own populist reactionary.\nIn December 2016, Kjellberg\u2019s account was about to pass 50 million subscribers \u2014 a milestone, and a record. But in his videos, he seemed to be ending the year on a pessimistic note. \u201cIt\u2019s time for me to complain about YouTube,\u201d he said in a video. \u201cAgain.\u201d The platform, he suggested, had changed in a way that he found worrying, and maybe punitive. Subscriptions are the fundamental organizing principle of YouTube \u2013 akin to a Twitter feed, they deliver to users exactly what they\u2019ve signed up to see \u2013 but, Kjellberg said, they were becoming less important to the way viewers found videos. What YouTube was doing instead, he claimed, was packing people\u2019s feeds with material they didn\u2019t care about, from channels they\u2019d never subscribed to. His viewership numbers had suffered as a result, he said. His rant spiraled on from there, swerving among resentment and self-deprecation, grievance and absurdity, toying with both revolutionary and reactionary tropes, and ending where it had begun: with a threat to close his account.\nIt might seem hard to believe that anyone would want to watch a YouTube video complaining about YouTube\u2019s internal economic politics, but more than 20 million people did (the video\u2019s title, \u201cDELETING MY CHANNEL AT 50 MILLION,\u201d surely helped). For years now, in fact, YouTube has been one of Kjellberg\u2019s most-addressed subjects, second only perhaps to video games. In September, he even collapsed the distinction between the two, releasing a smartphone game called Tuber Simulator. The object is to become a famous YouTube star. Players begin their careers in a dank, windowless room and scrounge for views and cash, with videos like \u201cBikini Wax Your Pets\u201d and \u201cGO Outside \u2013 Walkthrough,\u201d the latter a play on a common form of video-game vlog. It\u2019s both an extended joke about making money online and a functioning, moneymaking app. \u201cIf the intention was to make a biting critique of late capitalism, Pewdiepie and Outerminds have wildly succeeded,\u201d  Gita Jackson wrote for the gaming site Kotaku. \u201cBut if not,\u201d she continued, \u201cthe game still gets there by accident.\u201d\nFor product reviewers and gamers, for the unboxers and the how-to teachers, for the interchannel drama analysts, the bloggers, the makeup artists and the pranksters, YouTube looms large not just as a context but also as a character. The daily exigencies of life on YouTube are perhaps the only subject that cuts across every major YouTube category. Showbiz loves to make movies about showbiz, and television loves to make television about TV. YouTube has simply democratized this impulse.\nIt makes sense that YouTube would become home to such a performatively self-aware economy. It is, after all, one of the most mature of the major social platforms. It is extremely culturally productive, and can claim genuine stars as its own. Above all, it pays. And in the people who depend on the platform to pay their bills, it inspires a peculiar mixture of paranoia, desire, gratefulness and disdain that shows up clearly in their work. YouTube\u2019s peculiar relationship with the economy within it is fraught, promising and poorly understood. It\u2019s also unique among social-media platforms \u2014 but maybe not for much longer. For now, most of the biggest internet platforms are understood as venues for communication, expression and consumption. YouTube has given us a glimpse at what happens when users start associating social platforms with something more: livelihoods.\nWatch enough YouTube programming on any subject and you\u2019ll gradually come to understand the struggles of starting and maintaining a channel. You\u2019ll become familiar with the mementos Google sends creators at subscriber milestones \u2014 a silver \u201cplay\u201d button at 100,000, around which time your favorite YouTubers might start talking about quitting their day jobs, and a gold one at a million, when they are more to likely have done so. You\u2019ll hear plenty about conversations with YouTube support, many of which contradict one another. You\u2019ll develop opinions about YouTube\u2019s copyright rules, age restrictions and advertising policies. You\u2019ll get an intuitive sense of the YouTube attention marketplace and how people try to take advantage of it, and you\u2019ll hear about advertising rates. You\u2019ll hear conspiracy theories \u2014 some rooted in daily shared YouTube experience, others rooted in less visible fears, desires and resentments \u2014 some of which gain considerable traction.\nAnd why shouldn\u2019t you? YouTubers are not employed by YouTube, but they are paid by YouTube, because it matches their videos, automatically, with advertisers. The platform and the video-makers share a clear and common goal: to persuade audiences to watch more videos in order to make more money from ads. But even with a unifying cause, creators inevitably discover smaller ways in which their goals and YouTube\u2019s are at odds. It is in YouTube creators\u2019 interest, for example, to understand the best practices for getting the most YouTube subscribers, or the best strategies for making videos that YouTube might algorithmically recommend. But it is in YouTube\u2019s interest for the inner workings of its platform \u2014 including recommendation algorithms, the way it calculates advertising rates and the precise locations of its boundaries \u2014 to remain at least somewhat secret, to prevent creators from gaming the platform\u2019s quirks at the expense of either YouTube\u2019s user experience or its bottom line. Criticism from its creators is one of the many things YouTube tolerates to maintain this arrangement, which is otherwise clearly working to their benefit.\nEmergent politics of social platforms differ in scope and character and sit along peculiar axes, some familiar, others new. On Twitter, which does not pay popular users, they revolve around matters of speech and harassment; the platform hosts a range of progressive movements as well as an extremely visible and openly racist reactionary movement, and they have been at war. On Facebook, which is bigger and less combative, they focus on censorship and governance. But on any major platform, they tend to grow from the same fertile place: the gap between the structures built by the company and what users are allowed to do within them. Inevitably, this leads users to fundamental political questions: Who gets what, and why? Who gets to do what, and why?\nKjellberg\u2019s December video drew responses from other YouTubers, debunking or explaining or affirming the claim by YouTube\u2019s biggest star that the platform just wasn\u2019t what it used to be, some gathering millions of views of their own. In retrospect, though, one brief moment in the original video was especially notable. As he wound down his rant, he hinted at a different sense of victimhood, drawing from the same sense of umbrage but directing it in a startling direction. After criticizing the platform for not understanding the realities of working on YouTube and wondering aloud if he was being punished, or somehow demoted, he affected a sincere voice and said, \u201cI\u2019m white.\u201d\n\u201cCan I make that comment? But I do think that\u2019s a problem,\u201d he continued, before a smash-cut and a return to a mocking rant about not letting YouTube win \u2014 another assurance to viewers that, as always, he was just kidding, and that the offensiveness of the prior claim was the reason he\u2019d made it.\nHere, again, it is helpful to situate Kjellberg properly. He initially rose to popularity within the video-gaming subculture, which, beginning with the \u201cGamerGate\u201d movement and continuing through the American presidential election, became surprisingly and darkly politicized. His core audience is young, and his sensibility clearly appeals to a masculine teenage impulse to shock and provoke. The YouTube platform plainly incentivizes such attention-grabbing behavior, right up until the point that it becomes a liability to its operators or their other partners \u2014 a familiar dilemma in the entertainment world, sure, but one that plays out quite differently on YouTube, which is considerably and deliberately less hands-on with its talent. It\u2019s telling that YouTube\u2019s biggest star portrayed the platform as distant and capricious. It\u2019s alarming that following his performative hostility led him to where it did: attempting to rationalize the use of anti-Semitic speech under the guise of transgression.\nKjellberg had, either instinctively or intentionally, constructed a political identity as YouTube\u2019s insider class-traitor, raging against a system that\u2019s \u2014 trust him, but also he\u2019s just joking, but he would know \u2014 totally rigged. Now he is sketching out what a far more toxic YouTube politics of ressentiment might look like, under the threadbare cover of ironic bigotry, the recent history of which is worryingly instructive. In the meantime, the self-identified real racists are laughing along heartily, even as Kjellberg strenuously attempts to distance himself from them.\nMaker Studios, which seeks to create a sort of auxiliary production apparatus for YouTube, has less of a connection to the platform than any of the YouTubers it has partnered with, who belong much more to their audiences, and to YouTube. Its severing of ties, in the bigger context of YouTube, amounts to a disavowal. YouTube\u2019s reaction, and how it follows up, is the thing to watch. As, of course, is Kjellberg\u2019s. His most recent video, posted after Maker Studios and Google made their announcements, was a lighthearted play-through of a gag video game called \u201cGenital Jousting,\u201d and did not reference the scandal. His commenters, on the other hand, did, asking almost uniformly that he not apologize for anything.\nThe full character of the burgeoning politics of platforms remains to be seen. But right-wing movements have found early traction and see opportunity. Even as farce, Kjellberg\u2019s performance has been illustrative, and a small number of eager observers say they hope that, as backlash mounts, it will be galvanizing. \u201cIf Pewdiepie wasn\u2019t #AltRight before,\u201d Vox Day, a former video-game designer and an alt-right leader posted on Gab.ai, a private, Twitterlike service popular with the movement, \u201che is now.\u201d", "date": "Feb. 16, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/16/magazine/youtubes-monster-pewdiepie-and-his-populist-revolt.html", "tags": "pewdiepie youtube videos platform video \u201d one revolt kjellberg populist \u2014 monster"}
