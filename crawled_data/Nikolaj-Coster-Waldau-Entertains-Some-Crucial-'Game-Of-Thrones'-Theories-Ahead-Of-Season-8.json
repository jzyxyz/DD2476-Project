{"title": "Nikolaj Coster-Waldau Entertains Some Crucial 'Game Of Thrones' Theories Ahead Of Season 8", "content": "I tried to get Nikolaj Coster-Waldau on the phone for weeks.\nHe\u2019d been camping on ice caps in the idyllic Greenlander boonies ever since he wrapped filming on the highly anticipated final season\u00a0of \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d Meanwhile, I was tethered to the desk in my AC-blasted open-plan office, hopeful that Jaime Lannister would one day call me back. I had hope. Winter was everywhere.\n\u201cApparently, calling to the U.S. from Greenland is high risk,\u201d he told me when we finally connected over a restricted line earlier this month.\nIn reality, any conversation between a \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d star and a member of the press is high risk. Creators Dan Weiss and David Benioff run a tight ship now that the HBO fantasy series has soared past George R.R. Martin\u2019s \u201cSong of Ice and Fire\u201d books. Fans have never been as rabid as they are now, salivating over any small morsel of information offered about the show\u2019s mysterious Season 8.\u00a0\nAt this point, no one knows when the final episodes will drop. We just know the hype portends them to be more ostentatiously cinematic than any of the series\u2019 previous seasons.\u00a0\nAccording to our favorite 48-year-old Denmark native, the six-episode Season 8 arc was the most grueling shoot he\u2019s ever been a part of. \u201cI think if it hadn\u2019t have been the last season, people would\u2019ve just collapsed,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have made it. I mean, at one point the crew had 52 nights in one go in Northern Ireland. Just unheard of.\u201d\nSo maybe the ice-cap vacation was well deserved. Either way, here\u2019s our restricted-line phone conversation in full (though slightly edited for clarity), in which we talk about what he imagined happening in Season 7, what it was like to act out his last scene with Cersei and what he made of Gendry\u2019s inexplicably fast running.\nAnd yeah, he knows how the series ends and just won\u2019t tell us.\nAfter seven seasons of playing Jaime Lannister, you, my friend, finally received an Emmy nomination.\nI know. I wore them down, slowly but surely. [Laughs] No, I was very surprised and very happy.\nHow did it feel to see your name up there for the first time?\nI was on another trip in Greenland and I was standing in the airport with my two daughters and our two dogs and we\u2019d been rerouted. I was trying to persuade this cop to allow me to take the dogs out because they were about to ... I\u2019d say pee their pants, but they were ready to go. Then, I got the call [about the Emmys] and it was very confusing \u2014 a perfect way to find out. The cop then allowed the dogs to go out so it was a huge moment of joy for the dogs and for me. For different reasons, but we shared the joy.\nJust pure relief.\nTrue relief.\nYou\u2019re not only up against your brother, Tyrion Lannister, but Commander Waterford, Jim Hopper, Saul Berenson and Prince Philip. All these amazing supporting characters. Are you afraid of the competition?\nNo, no, no, no, should I be? I\u2019m thrilled!\nOn \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d we\u2019re such an ensemble cast and there\u2019s a feeling of \u201cwe\u2019re doing this together.\u201d So I see myself there representing the actors with [fellow nominees] Lena [Headey] and Peter [Dinklage], and I\u2019m just thrilled to be there. The other actors in the category are all tremendous, but I don\u2019t feel any anxiety or fear. Also, the show got 22 nominations! It really is the gift that keeps on giving. It\u2019s unbelievable.\nDo you think there\u2019s a scene from last season that solidified your place on the Emmys roster?\nI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve been getting to play in so many great scenes over the years and there were a couple of big scenes in Season 7. There was Diana Rigg\u2019s [Olenna Tyrell\u2019s] last scene, which was beautifully written. I forgot to mention that she\u2019s also nominated [for Guest Actress], which is very well deserved. And then my final scene with Lena [Cersei Lannister]. We\u2019ve built up to that for seven seasons so it was just a great way to end it. But I don\u2019t know! I think I\u2019m the wrong person to answer these things without sounding creepy or disgusting.\nYou\u2019ve just got to be into yourself, Nikolaj.\nYou just got to be into yourself and it\u2019s just, no, no. I\u2019m not.\u00a0\nIn all seriousness, that scene between Jaime and Cersei was one of the best of the entire series, let alone Season 7. How did it feel to read that finale script and realize how far Jaime had come to shut down Cersei for the first time?\nOne of the difficult things with this show as an actor \u2014 and I speak for myself \u2014 is, up until Season 3, I knew what was going to happen. Then, after that, the writers kept everything very close to the chest. They didn\u2019t share anything but the scripts. Now, of course, you use your imagination all the time, so I kept imagining what would happen after we finished the season. You build these whole storylines up and then suddenly you come back and you read the scripts and you go, \u201cOh, well, how am I going to do that? How am I going to get to that point?\u201d In my mind, after Season 6 \u2015 which ends with Jaime coming back [to King\u2019s Landing] and seeing Cersei on the throne \u2015 I imagined a lot of other things happening.\nDan and David have always played the long game the way they stretch things out, so when you get the payoff it really pays off. And we had a lot of almost heated discussions about how I was going to get to that point [with Cersei]. Like, [I asked], \u201cWhy don\u2019t they discuss in depth the death of their son [Tommen]?\u201d And they told me, \u201cWell they do, but we don\u2019t see that.\u201d So all those things. It\u2019s so much fun and difficult, and it\u2019s also very frustrating. But then when you finally find your way, it\u2019s very rewarding. For me, anyway.\nI\u2019m sure it\u2019s tricky navigating it all.\u00a0\nWhat I\u2019m saying though, is I thought that end scene in Season 7 would have happened before. For me, playing Jaime, when he gets to that point, it really was \u201cfinally!\u201d Finally he says no. Finally he stands up to her. It was such a brutal scene because they\u2019re playing two different games: Cersei\u2019s playing the game of thrones and Jaime\u2019s playing the honest game of survival, and trying to accommodate both his sister and his brother. I hope that makes sense?\u00a0\nIt makes perfect sense to me because just watching Season 7, it really did fly through so many storylines. I mean, Gendry\u2019s speed-running to the Wall alone threw everyone for a loop. Do you feel that\u2019s because the writers didn\u2019t have George R.R. Martin\u2019s books to really lean into for that exposition in the scripts like they\u2019ve had in the past?\nYou\u2019d have to ask Dan and David since it\u2019s their show. I think that they definitely spoke to George R.R. Martin a couple seasons back to hear how he imagined the ending to be. But it\u2019s not written, so it\u2019s one thing to have an idea but when you\u2019re writing it, it changes. Dan and David had a very specific end in sight and they also understand the fact that you don\u2019t want to overstay your welcome. \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d has been such a success for that reason \u2014 you know there\u2019s an end in sight and they\u2019re not going to stretch it out.\nBut yes, Joe Dempsie, who plays Gendry, is a very, very fit young man, so I\u2019m sure he can run that fast.\nVery fast. \nHe\u2019s a tremendous runner.\nSpeaking of Joe Dempsie, we interviewed him last year and he said he could actually be Cersei\u2019s legitimate son. Do you have thoughts on this theory?\nShe\u2019s been a busy bee, my dear sister. [Laughs] There are so many theories out there that you comment on one and then it takes on its own life. But, yes, I\u2019ve heard that Gendry [pause] ... I think Joe just wanted to get on the throne and that\u2019s why he\u2019s putting it out there.\nSpoilers are hard to come by, especially going into Season 8, but in the script for \u201cDragon and the Wolf\u201d it says Jaime is now \u201ca lone horseman heading north on the Kingsroad.\u201d So can we assume Jaime is heading north toward his brother, right?\nWell, he is heading north. I don\u2019t think you can assume that he\u2019s going to make it up there, but who knows. For sure, we see him head north. He might be eaten by dragons, you never know. Or he might just stumble, things happen. Or he might find the love of his life and suddenly he\u2019s like, \u201cGod, this is it. No more.\u201d\nWell, we hope you\u2019re heading north to be with Brienne! The true love of your life.\nOhhh, well, who knows? [Laughs] I don\u2019t, well, I know how it ends but ... no, I can\u2019t comment on that.\nYou did mention that Jaime sports a beard next season, so we know some things.\nWell, he\u2019s on the road for a while. Wherever he is going it takes some time, so his hair grows. He didn\u2019t bring a trimmer this year. He\u2019s always carried this little, neat, traveling trimmer, but he left that behind since it was a quick departure.\nHe forgot all his toiletries.\nYeah, all the basics.\nAs fans of Jaime\u2019s character arc, we are hoping you go fight with the good guys. And we have talked in the past about Valyrian steel and how Jaime is the owner of one of these deadly weapons.\nYes, you would think it\u2019d come in handy if you had to fight the White Walkers. It\u2019s true. But who knows.\nI just hope you don\u2019t stumble into a White Walker on your own when you\u2019re on the road\u2026\nWell he\u2019s got the Valyrian steel! He could\u2019ve made his hand into Valyrian steel instead of a gold hand \u2014 that would\u2019ve been clever.\nThat would\u2019ve been very smart! Or dragonglass, perhaps.\nExactly!\nWouldn\u2019t it be cool to see an epic \u201cAvengers\u201d-like moment with all of you owners of Valyrian steel \u2014 Jaime, Brienne, Jon, Sam, Arya \u2014 just taking out White Walkers?\nMmmm, that would be cool. [Laughs] But let\u2019s just wait and see if that happens. I\u2019m so excited.\nBack to some serious business, leaving Cersei is also leaving your unborn child\u2026\nThose things are 100 percent connected. That\u2019s also what he told her, he says, \u201cWhat\u2019s the point? If we don\u2019t defeat this threat, there is no future for our child.\u201d I think he\u2019s doing it for the right reasons, he gave his word, but also it\u2019s the future of mankind and the future of him and Cersei that\u2019s at stake.\u00a0\u00a0\nNow there is that prophecy that says she only has three children \u2013 so what are your thoughts on this? Is it Jaime\u2019s baby? Is it Euron Greyjoy\u2019s? Could she be tricking you?\n[Laughs] How depressing! But, no, I can\u2019t say anything. Euron Greyjoy\u2026\nYeah, no one likes that guy.\nNo.\nI\u2019m sure Season 8 is a game-changer for Jaime and the rest of these characters. Can you tell me anything about how you felt when you read the final season\u2019s scripts? Were you satisfied as a fan of this world?\nI wrote the writers when I finished reading and just said, \u201cI don\u2019t think you could\u2019ve done a better job at finishing this story.\u201d To me, it was very satisfying but also very surprising and all the things that I was hoping for. It still made sense. It wasn\u2019t like one of those where the killer is suddenly revealed in the last act and you go, \u201cOh! I didn\u2019t see that coming.\u201d Here, they\u2019ve done a really, really good job.\nAnd you made it to the final season!\nI know! It was a surprise. God, every time we got a new script I thought, \u201cOK, this is probably going to be the one.\u201d But no. The Lannister kids made it to the end.\nHow was it finally saying goodbye to this character being that it is the show\u2019s final season?\nIt was a little bit emotional at the very, very end. It\u2019s also just a build-up because throughout the season we had a lot of teary goodbyes and farewell dinners. When my turn came around, I really didn\u2019t think it was going to phase me, but I have to admit that right when they said, \u201cThis is a series wrap for Nikolaj,\u201d there might have been a tiny bit of moisture in the air, just around my eyes. [Laughs] But that was it, that was it.\nI\u2019m sure you went out and had a few beers or cocktails with your cast and crew to lift your spirits.\u00a0\nYeah. We did, we did. We had quite a few of those. And whether we\u2019ve been in scenes together or not, almost all of the season was shot in or around Belfast. So for the first time in all these years, the whole cast was, more or less, in town together the whole time. It was just a lot of fun to hang out and spend time together and appreciate what we\u2019ve experienced and how lucky we are to be a part of this show. Yes, the success of the show is great, but it\u2019s really also meeting all these people in Belfast \u2015 it\u2019s the same crew from Season 1 to the end. It\u2019s a special thing. And someone said we\u2019ve had no assholes, which is quite extraordinary, really. You look at a workplace of more than 1,000 people, and there are no assholes.", "date": "\n08/30/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/nikolaj-coster-waldau-jaime-lannister_n_5b7edaf2e4b0cd327dfabaad", "tags": "also cersei nikolaj think well really coster-waldau entertains season theories \u201d one ahead crucial thrones jaime"}
