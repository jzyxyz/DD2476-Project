{"title": "The I.N.F. Treaty, Explained", "content": "MOSCOW \u2014 The national security adviser, John R. Bolton, is in Moscow this week to explain to officials President Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of a 1987 arms-control pact.\nMr. Trump and his hard-line aides, particularly Mr. Bolton, have long expressed their displeasure with the agreement, the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty, because they say Russia is in violation of the terms and China is not a signatory.\n\u201cUnless Russia comes to us and China comes to us and they all come to us and they say, \u2018Let\u2019s all of us get smart and let\u2019s none of us develop those weapons,\u2019 \u201d America would pull out and start building new nuclear arms, Mr. Trump said after a campaign rally on Saturday.\nIn response, the Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, hinted at a new arms race, saying Russia would be forced also to develop new weapons \u201cto restore balance in this sphere.\u201d\nThe proposal and the Kremlin\u2019s reaction raised immediate questions about an aging arms control treaty that few people under the age of 30 even knew existed. Is it really so important that its demise would touch off a global arms race?\nThe treaty resolved a crisis of the 1980s when the Soviet Union deployed a missile in Europe called the SS-20, capable of carrying three nuclear warheads. The United States responded with cruise and Pershing II missiles.\nBy the time President Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader at the time, cut the deal to ban the weapons in 1987, the intermediate-range missiles had come to be seen as a hair trigger for nuclear war because of their short flight times \u2014 as little as 10 minutes.\nThis was particularly troubling to the Soviet command, which could be wiped out by a \u201cbolt from the blue\u201d strike before it could order a retaliatory attack. Partly in response to this shortcoming, Moscow developed a \u201cdead hand\u201d trigger to fire its arsenal at the United States without an order from the leadership, based on computers interpreting radiation and seismic sensors.\nIn 2014, during the Ukraine crisis, a government newspaper published an article saying this system using \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d to order nuclear war was still operative, though not switched on in peacetime.\nThe treaty prohibited land-based cruise or ballistic missiles with ranges between 311 miles and 3,420 miles. It did not cover air- or sea-launched weapons, such as the American Tomahawk and Russian Kalibr cruise missiles that are fired from ships, submarines or airplanes, and easily fly similar distances.\nIt certainly seems so. It was the Obama administration that first accused Russia of violating the treaty in 2014 as the crisis in Ukraine ratcheted up tensions. American officials say Moscow is all but openly deploying a prohibited missile that the West calls the SSC-8, a land-based cruise missile that menaces European nations.\nEven during the Obama administration, the United States argued that Russia was in violation of the treaty because it had deployed prohibited tactical nuclear weapons designed to intimidate Europe and the nations of the former Soviet states that have aligned with the West.\nBut the Trump administration\u2019s greatest worry may be in Asia, where the 1980s pact now constrains the United States from placing short- and intermediate-range missiles on land to respond to China\u2019s efforts to carve out a sphere of influence and keep naval forces at bay in the Western Pacific.\nThe Chinese, though not a signatory to the treaty, weighed in Monday, saying they also opposed the United States\u2019 unilateral withdrawal.\nMr. Bolton, speaking to the Echo of Moscow radio station in Moscow, responded that, \u201cthe Chinese are not participants in this agreement and want it preserved.\u201d\nThat was hardly a surprise, he said, adding, \u201cIf I were Chinese, I would say the same thing.\u201d\nIn brief, with warnings of an arms race and other apocalyptic threats.\nAsked about the possibility of a United States withdrawal earlier this month, President Vladimir V. Putin mused about nuclear Armageddon, saying Russians are ready to launch a retaliatory strike because they know they will go to heaven in a nuclear war.\n\u201cThe aggressors should know: Revenge is inevitable and they will be destroyed,\u201d Mr. Putin said. \u201cAnd we, as victims of aggression, will go straight to heaven as martyrs while they will just croak.\u201d\nOthers have been somewhat more restrained.\n\u201cAny action in this field will prompt a reaction,\u201d Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, told journalists before a meeting with Mr. Bolton.\nThis ranged from official warnings of a new arms race, with an outside expert threatening that Russia would develop a swarm of small drone-borne bombs to hit the United States, to suggestions that the move was a bluff on the eve of the midterm elections in the United States.\nOn Monday, Mr. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, denied that Russia had violated the treaty, saying that \u201con the contrary\u201d it was the Americans who had breached its spirit. Russia argues that American antimissile batteries in Europe could be used to fire offensive weapons, and that armed United States drones fly within the ranges prohibited by the treaty for cruise missiles.\nWith Mr. Bolton in town, Rossiskaya Gazeta, the government newspaper, ran an article under the headline \u201cTrump Turns to Blackmail,\u201d suggesting that he was applying the same hardball tactics he has on trade agreements to a nuclear deal.\nSince Russia\u2019s new intermediate range missiles threaten Europe, it was European leaders who most loudly protested withdrawal from the treaty.\nGermany\u2019s foreign minister, Heiko Maas, said in a statement that the treaty has \u201cbeen an important pillar of our European security architecture,\u201d while numerous analysts have noted that the issue has the potential to drive a new wedge between the United States and Europe at a time of deep stresses to trans-Atlantic relations.\nMaja Kocijancic, the European Union\u2019s spokeswoman for foreign affairs and security policy, said in a statement that, \u201cthe United States and the Russian Federation need to remain engaged in constructive dialogue to preserve the I.N.F. Treaty,\u201d because \u201cthe world doesn\u2019t need a new arms race.\u201d\nBut with Russia preparing to deploy a hypersonic missile that is not covered by existing arms control agreements, with China deploying intermediate range missiles and the United States responding by modifying cruise missiles to deploy in Asia, many experts maintain the world is already in engaged in one.", "date": "Oct. 23, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/23/world/europe/inf-treaty-russia-united-states-trump-nuclear.html", "tags": "nuclear united explained states missiles \u201d arms treaty russia i.n.f"}
