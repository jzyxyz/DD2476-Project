{"title": "U.N. General Assembly: Criticism and Praise for Trump Administration", "content": "Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and his Palestinian counterpart, President Mahmoud Abbas, both spoke in front of world leaders on Thursday, offering diametrically opposing views on the causes of the protracted Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nTheir speeches come a day after President Trump said he hoped to announce the framework for a peace deal in the coming months.\nEarlier this week, Mr. Trump largely overshadowed the other heads of state who gathered for the 73rd assembly, first drawing laughter from a roomful of foreign leaders and then surprising many when he accused China of interfering in the midterm elections.\nPresident Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority assailed the Trump administration on Thursday over pro-Israel decisions that he said \u201ccompletely contradict\u201d America\u2019s role as a mediator.\nMr. Abbas exhorted President Trump to rescind the decisions, which moved the American Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, defunded Palestinian aid, challenged the status of Palestinian refugees and countenanced Israeli settlement expansion.\n\u201cJerusalem is not for sale, and the Palestinian people\u2019s rights are not up for bargaining,\u201d Mr. Abbas said in his speech to a mostly friendly audience at the United Nations General Assembly.\nHe also assailed an Israeli law narrowly passed in July that enshrined Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, made Hebrew the only official language and asserted that the right of national self-determination was \u201cunique to the Jewish people.\u201d\nThe new law, Mr. Abbas said, \u201cwill inevitably lead to the creation of one racist state, an apartheid state, and nullifies the two-state solution.\u201d \u2014 RICK GLADSTONE\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who took the General Assembly podium a few speakers after Mr. Abbas had finished, quickly launched into a new accusation against Iran, which Israel regards as its top foe. Armed with what he described as visual evidence, Mr. Netanyahu said Iran had a \u201csecret atomic warehouse\u201d that Israeli intelligence had discovered, and he called on international nuclear inspectors to examine it.\nTurning to the Palestinians, Mr. Netanyahu angrily rejected Mr. Abbas\u2019s portrayal of Israel as an apartheid state like the former South Africa.\n\u201cPresident Abbas, you proudly pay Palestinian terrorists who murder Jews, in fact, the more they slay the more you pay, and you condemn Israel\u2019s morality, you call Israel racist?\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said. \u201cThis is not the way to peace.\u201d\nMr. Netanyahu also thanked President Trump and the American ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, for what he described as the \u201cunwavering support they have provided Israel at the United Nations.\u201d\n\u2014 MEGAN SPECIA AND RICK GLADSTONE\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday that the world was at \u201cthe dawn of a new day\u201d in confronting the threat posed by North Korea\u2019s weapons programs. But he warned that sanctions against the country must continue for now.\nAddressing the United Nations Security Council, Mr. Pompeo said that Mr. Trump\u2019s summit meeting in Singapore with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, in June had laid the groundwork for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\nBut he told the Council that until that process is complete, the world must abide by the economic sanctions on Pyongyang.\n\u201cWe must not forget what\u2019s brought us this far: the historic international pressure campaign that this Council has made possible through the sanctions that it imposed,\u201d he said.\nMr. Pompeo met on Wednesday with his North Korean counterpart, Ri Yong-ho, and will travel to Pyongyang next month in part to set the stage for a second summit meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim.\nWhile North Korea has halted its public tests of nuclear bombs and ballistic missiles, intelligence indicates that it has shown no slackening in its pace in building such weapons.\nStill, Russia and China called for the sanctions to be eased to reward North Korea for the progress made so far. Sergey V. Lavrov, Russia\u2019s foreign minister, criticized the United States for wanting to tighten sanctions, saying that tougher measures would harm North Koreans. \u2014 GARDINER HARRIS \nJacinda Ardern, New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, urged world leaders to embrace collective action in her statement to the General Assembly.\n\u201cIn the face of isolationism, protectionism, racism \u2014 the simple concept of looking outwardly and beyond ourselves, of kindness and collectivism, might just be as good a starting point as any,\u201d said Ms. Ardern, 38, who  this week became the first head of state to bring her baby \u2014 3-month-old Neve Gayford \u2014 to the United Nations.\nIn her speech, she repeatedly called on members to commit to rebuilding global institutions, not consign them to history.\nMs. Ardern said that instead of seeking to \u201cblame the nameless, faceless other,\u201d world leaders must instead \u201crebuild and recommit to multilateralism.\u201d\nVisiting the United Nations for the first time, Ms. Ardern devoted a large portion of her speech to climate change, the effects of which she called \u201cnot academic, or even arguable.\u201d Ms. Ardern later received a round of applause when she spoke about gender equality.\n\u201cMeToo must become WeToo,\u201d Ms. Ardern said. She noted while New Zealand had just marked its 125th anniversary of women\u2019s suffrage \u2014 it was the first country in the world to grant women the right to vote \u2014 it has also struggled with a gender pay gap, a disproportionate number of women in low-paid work and high levels of domestic violence. \u2014 CHARLOTTE GRAHAM-MCLAY\nAs speeches from world leaders proceeded at the General Assembly in New York on Thursday, the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva voted to establish a mechanism for gathering and preserving evidence of war crimes against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar.\nThe move is seen by some legal experts as an important step toward accountability and justice for the Rohingya.\nLast year, Myanmar\u2019s military began a broad campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya \u2014 a minority ethnic group in Myanmar\u2019s Rakhine State \u2014 burning villages, killing thousands and forcing hundreds of thousands to flee to Bangladesh.\nWhile international lawmakers welcomed Thursday\u2019s development, many see it as a starting point and urged action in the International Criminal Court.\n\u201cThe creation of this evidence gathering mechanism is a welcome concrete step towards justice,\u201d Matt Pollard, a senior legal adviser for the International Commission of Jurists, said in a statement after the vote.\n\u201cBut this is a stopgap measure, effectively creating a prosecutor without a court, that only underscores the urgent need for the Security Council to refer the entire situation to the International Criminal Court, which was created for precisely such circumstances.\u201d \u2014 MEGAN SPECIA\nDuring his opening remarks at the Security Council on Wednesday, Mr. Trump accused China of trying to meddle in this November\u2019s United States elections.\n\u201cRegrettably, we found that China is attempting to interfere in our upcoming 2018 election, coming up in November, against my administration,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThey do not want me, or us, to win, because I am the first president ever to challenge China on trade. And we are winning on trade, we are winning at every level.\u201d\nMr. Trump provided no evidence to back up his assertion, although he was apparently referring to retaliatory tariffs from China in the escalating trade war. At a news conference that evening, he said that \u201cwe have evidence\u201d of China\u2019s interference.\n\u201cI like China and I like President Xi a lot,\u201d Mr. Trump said, but later added, \u201cThey\u2019re trying to convince people to go against Trump.\u201d\nMuch of his speech on Wednesday at the Security Council was devoted to criticizing Iran, a theme that also dominated his address to the General Assembly a day earlier.\n\u201cThe regime is the world\u2019s leading sponsor of terror and fuels conflict across the region and beyond,\u201d Mr. Trump said, before calling the Iran nuclear deal a \u201chorrible, one-sided\u201d agreement.\nHe said he planned to introduce new economic sanctions on Iran this year, and that they would be \u201ctougher than ever before.\u201d\nYet Mr. Trump also had positive words for Iran, thanking its leadership and Russia for delaying a planned offensive on Idlib Province in Syria, where government forces are believed to be preparing what would probably be the final military blow against rebels and their civilian supporters.\nPresident Emmanuel Macron of France, who spoke to the Security Council directly after Mr. Trump, urged unity within the group. He said that relations with Iran must not be limited to a \u201cpolicy of sanctions\u201d and that long-term strategies must be put in place. \u2014 MEGAN SPECIA and TESS FELDER\nAs the world\u2019s oldest leader at age 93, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia has seen a lot of politicians come and go \u2014 including himself: He served as prime minister from 1982 to 2003, and returned to power in May.\nHe has also stood up to his regional powerhouse, diplomatically pushing back on financially onerous Chinese projects in Malaysia.\nWhile visiting New York for the General Assembly this week, he offered some cautionary advice for President Trump: Don\u2019t push too hard, he said in discussing Mr. Trump\u2019s comments about the Chinese government.\n\u201cI get the impression he doesn\u2019t know much about Asia,\u201d the Malaysian leader said at a meeting of the Council on Foreign Relations.\nAsked whether he thought a rapidly modernizing China was engaged in a new colonialism, Mr. Mahathir answered indirectly. \u201cWhen China is poor, it is dangerous,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen China is rich, it also is dangerous.\u201d\nWhile Mr. Trump has sought to cast China as a villain in his campaign to \u201cmake America great again,\u201d Mr. Mahathir suggested that more subtlety was required.\n\u201cWe have been dealing with China for 2,000 years,\u201d he said. \u201cI think you can make America great in many other ways.\u201d \u2014 RICK GLADSTONE\nPresident Hassan Rouhani of Iran, apparently emboldened by the less-than-enthusiastic reception for Mr. Trump, said the United States had isolated itself by renouncing the Iranian nuclear agreement and by warning others they a failure to heed restored American sanctions could bring reprisals.\nAt a news conference on Wednesday near the end of his annual visit to the General Assembly, Mr. Rouhani thanked the many other member states, including close American allies, that have expressed support for the nuclear accord. The United States withdrew from the agreement in May on Mr. Trump\u2019s orders.\nMr. Trump, the Iranian president said, ordered other countries not only to ignore the nuclear accord but also to essentially disregard Security Council Resolution 2231, which put it into effect. Security Council resolutions are supposed to be regarded as having the force of law.\n\u201cIt is quite strange, asking other members not to adhere to 2231,\u201d Mr. Rouhani told reporters. Asked whether Iran felt isolated and surrounded by hostile powers in the Middle East, Mr. Rouhani responded: \u201cWe\u2019re not isolated. America is isolated.\u201d\nWhile he acknowledged that United States sanctions had put pressure on his country, Mr. Rouhani said, \u201cIran has been in much tougher positions.\u201d\nAnd even as he thanked European countries for abiding by the nuclear agreement, he would not rule out the possibility that Iran itself might also abandon the accord if it does not get the promised economic benefits. \u2014 RICK GLADSTONE", "date": "Sept. 27, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/27/world/americas/united-nations-general-assembly-updates.html", "tags": "administration criticism iran china united \u201d trump assembly general praise \u2014 said u.n."}
