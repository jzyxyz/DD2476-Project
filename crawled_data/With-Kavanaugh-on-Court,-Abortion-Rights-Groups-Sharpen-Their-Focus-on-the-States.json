{"title": "With Kavanaugh on Court, Abortion Rights Groups Sharpen Their Focus on the States", "content": "LOUISVILLE, Ky. \u2014 Abortion rights groups, bracing for an assault on federal legal protections under a Supreme Court moved to the right by Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, are pouring millions into a state-level fight to preserve services \u2014 an echo of the localized strategy used successfully by their opponents for years.\nThe new initiatives, by groups like Planned Parenthood and Naral Pro-Choice America, have two primary goals: to challenge severely restrictive measures advanced by emboldened state legislatures, and to bolster clinics in places friendlier to abortion rights that may become a fallback if access elsewhere is restricted.\nThe groups have quickly sharpened their focus on the states after losing a bitter fight against the nomination of Justice Kavanaugh, whom they portrayed as a threat to Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that granted a constitutional right to abortion.\n\u201cWe were always scenario-planning for an eventuality, for what we call a post-Roe reality, while fighting Kavanaugh with everything we had,\u201d said Ilyse Hogue, president of Naral, which this month announced a $750,000 campaign aimed at turning out suburban female voters in competitive states in the midterm elections.\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at \u2018how do you quickly scale it up?\u2019 because we\u2019re racing against the clock,\u201d she said. \u201cNow we\u2019re in overdrive. We don\u2019t have time to build piecemeal anymore.\u201d\nPlanned Parenthood announced an initiative, Care for All, that aims to increase state-level lobbying for legislation protecting access to abortion, along with launching a series of media campaigns designed to counter the stigma of abortion.\nIt is also pouring additional resources into clinics in states with secure abortion rights, like California, Oregon and Rhode Island, as well as expanding remote medical services like telemedicine and a regional access network \u2014 all part of an effort to maintain its reach in areas where new prohibitions could be enacted.\nRachel Sussman, Planned Parenthood\u2019s director for state policy and advocacy, told reporters that the organization feels an obligation to plan for a day \u201cwhen Roe may be gone.\u201d\nThirteen cases currently in the federal appeals courts offer the Supreme Court a potential opportunity to reconsider Roe v. Wade. Twenty-two states are poised to ban abortion if Roe is overruled, according to an estimate by the Center for Reproductive Rights.\nWhile it is unclear if the Supreme Court will throw out 45 years of precedent and overturn Roe, the court is more starkly divided along ideological lines than it was in previous years when Roe\u2019s protections were challenged and ultimately upheld. If the court avoids the far-reaching step of actually overturning Roe, it could chip away at the ruling by upholding a series of state restrictions.\n\u201cInstead of having the constitutional fight be over if Roe is overturned, you\u2019re actually going to see constitutional fights continue and multiply in different states,\u201d said Mary Ziegler, a law professor at Florida State University and the author of \u201cBeyond Abortion: Roe v. Wade and the Battle for Privacy.\u201d Advocates are looking to codify protections in state constitutions by pushing ballot initiatives, urging legislatures to pass constitutional amendments, and asking state supreme courts to reinterpret constitutional provisions.\nFor decades, supporters of abortion rights could look to a bulwark at the federal level to preserve the core of Roe at key moments: Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, the Supreme Court\u2019s swing vote, whom Justice Kavanaugh replaced this month. While Justice Kennedy could be an unpredictable vote on abortion rights, in crucial cases he frequently joined the court\u2019s liberals in reaffirming the principles underpinning Roe.\n\u201cAs long as Kennedy was on the court, I think it\u2019s fair to say that the tendency was to rely on federal courts to protect those rights,\u201d said Maya Manian, a professor at the University of San Francisco School of Law.\n\u201cNow that the writing is on the wall,\u201d she said, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to turn to other avenues, which in our federal system would be the states.\u201d\nThat state-by-state approach has long been employed by opponents of abortion rights, particularly in the aftermath of the 2010 elections, when Tea Party insurgents swept into office, said David S. Cohen, a law professor at Drexel University. This year alone, state legislatures have passed a series of restrictive measures, including one in Kentucky that would curb an abortion procedure as early as 11 weeks into a pregnancy. Most of the measures have been challenged in court.\nAbortion opponents have also sought to enact new limits through ballot initiatives. Next month, voters in three states will vote on restrictive measures, including a proposed constitutional amendment in Alabama that would \u201crecognize and support the sanctity of unborn life and the rights of unborn children.\u201d\nThe intensified effort expected after Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s elevation to the Supreme Court is reopening questions that many Americans thought had been settled long ago.\n\u201cPeople in their 60s and 70s are saying, haven\u2019t we done this already?\u201d said Carol Sanger, a law professor at Columbia University and the author of \u201cAbout Abortion: Terminating Pregnancy in 21st Century America.\u201d \u201cThe answer is yes, but it\u2019s not as strong as it was because of the changes in the court.\u201d\nWhatever Roe v. Wade\u2019s ultimate fate, the country is unlikely to return to the era of back-alley abortions, in part because of technological innovations like telemedicine, which can increase access to medication abortions, as well as internet resources, said Ms. Manian, the San Francisco law professor.\nBut states could begin to direct their attacks at telemedicine, too, Ms. Manian warned. \u201cEven if we don\u2019t return to the coat hanger era, because of technological advancements,\u201d she said, \u201cit still doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s all O.K. to make abortion illegal.\u201d\nCare for All, the initiative announced by Planned Parenthood, includes building new facilities in places like El Paso and Richmond, Va., and expanding telemedicine services to aid out-of-state patients and those in remote areas. Both Planned Parenthood and Naral are releasing candidate endorsements, coupled with million-dollar ad campaigns to lobby against Republican candidates. One group of patient advocates even launched a pop-up travel agency to bring attention to patients who have to travel for care.\nMallory Quigley, a spokeswoman for the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group, said she was not concerned about the intensified advocacy efforts by abortion rights organizations. Enthusiasm, she said, appears to be equal on both sides.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot working behind the scenes,\u201d she said of efforts to sway lawmakers sympathetic to her cause.\nStanding alone last week outside the EMW Women\u2019s Surgical Center in Louisville, Kentucky\u2019s only abortion clinic, in his attempt to dissuade young women from going inside, Joe Lynch said he felt that Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation had only deepened the division in the abortion debate.\nLast month, a federal judge struck down a state law that would have forced the clinic to close \u2014 a ruling that was swiftly appealed. Laws and judges, Mr. Lynch said, are not guaranteed to give him the result he seeks: the end of the practice altogether.\n\u201cDrugs are illegal, but people still do them, regardless of what the law says,\u201d he said, pacing back and forth in the cold.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be out here,\u201d he added, \u201cfor as long as it takes.\u201d", "date": "Oct. 19, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/19/us/politics/kavanaugh-abortion-states-rights.html", "tags": "groups kavanaugh court rights sharpen states \u201d justice roe focus abortion state"}
