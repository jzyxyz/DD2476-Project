{"title": "Michael Flynn Was a Key Cooperator and Should Serve Little Prison Time, Mueller Says", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Michael T. Flynn, President Trump\u2019s first national security adviser, helped substantially with the special counsel\u2019s investigation and should receive little to no prison time for lying to federal investigators, prosecutors said on Tuesday.\nMr. Flynn was a key cooperator who helped the Justice Department with several investigations, prosecutors for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, said. He sat for 19 interviews with Mr. Mueller\u2019s office and other prosecutors and handed over documents and communications, they said.\n\u201cHis early cooperation was particularly valuable because he was one of the few people with long-term and firsthand insight\u201d into the subject of Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation \u2014 Russia\u2019s election interference and whether any Trump associates conspired, prosecutors wrote in a sentencing recommendation memorandum and an addendum that was heavily blacked out.\nIn particular, they wrote, he might have prompted others to cooperate with the inquiry. \u201cThe defendant\u2019s decision to plead guilty and cooperate likely affected the decisions of related firsthand witnesses to be forthcoming,\u201d prosecutors said.\nThey also indicated that Mr. Flynn helped with other investigations without revealing details about them.\nMr. Flynn, who served briefly as the president\u2019s national security adviser, is the only White House aide and the first person from the president\u2019s inner circle to strike a cooperation deal with the special counsel\u2019s office in exchange for a more lenient penalty. He pleaded guilty a year ago to lying to the F.B.I. about conversations he had with the Russian ambassador to the United States at the time, Sergey I. Kislyak.\n\u201cThe defendant deserves credit for accepting responsibility in a timely fashion and substantially assisting the government,\u201d prosecutors wrote.\nThe cases of some other former Trump aides caught up in the special counsel investigation are also nearing resolution, marking an active week for Mr. Mueller\u2019s inquiry. By Friday, Mr. Mueller\u2019s prosecutors are due to enumerate how they believe Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, violated a plea agreement and separately to outline the extent of cooperation by Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump\u2019s longtime lawyer and fixer.\nAnother longtime Trump associate whom Mr. Mueller is scrutinizing, Roger J. Stone Jr., said on Tuesday that he had invoked his the Fifth Amendment rights in response to a request from Democratic investigators for the Senate Judiciary Committee to hand over documents and testimony relevant to their own Russia inquiry. Mr. Stone\u2019s lawyer, Grant J. Smith, said the committee\u2019s request was \u201coverbroad\u201d and stressed that Mr. Stone was \u201can innocent citizen who denounces secrecy.\u201d\nThe letter was dated Monday, the same day that Mr. Trump praised Mr. Stone on Twitter for having the \u201cguts\u201d to stand up to Mr. Mueller. Mr. Stone\u2019s lawyer said that the letter was sent before Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet.\nA grand jury in Washington has been investigating whether Mr. Stone had any advance knowledge of how WikiLeaks planned to use documents stolen from Democratic computers by Russian agents during the 2016 presidential campaign.\nProsecutors said Mr. Flynn\u2019s more than 33 years of military service \u2014 he was a three-star Army general before being fired as the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014 \u2014 should be taken into account when Judge Emmet G. Sullivan of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia sentences him on Dec. 18. But they also noted he should have known better than to lie to the F.B.I. \u201cSenior government leaders should be held to the highest standards,\u201d they wrote.\nClose observers of Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation had hoped his team might provide revealing details about possible cooperation between Trump associates and Russia, but in typical fashion, the special counsel\u2019s office kept its cards closely held.\nThough the lack of details suggested that Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation remains active, one of the president\u2019s personal lawyers, Rudolph W. Giuliani, seized on it to underscore that Mr. Mueller had yet to prove any Trump associates conspired with Russia\u2019s campaign of disruption. \u201cThis is what we get for $30 million and two years of an investigation and no evidence of collusion, and we get a process charge?\u201d he said, referring to Mr. Flynn\u2019s plea of lying to the F.B.I. and rounding up the estimated costs of the special counsel inquiry.\nMr. Flynn, who gained notoriety after he left the military for his view of Islamic terrorism as an existential threat to the United States, began advising the Trump campaign in early 2016. About a week after his surprise election victory, Mr. Trump named Mr. Flynn as his future national security adviser.\nDuring the presidential transition, Mr. Flynn discussed with Mr. Kislyak a coming United Nations Security Council vote on whether to condemn Israel\u2019s building of settlements. At the time, the Obama administration was preparing to allow a Security Council vote on the matter.\nThe two men also spoke about sanctions imposed by the Obama administration on Russia over its election interference in December 2016. Mr. Flynn asked that Moscow refrain from escalating the situation, and Mr. Kislyak said Russia \u201chad chosen to moderate its response.\u201d\nJust days after Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration in January 2017, Mr. Flynn was interviewed by the F.B.I. as part of the investigation into Russia\u2019s influence campaign in the 2016 election. During the interview, Mr. Flynn lied to agents, a crime that carries up to five years in prison. At the time, the acting attorney general, Sally Q. Yates, warned the White House that Mr. Flynn might be compromised by the Russians.\nWhy Mr. Flynn chose to lie about his and Mr. Kislyak\u2019s discussions remains a mystery to the F.B.I. officials who investigated the case. Before investigators interviewed Mr. Flynn at the White House, he had indicated to a senior F.B.I. official that he knew the United States had been listening to Mr. Kislyak\u2019s calls, former law enforcement officials said.\nMr. Mueller\u2019s prosecutors gave no indication about why he lied. Mr. Flynn\u2019s own memo to seek a light sentence in the case is due by Dec. 11.\nMr. Flynn served only 24 days as national security adviser. He was forced to resign as the White House cited his failure to be forthcoming with Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with Mr. Kislyak.\nMr. Flynn has largely remained out of news headlines since taking the plea deal a year ago. And Mr. Trump has said little about him since, even as he lashed out at other former aides who agreed to cooperate with investigators in exchange for lighter punishments.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen it many times,\u201d the president told \u201cFox & Friends\u201d in August after Mr. Manafort was convicted of financial fraud and Mr. Cohen agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. \u201cI\u2019ve had many friends involved in this stuff; it\u2019s called flipping, and it almost ought to be illegal. It\u2019s not a fair thing.\u201d\nAfter being fired  by President Barack Obama in 2014 after repeated clashes with other administration officials about his job performance, Mr. Flynn went on to form his own consulting company.\nAmong his clients was Turkey, which paid him more than a half-million dollars to target Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish cleric who lives in Pennsylvania. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey believes that Mr. Gulen and his supporters were behind a failed coup attempt in 2016 and has repeatedly demanded the United States extradite Mr. Gulen, who fled Turkey 1999.\nOn Election Day in 2016, Mr. Flynn published an op-ed article in The Hill, a newspaper serving Congress, calling Mr. Gulen \u201ca shady Islamic mullah\u201d and a \u201cradical Islamist.\u201d\nProsecutors did not charge Mr. Flynn with crimes related to his work on behalf of the Turkish government. But in documents, they have made clear that they have evidence that Mr. Flynn \u201cmade materially false statements and omissions\u201d in his federal filings about that lobbying work.\nThey admonished Mr. Flynn in Tuesday\u2019s memo for concealing his work for Turkey, saying it kept the public in the dark about the extent of its efforts to influence public opinion about the failed coup.", "date": "Dec. 4, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/04/us/politics/michael-flynn-special-counsel-sentencing-memo.html", "tags": "prosecutors cooperator key little investigation mueller \u201d said prison flynn says michael time serve"}
