{"title": "Donald Trump Calls on Russia to Find Hillary Clinton\u2019s Missing Emails", "content": "DORAL, Fla. \u2014 Donald J. Trump said on Wednesday that he hoped Russian intelligence services had successfully hacked Hillary Clinton\u2019s email, and encouraged them to publish whatever they may have stolen, essentially urging a foreign adversary to conduct cyberespionage against a former secretary of state.\n\u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,\u201d Mr. Trump said during a news conference here in an apparent reference to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s deleted emails. \u201cI think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.\u201d\nMr. Trump\u2019s call was another bizarre moment in the mystery of whether Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s government has been seeking to influence the United States\u2019 presidential race.\nHis comments came amid questions about the hacking of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s computer servers, which American intelligence agencies have told the White House they have \u201chigh confidence\u201d was the work of the Russian government.\nAt the same news conference, Mr. Trump also appeared to leave the door open to accepting Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea two years ago \u2014 which the United States and its European allies consider an illegal seizure of territory. That seizure, and the continued efforts of Russian-aided insurgents to undermine the government of Ukraine, are the reason that the United States and its allies still have economic sanctions in force against Moscow.\nWhen asked whether he would recognize Crimea \u201cas Russian territory\u201d and lift the sanctions, Mr. Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019ll be looking at that. Yeah, we\u2019ll be looking.\u201d\nMr. Trump\u2019s apparent willingness to avoid condemning Mr. Putin\u2019s government is a remarkable departure from United States policy and Republican Party orthodoxy, and has fueled the questions about Russian meddling in the campaign. Mr. Trump has denied that, saying at the news conference that he has never met Mr. Putin, and has no investments in Russia.\n\u201cI would treat Vladimir Putin firmly, but there\u2019s nothing I can think of that I\u2019d rather do than have Russia friendly as opposed to the way they are right now,\u201d he said, \u201cso that we can go and knock out ISIS together.\u201d\nMr. Trump later tried to modify his remarks about hacking Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails, contending they represented an effort to get the Russians to turn over their trove to the F.B.I.\nWith the political conventions coming to an end on Thursday, Mr. Trump is expected to receive his first national security briefings from American intelligence agencies in coming days. It is unclear whether those briefings \u2014 which describe the global challenges facing the United States but not continuing covert operations or especially sensitive intelligence \u2014 will change any of his views.\nHis comments about Russian hacking came on a day when Obama administration officials were already beginning to develop options for possible retaliation against Russia for the attack on the Democratic National Committee. As is often the case after cyber incidents, the options for responding are limited and can be viewed as seeming too mild or too escalatory.\nThe administration has not publicly accused the Russian government of the Democratic National Committee hacking, or presented evidence to back up such a case. The leaked documents, first published by a hacker who called himself \u201cGuccifer 2.0\u201d and who is now believed to be a character created by Russian intelligence, portrayed some committee officials as favoring Mrs. Clinton\u2019s candidacy while denigrating her opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders. The release of the internal party emails and documents led to the resignation of Debbie Wasserman Schultz as chairwoman of the party.\nMr. Trump contended on Wednesday that the political uproar over whether Russia was meddling in the election was a \u201ctotal deflection\u201d from the embarrassing content of the emails. Many Republicans, even some who say they do not support Mr. Trump, say they agree.\nIf Mr. Trump is serious in his call for Russian hacking or exposing Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails, he would be urging a power often hostile to the United States to violate American law by breaking into a private computer network. He would also be contradicting the Republican platform, adopted last week in Cleveland, saying that cyberespionage \u201cwill not be tolerated,\u201d and promising to \u201crespond in kind and in greater magnitude\u201d to all Chinese and Russian cyberattacks.\nIn the past, the Obama administration has stopped short of retaliating against Russia \u2014 at least in any public fashion \u2014 for its attacks on the State Department and White House unclassified email systems, or on networks used by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It never even publicly identified Russian intelligence as the source of those intrusions, though the subject was widely discussed by senior United States officials when they were not speaking for attribution.\nIn contrast, the United States did bring indictments against Chinese and Iranian hackers for thefts of intellectual property and attacks on American banks, and imposed economic sanctions against North Korea in early 2015, for hacking into Sony Pictures Entertainment\u2019s computers.\nAlmost as soon as Mr. Trump spoke, other Republicans raced in to try to reframe his remarks and argue that Russia should be punished. A spokesman for Speaker Paul D. Ryan termed Russia \u201ca global menace led by a devious thug.\u201d The spokesman, Brendan Buck, added: \u201cPutin should stay out of this election.\u201d\nEven Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, Mr. Trump\u2019s running mate, issued a statement, saying that \u201cif it is Russia and they are interfering in our elections, I can assure you both parties and the United States government will ensure there are serious consequences.\u201d Mr. Pence did not attend Wednesday\u2019s news conference because he was giving local television interviews, and an aide to Mr. Pence said that his team had written his statement about Russia before Mr. Trump began speaking.\nShortly after that Mr. Trump sent a message on Twitter  declaring \u201cIf Russia or any other country or person has Hillary Clinton\u2019s 33,000 illegally deleted emails, perhaps they should share them with the FBI!\u201d\nThe fact that the Democratic committee\u2019s servers were targeted \u2014 and, apparently, not those of the Republican National Committee \u2014 has brought up inevitable comparisons with the origins of the Watergate scandal, when burglars found little after breaking into Democratic committee offices before the 1972 election. The hackers, more than 40 years later, were more successful: A reconstruction of events suggests the first successful piercing of the Democrats\u2019 networks occurred in June 2015, long before the Russians, or anyone else, could have known Mr. Trump would get the nomination.\nThe Clinton campaign, eager to turn the subject from the chaos caused by the email release to the question of Russian interference, accused Mr. Trump of encouraging Russian espionage.\n\u201cThis has to be the first time that a major presidential candidate has actively encouraged a foreign power to conduct espionage against his political opponent,\u201d said Jake Sullivan, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s chief foreign policy adviser, whose emails from when he was a State Department aide were among those that were hacked.\n\u201cThis has gone from being a matter of curiosity, and a matter of politics, to being a national security issue,\u201d he added.\nFor his part, Mr. Trump cast doubt on the conclusion that Russia was behind the hacking. \u201cI have no idea,\u201d he said. He said the \u201csad thing\u201d is that \u201cwith the genius we have in government, we don\u2019t even know who took the Democratic National Committee emails.\u201d\nMr. Trump then argued that if Russia, or any other foreign government, was behind the hacking, it showed just how little respect other nations had for the current administration.\n\u201cPresident Trump would be so much better for U.S.-Russian relations\u201d than a President Clinton, Mr. Trump said. \u201cI don\u2019t think Putin has any respect whatsoever for Clinton.\u201d\nFormer Representative Pete Hoekstra of Michigan, a Republican who had served as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said Mr. Trump was right to keep hammering Mrs. Clinton on the subject of her private emails.\nMr. Hoekstra said he was untroubled by Mr. Trump\u2019s goading of a foreign power, particularly in light of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s use of a private server while she was secretary of state.\n\u201dTrump is bringing up a fairly valid point: Hillary Clinton, with her personal email at the State Department, has put the Russians in a very enviable position,\u201d Mr. Hoekstra said. \u201cMost likely the Russians already have all that info on Hillary.\u201d\nBut Representative Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican who led the House oversight committee that looked into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails, was more critical. If Mr. Trump\u2019s comments were meant literally, he said in an interview, \u201cI think he was absolutely wrong and out of line. I would never have said it that way, and I think it was ill-advised.\u201d\nIf the remark was tongue-in-cheek, he added, it failed at political humor.", "date": "July 27, 2016", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/28/us/politics/donald-trump-russia-clinton-emails.html", "tags": "calls find \u201c hillary clinton missing russian committee trump emails donald russia"}
