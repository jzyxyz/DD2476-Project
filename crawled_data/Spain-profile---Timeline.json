Bourbon dynasty, originally from France, centralises the Spanish state, shutting down many regional autonomous assemblies and modernising government and the military.\n1807-1814 - Napoleon's France occupies Spain, which has been a French satellite since 1795. Fierce nationalist resistance and British intervention in the Peninsular War gradually force French troops out.\n19th century - Napoleonic legacy of political division and economic dislocation leaves Spain weak and unstable, with frequent changes of government and a low-level insurgency by Carlist supporters of a rival branch of the royal family. \nAll Latin American colonies win their independence, with Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines in Asia lost during a disastrous war with the United States in 1898.\n1910s - Spain sought compensation in conquering colonies in Africa, most significantly northern Morocco and the Spanish Sahara. \n1920s - The trade boom achieved by neutrality in the First World War is squandered through fighting Moroccan rebels and the financial mismanagement of the Primo de Rivera dictatorship at home. \n1931 - The return of democratic government leads to an electoral backlash against the monarchy and its allies, and a republic is declared.

More than 350,000 Spaniards died in the fighting, and Franco purges all remaining Republicans. \nSpain remains neutral throughout the Second World War, although the government's sympathies clearly lie with the Axis powers.\n1946-50 - Francoist Spain is ostracised by United Nations and many countries sever diplomatic relations.\n1950s - As the Cold War deepens the US gradually improves relations with Spain, extending loans in return for military bases. \nSpain is admitted to the UN in 1955 and the World Bank in 1958, and other European countries open up to the Franco government. \nEl Milagro Espanol - the economic miracle of the late 1950s - sees Spain's manufacturing and tourism industries take off through liberalisation of state controls. \n1959 - The Eta armed separatist group is founded with the aim of fighting for an independent homeland in the Basque region of Spain and France.
