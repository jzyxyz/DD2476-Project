{"title": "North Korea Tests New Weapon", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 North Korea said on Thursday that it test-fired a new type of \u201ctactical guided weapon,\u201d in what appeared to be a warning from Kim Jong-un to President Trump that unless once-promising negotiations with Washington resume, the two countries could again be on a collision course.\nThe North\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency did not specify what type of weapon was involved in the test. But there was no evidence the test involved a nuclear detonation or an intercontinental ballistic missile.\n[Sign up for the weekly At War newsletter to receive stories about duty, conflict and consequence.]\nThe North has observed a voluntary moratorium of those tests since November 2017, and President Trump has repeatedly said that the North\u2019s self-imposed suspension of nuclear and long-range missile tests was one of his administration\u2019s biggest achievements, crediting himself with averting war by first threatening the North with \u201cfire and fury\u201d and then holding two face-to-face meetings with Mr. Kim.\nBut at the latest of those meetings, in Hanoi in February, the two leaders failed to reach an agreement, after Mr. Trump rejected, at the insistence of his top advisers, Mr. Kim\u2019s proposal to lift the harshest sanctions on the North in return for suspending operations at North Korea\u2019s largest nuclear facility. Since then, there has been virtually no communication, much less negotiation, between the two countries.\nNow Mr. Kim appears to be carefully calibrating his expressions of displeasure.\nExperts said it was likely that the test announced on Thursday morning in Pyongyang was a demonstration of a conventional weapons system, perhaps artillery or antiaircraft. If so, that would amount to signal-sending by Mr. Kim, who North Korea media said witnessed the test.\nHis presence sent an unmistakable message: That the North would continue to amass new arms while the standoff with Washington continued. Mr. Kim hailed the event as having \u201cvery weighty significance.\u201d\nIn recent days the North Korean leader has said he would give the United States until the end of the year to come up with concrete proposals that would lift sanctions on the North \u2014 an implicit warning that, after that deadline, it might resume the nuclear and intercontinental missile testing that had appeared, in the summer of 2017, to be leading to conflict.\nShortly after announcing the weapons test, the North Koreans threw in a new condition to any continued talks: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, considered a hard-liner who helped persuade Mr. Trump to reject North Korea\u2019s proposed terms for an agreement, could not be part of future negotiations.\nIn a statement, a foreign ministry official, Kwon Jong-gun, accused Mr. Pompeo of \u201cletting loose reckless remarks and sophism of all kinds against us every day.\u201d\nThe test announced on Thursday suggested that Mr. Kim was willing to consider gradually raising the stakes sooner, and making Mr. Trump fear that his signature foreign policy initiative could collapse before the 2020 elections.\nMr. Kim has also been under pressure at home, where many expected him to return from Hanoi celebrating a lifting of the sanctions that have weighed heavily on the North Korean economy.\nThe breakdown of the Hanoi summit was considered a huge embarrassment for Mr. Kim. He took a 65-hour-long train ride to meet Mr. Trump in Hanoi and had to return home without badly needed relief from sanctions. Following the breakdown, satellite imagery showed new activities at some of the North\u2019s long-range rocket test and missile development sites.\nShin Beom-chul, a North Korea expert at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul, said that with this test, Mr. Kim was exhorting his people to prepare for a military standoff with the United States while at the same time putting pressure on Washington.\n\u201cThis time he tried a conventional-weapon test, but he is clearly signaling that if the Americans don\u2019t offer a compromise by the end of the year, he will switch to more provocative strategic-weapons tests beginning next year,\u201d Mr. Shin said.\nBut the test also revealed Mr. Kim\u2019s growing desperation, said Woo Jung-yeop, a North Korea expert at the Sejong Institute in South Korea.\n\u201cKim Jong-un could not dare a big provocation, but he had to try something to show that North Korea remains a threat and to draw a reluctant United States back to the negotiating table,\u201d said Mr. Woo.\nThe White House had no immediate comment on the test.\nSeveral days ago, appearing with President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, Mr. Trump for the first time suggested he might be willing to entertain a \u201cstep-by-step\u201d deal to denuclearization \u2014 contradicting his own senior aides, who had been insisting in public comments and private briefings with reporters that only a full dismantlement of the North\u2019s nuclear weapons, missiles and facilities would result in the lifting of sanctions.\nAt the meeting in Hanoi, the second between the two leaders who first met in Singapore in June 2018, Mr. Trump had proposed exactly that grand bargain: North Korea would get rid of its entire nuclear weapons arsenal, as well as the material and facilities needed to build and test the weapons, in exchange for an end to the American-led sanctions.\nMr. Kim put forth a much more modest bargain in Hanoi. The North would dismantle the Yongbyon nuclear complex, an aging facility at the heart of its nuclear program, for an end to the sanctions most damaging to its economy, those enacted since 2016.\nTalks quickly broke down, and the summit collapsed, with both sides pointing fingers.\nIn a speech earlier this year, Mr. Kim warned that his country might take a \u201cnew way\u201d of protecting its interest if the United States insisted on maintaining sanctions.\nDuring Thursday\u2019s test of the weapon, which was conducted by the North\u2019s Academy of Defense Science, Mr. Kim said its development \u201cserves as an event of very weighty significance in increasing the combat power of the People\u2019s Army,\u201d the North Korean news agency said.\nThe test was the first since last November when the country said Mr. Kim had attended the test of an unidentified \u201cnewly developed ultramodern tactical weapon.\u201d\nAfter that test, the South Korean news media, quoting government sources, said that North Korea appeared to have tested multiple-rocket launchers, not missiles. Besides the North\u2019s nuclear weapons and missiles, which are probably capable of reaching the continental United States, such rockets are considered one of the greatest military threats to South Korea, because the North deploys them near the countries\u2019 border to target the South\u2019s capital, Seoul, a city of 10 million people.\nThe Defense Ministry of South Korea did not immediately comment on the North\u2019s latest weapon test. But officials there said the test of a \u201ctactical weapon\u201d indicated that Mr. Kim was being careful not to step over the line by conducting nuclear and long-range ballistic missile tests.\nWhile Mr. Kim is clearly impatient with Washington, he has avoided direct criticism of Mr. Trump. Instead, he has portrayed other members of the administration as hawks, or warmongers, making clear the only way to resolve the issues is in personality-driven diplomacy with Mr. Trump.\nBut some analysts in South Korea had warned that the North might resort to low-level provocations, like rocket or even short-range ballistic missile tests, to increase its bargaining power should Mr. Trump not return to the negotiating table with a compromise.\nNorth Korea has a history of using the prospect of rising tensions on the Korean Peninsula as leverage when negotiations with Washington do not go in its favor.\nMr. Trump, who has said he and Mr. Kim \u201cfell in love,\u201d has said he would be \u201cvery disappointed\u201d if the North resumes weapons tests. But he also said he was in no hurry to meet Mr. Kim again. United States officials hope that sanctions will eventually force North Korea back to the negotiating table with a more palatable offer to denuclearize.", "date": "April 17, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/17/world/asia/north-korea-missile-weapons-test.html", "tags": "nuclear kim \u201d tests new north test weapon korea"}
