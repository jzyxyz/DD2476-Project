{"title": "Jerome Corsi, Friend of Roger Stone, Is in Plea Talks With Mueller", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Jerome Corsi, a conspiracy theorist and ally of the former Trump campaign adviser Roger J. Stone Jr., is in plea negotiations with prosecutors working on the special counsel investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election.\nA person familiar with the talks said that the prosecutors had presented Mr. Corsi with evidence that he had not been truthful when investigators asked him whether he knew beforehand that WikiLeaks was going to publish emails stolen from Democratic computers during the campaign.\nThe special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, and his team are trying to discover whether anyone connected with the Trump campaign knew of or cooperated with the Russian intelligence operatives who hacked the Democratic systems and funneled the emails to WikiLeaks in an attempt to undercut Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.\nAlthough Mr. Corsi apparently had no direct connection to the Trump campaign, he was in touch with Mr. Stone, a former campaign adviser who communicated with senior campaign officials through the election. Mr. Stone claimed during the campaign that he had a back channel to WikiLeaks, but now says he was merely bluffing to unsettle Mrs. Clinton\u2019s team. Mr. Stone also communicated with Guccifer 2.0, the online persona used by one or more Russian intelligence operatives who hacked the Democratic systems.\nAlthough Mr. Corsi, 72, insisted in an interview two weeks ago with The New York Times that he had told investigators the truth, the special counsel\u2019s office has decided that his text messages and emails contradict some of his statements about whether he knew details about the purloined materials before they were released, according to people familiar with those discussions.\nDavid Gray, Mr. Corsi\u2019s lawyer, declined to comment on the plea talks, which were first reported  by The Washington Post.\nFederal investigators have questioned a host of Mr. Stone\u2019s associates about his relationship with WikiLeaks. Three senior Trump campaign officials have told them that Mr. Stone created the impression that he was a conduit of information from WikiLeaks, according to people familiar with the inquiry. One of them said Mr. Stone not only seemed to predict WikiLeaks\u2019 actions, but also took credit afterward for disclosures that damaged Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign.\nMr. Corsi is among a string of witnesses who have recently testified before a federal grand jury about the matter. In the interview with The Times, he said that prosecutors quizzed him for about 40 hours, then warned his lawyer that the next phase of their talks would involve a possible plea agreement.\n\u201cI took that to mean they were planning to indict me\u201d on charges of lying to federal authorities, Mr. Corsi said. \u201cI still believe I\u2019ve told them the truth, and to the best of my ability and the best of my recollection,\u201d he added, but \u201cmy memory of 2016 is not perfect, by any means.\u201d\nAsked about the plea talks on Friday, Mr. Stone said, \u201cMy friend Dr. Corsi has been under a tremendous amount of pressure, and it is beginning to affect him profoundly.\u201d Mr. Stone insisted, as he has repeatedly, that he had only secondhand information, at best, about WikiLeaks\u2019 plans to disrupt the presidential race.\nAmong other issues, investigators have been asking about an Aug. 21, 2016, Twitter message in which Mr. Stone predicted that John D. Podesta, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, would soon face his \u201ctime in the barrel.\u201d Mr. Stone posted his message six weeks before WikiLeaks began releasing tens of thousands of Mr. Podesta\u2019s emails, throwing the Clinton campaign on the defensive a month before the November election.\nMr. Corsi has publicly backed Mr. Stone\u2019s explanation of the message, saying Mr. Stone was predicting that Mr. Podesta would face controversy about his overseas business dealings, not stolen emails. \u201cHaving reviewed my records, I am now confident that I am the source behind Stone\u2019s tweet,\u201d he wrote in an early 2017 article on Infowars, a site that promotes conspiracy theories.\nIn a broadcast on YouTube this month, Mr. Corsi insisted that he had possessed no inside information or ties to Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks. He compared the special counsel\u2019s team to the Gestapo, saying that \u201cthey asked the same questions over and over again,\u201d until \u201cmy mind was mush.\u201d\nLike Mr. Stone, he said that he had relied mostly on public information to \u201cconnect the dots\u201d about the role of WikiLeaks in the November election. \u201cTo the best of my recollection, I didn\u2019t have anyone who connected me to Julian Assange,\u201d he said in the YouTube video. \u201cAnd what I knew in advance about what Julian Assange was going to do, I figured out.\u201d\n\u201cI guess I couldn\u2019t tell the special prosecutor what they wanted to hear,\u201d he said then.\nMr. Mueller\u2019s team has charged several people who have misled federal investigators. Three former Trump campaign officials or advisers have pleaded guilty to that offense: Michael T. Flynn, Rick Gates and George Papadopoulos. So did a Dutch lawyer, Alex van der Zwaan, who had business dealings with Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman.", "date": "Nov. 23, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/23/us/politics/jerome-corsi-plea.html", "tags": "wikileaks special stone roger plea \u201d jerome trump friend corsi campaign mueller talks"}
