{"title": "New York Post Attacks Ilhan Omar For 'Dismissive' 9-11 Comments", "content": "The New York Post, owned by conservative media mogul Rupert Murdoch, piled on to the Islamaphobic bashing of Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) Thursday, invoking\u00a0an out-of-context quote of the lawmaker describing the Sept. 11 attacks as \u201csome people did something.\u201d\nThursday\u2019s cover of the tabloid newspaper reads: \u201cHere\u2019s your something,\u201d citing the \u201c2,977 people dead by terrorism,\u201d and characterizing Omar\u2019s comments as \u201creferring dismissively to the terrorist attacks.\u201d\nOmar, a freshman lawmaker who is one of the first Muslim women elected to Congress, made the now-controversial remark last month discussing how Muslims in the U.S. were blamed for the 9/11 attacks and subjected to Islamophobic hatred.\n\u201cCAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something, and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties,\u201d she said during a speech to the Council on American-Islamic Relations.\nThe advocacy nonprofit, formed in 1994, stepped up its work in response to Islamophobia that followed the terror attacks.\u00a0\n\u201cFar too long we have lived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen,\u201d Omar said during the speech. \u201cFrankly, I\u2019m tired of it, and every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it.\u201d\nConservatives, particularly on Murdoch\u2019s Fox News, regularly lob\u00a0anti-Muslim attacks at Omar, trying to portray her as \u201cother,\u201d an experience shared by many Muslims in the U.S.\n\u201cYou have to wonder if she\u2019s an American first,\u201d \u201cFox & Friends\u201d co-host Brian Kilmeade said Wednesday.\nLater Wednesday, Omar spoke out against the \u201cdouble standard\u201d she said she has faced as a Muslim woman, and criticized \u201cFox & Friends\u201d directly.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not insinuation. They actually said that I might not be an American. My loyalties might not be to this country,\u201d she said on \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\u201d \u201cI took an oath to uphold the Constitution. I am as American as everyone else is.\u201d", "date": "\n04/11/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ilhan-omar-9-11-comments_n_5caf4801e4b0308735d5f1df", "tags": "american fox york omar \u201d muslim murdoch comments ilhan post new attacks"}
