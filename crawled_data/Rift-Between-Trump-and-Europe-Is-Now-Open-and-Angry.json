{"title": "Rift Between Trump and Europe Is Now Open and Angry", "content": "MUNICH \u2014 European leaders have long been alarmed that President Trump\u2019s words and Twitter messages could undo a trans-Atlantic alliance that had grown stronger over seven decades. They had clung to the hope that those ties would bear up under the strain.\nBut in the last few days of a prestigious annual security conference in Munich, the rift between Europe and the Trump administration became open, angry and concrete, diplomats and analysts say.\nA senior German official, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak on such matters, shrugged his shoulders and said: \u201cNo one any longer believes that Trump cares about the views or interests of the allies. It\u2019s broken.\u201d\nThe most immediate danger, diplomats and intelligence officials warned, is that the trans-Atlantic fissures now risk being exploited by Russia and China.\nEven the normally gloomy Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, happily noted the strains, remarking that the Euro-Atlantic relationship had become increasingly \u201ctense.\u201d\n\u201cWe see new cracks forming, and old cracks deepening,\u201d Mr. Lavrov said.\nThe Europeans no longer believe that Washington will change, not when Mr. Trump sees traditional allies as economic rivals and leadership as diktat. His distaste for multilateralism and international cooperation is a challenge to the very heart of what Europe is and needs to be in order to have an impact in the world.\nBut beyond the Trump administration, an increasing number of Europeans say they believe that relations with the United States will never be the same again.\nKarl Kaiser, a longtime analyst of German-American relations, said, \u201cTwo years of Mr. Trump, and a majority of French and Germans now trust Russia and China more than the United States.\u201d\nThomas Kleine-Brockhoff, a former adviser to the German president and director of the Berlin office of the German Marshall Fund, said, \u201cIf an alliance becomes unilateral and transactional, then it\u2019s no longer an alliance.\u201d\nThere were signs that not all American and European leaders were willing to surrender the alliance so easily.\nTo show solidarity with Europe, more than 50 American lawmakers, both Republicans and Democrats \u2014 a record number \u2014 attended the Munich Security Conference. They came, said Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, \u201cto show Europeans that there is another branch of government which strongly supports NATO and the trans-Atlantic alliance.\u201d\nThe most visible pushback against Washington came from Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany \u2014 who delivered an unusually passionate speech \u2014 and from her defense minister, Ursula von der Leyen. They spoke about the dangers of unilateral actions by major partners without discussing the consequences with allies.\nThey cited Mr. Trump\u2019s recent announcements that American troops would leave northern Syria and Afghanistan, as well as the administration\u2019s decision to suspend one of the last remaining arms-control agreements: the ban on land-based intermediate range missiles.\nThat decision affects European security, and there has been no alternative strategy, Ms. Merkel said. Abandoning the treaty, despite Russia\u2019s violations, helps decouple Germany from the American nuclear umbrella.\n\u201cWe sit there in the middle with the result,\u201d Ms. Merkel said.\nThe Syria pullout, she continued, could only help Russia and Iran. That view was echoed by the French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, who called American policy in Syria \u201ca mystery to me.\u201d\nWhen he was told by Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, that the United States would preserve \u201csome capacity\u201d in Syria, the normally diplomatic Mr. Le Drian said, sarcastically: \u201cOh, that\u2019s good news. I didn\u2019t know.\u201d And then he added acerbically, \u201cThat fills me with joy.\u201d\nVice President Mike Pence, who spoke after Ms. Merkel in Munich, met stony silence when he tried to pressure allies to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, a sign of the continuing anger at Washington\u2019s decision to scrap the deal unilaterally. European allies regard the pact as vital to European security and to the preservation of nuclear nonproliferation.\nEven more, the Europeans are angry that renewed American sanctions hurt European companies far more than any American ones.\nMs. Merkel said the split over Iran \u201cdepresses me very much,\u201d but she stressed that Europe and the United States were ultimately pursuing the same goal. She said the deal was one way to have influence over Iran \u2014 influence she clearly felt that Washington was throwing away.\nMr. Pence, in his speech, praised Mr. Trump and what he called the restoration of American leadership of the West. But Europeans were not convinced.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very odd to talk of American leadership of the alliance when it\u2019s Trump who has caused the crisis,\u201d said Marietje Schaake, a Dutch member of the European Parliament. \u201cThe Trump administration is seen by many Europeans as chiefly responsible for the tensions and the weakening of the West.\u201d\nNathalie Tocci, a senior adviser to the European foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, said that for Europeans, the divide went \u201cto the heart of how we view international relations and our national interest.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re small and understandably need partnership both inside Europe and outside, with NATO,\u201d Ms. Tocci said.\nBut that is also a sign of European weakness and division. \u201cWe want to believe it will be fine again later because we have no alternative,\u201d she said.\nIt means the dependency on the United States will continue, even as the Europeans look for ways not to depend on Washington as much, analysts say.\nThe Europeans \u201care beginning to do what we should,\u201d Ms. Tocci said \u2014 spend more on the military, discuss some sort of European army in coordination with NATO, think more strategically as Europe in the face of Russia and China. \u201cBut no one believes it\u2019s doable in the short run,\u201d she added, and many believe it\u2019s not easily doable at all.\nEuropeans are waiting for change in the White House, Ms. Tocci and others said.\n\u201cThe Europeans are holding their breath and thinking that it\u2019s maybe only two more years,\u201d said Victoria Nuland, a former senior American official. \u201cAt the same time, they don\u2019t want to do anything to wreck things further or to insult Trump personally and risk an angry response.\u201d\nA growing number of European voices warn that the current trans-Atlantic discord has more fundamental roots, and that there will be no returning to the past.\nMr. Trump is not the cause, said Norbert R\u00f6ttgen, the chairman of the German Parliament\u2019s foreign relations committee, but a symptom of the tectonic shifts in geopolitics that have led to the return of great power rivalry and centrifugal forces away from multilateralism.\n\u201cIn the post-Trump era, there is no return to the pre-Trump era,\u201d he said. \u201cThe status quo was Europe\u2019s security is guaranteed by the United States. That won\u2019t happen again.\u201d\nJan Techau, director of the Europe Program at the German Marshall Fund in Berlin, worries that the intervening gap will mean strategic vulnerability to Russia and China. The United States faces \u201ca superpower\u2019s dilemma,\u201d Mr. Techau said.\nIt has to \u201cpressure allies to do more,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the same time, the message has to be \u2018We will always be there.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cTrump does not understand the price he pays in strategic terms when he bashes his allies so publicly and openly,\u201d Mr. Techau added.\nIf there is any ambiguity, he said, Russia and China know that the security guarantee is no longer real. \u201cWhen that protection goes,\u201d he said, \u201cthen this strategic space is up for grabs.\u201d", "date": "Feb. 17, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/17/world/europe/trump-international-relations-munich.html", "tags": "american european open europeans \u201d trump europe rift \u2014 angry"}
