{"title": "Tokyo 2020 Olympic mascots unveiled after children's vote", "content": "Japan has chosen two futuristic fox-like creatures with \"supernatural\" powers as its mascots for the 2020 Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games. \nThe as-yet unnamed mascots won a vote among schoolchildren, beating four other equally surreal contenders. \nThe organising committee said 16,769 schools across the country took part in the ballot.\nThe mascots will greet visitors to the 2020 Games and help spread the Olympic and Paralympic spirit, it said.\nThey have a tough act to follow after Soohorang and Bandabi, the official mascots of the Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea. \nThe white tiger - a traditional symbol of strength and protection in South Korea - and black Asiatic bear have been a huge hit with sporting fans.\nAccording to the 2020 organising committee, their mascots have opposite personalities but \"respect each other and are very good friends\". \n\"They both have a great spirit of hospitality. They always try their best to cheer and encourage everyone.\"\nThe blue Olympic foxy creature has \"an old-fashioned charm that reflects tradition and also has a high-tech, cutting edge vibe\". \nIt has a strong sense of justice, perhaps indicated by the police-like appearance of its clothing or skin, and is very athletic. And it can teleport - though this would probably be considered cheating in the Games. \nThe pink Paralympic creation also has a special power - it can \"talk with stones and the wind\" and move things with its mind. \nIt has a \"dignified inner strength\", and while normally calm, it \"gets very powerful when needed\". \nFind out more about the winning and losing mascots in the quiz we published in December (if you can't see the quiz click here).", "date": "28 February 2018", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-43221985", "tags": "paralympic korea tokyo mascots unveiled committee olympic spirit children south games vote organising"}
