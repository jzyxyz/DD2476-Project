{"title": "Georgia Governor Signs \u2018Fetal Heartbeat\u2019 Abortion Law", "content": "Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia signed one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the nation on Tuesday, effectively banning abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, when doctors can usually start detecting a fetal heartbeat.\nGeorgia is the fourth state to enact a so-called fetal heartbeat law this year. Like in other states, it is expected to face a swift legal challenge, which supporters hope will lead to a re-evaluation by the United States Supreme Court of the landmark 1973 ruling that made abortion legal nationwide.\nMr. Kemp, a Republican, said in a signing ceremony at the State Capitol that his administration is prepared for a court fight.\n\u201cOur job is to do what is right, not what is easy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are called to be strong and courageous, and we will not back down.\u201d\nThe Georgia legislation is but the latest front in a wide-ranging battle over abortion rights being waged this year across Republican-controlled state legislatures in the Midwest and South. Conservative lawmakers see the realignment of the Supreme Court as presenting their best opportunity to overturn Roe v. Wade, the case that recognized a woman\u2019s constitutional right to an abortion.\nThe Georgia law, which would take effect in 2020, prohibits most abortions once doctors can discern a fetal heartbeat, a milestone that occurs before some women know they are pregnant. In practice, the limit on abortion in Georgia will now be six weeks of pregnancy, instead of 20 weeks.\nExceptions are allowed to prevent death or serious harm to the woman, and in cases of rape or incest in which a police report has been filed.\nMr. Kemp was narrowly elected last November, and the bill he signed on Tuesday was seen as crucial in maintaining the conservative support that led him into the governor\u2019s office. Mr. Kemp and the law\u2019s other supporters have brushed aside the risks of any political backlash.\n\u201cThis is a historic day for Georgia,\u201d Catherine Davis, an anti-abortion rights activist, said at Mr. Kemp\u2019s signing ceremony. \u201cThis is a day that many of us who have been in the pro-life fight for years and years and years didn\u2019t really think it would be possible, in light of the politics of the issue.\u201d\nThe law\u2019s critics said that they intend to target Republicans for defeat, especially those from the demographically shifting northern suburbs of Atlanta who supported the bill in the General Assembly.\n\u201cGeorgians will fight back in the courtroom and at the ballot box & win,\u201d Stacey Abrams, the Democratic nominee for governor in 2018, said in a tweet on Monday.\nGovernors in Kentucky, Mississippi and Ohio signed bills similar to Georgia\u2019s this year. They have not gone unchallenged: A federal judge is expected to hear a challenge to the Mississippi law later this month, and a judge in Kentucky blocked the law there.\nSimilar measures in Iowa and North Dakota have been found unconstitutional.\nLawmakers in South Carolina and Tennessee have pressed for fetal heartbeat bills of their own, and in Arkansas, the state government narrowed the time frame in which women can have abortions.\nAlabama is considering a different tack. Under a bill approved by the State House of Representatives last month, doctors would face up to 99 years in prison for performing an abortion in most instances. If a State Senate committee approves the measure, which does not currently include any exemptions for rape or incest, at a hearing on Wednesday, the full chamber could consider it as soon as Thursday.\nSupporters of abortion rights, including the American Civil Liberties Union, have vowed to challenge the Georgia law in court.\nElisabeth Smith, the chief counsel at the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement on Tuesday that the law was \u201cbafflingly unconstitutional.\u201d The Supreme Court has recognized a woman\u2019s right to an abortion until about 24 weeks into a pregnancy, the time when a fetus becomes viable outside the womb.\n\u201cBans like this have always been blocked by courts,\u201d said Ms. Smith, whose group has challenged the Mississippi abortion law. \u201cWe will be suing Georgia to make sure this law has the same fate.\u201d\nAlabama\u2019s law, if passed, would ban abortion outright, setting up perhaps the most direct conflict for the Supreme Court, which has become more conservative since the appointment of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh last year.\n\u201cHouse Bill 314 goes directly after Roe,\u201d State Representative Rich Wingo, one of the Alabama bill\u2019s supporters, said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to keep the bill as clean and as direct so there\u2019s not any ambiguity.\u201d\nIn the meantime, the Supreme Court, which in February temporarily blocked a Louisiana law that critics said would limit access to abortion, is considering whether to hear a challenge to that statute.", "date": "May 7, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/07/us/heartbeat-bill-georgia.html", "tags": "\u2018 heartbeat court signs kemp \u201d georgia abortion state bill governor fetal law"}
