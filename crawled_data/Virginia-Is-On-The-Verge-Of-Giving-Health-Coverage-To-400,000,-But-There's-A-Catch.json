{"title": "Virginia Is On The Verge Of Giving Health Coverage To 400,000, But There's A Catch", "content": "Virginia\u2019s Republican-led legislature is on the verge of doing something that would\u2019ve been almost unthinkable just a year ago: approving legislation that would use money from the Affordable Care Act to expand Medicaid to as many as 400,000 people.\nThat coverage expansion would come at a price for Democratic legislators, progressive activists and low-income Virginians, however. Any Medicaid expansion bill that makes it out of the General Assembly will carry with it new work requirements for Medicaid enrollees, a priority for the GOP at large and for President Donald Trump\u2019s administration.\nDemocrats in the Virginia legislature have tried in vain for six years to persuade their GOP counterparts that accepting federal dollars to extend Medicaid coverage to poor adults is the right thing to do. Accepting a work-requirements policy that would create bureaucratic obstacles to eligible Virginians appears to be the compromise needed to win the bigger fight.\n\u201cMost of the Democrats in the Senate are prepared to accept the work requirement in order to get expansion passed,\u201d said state Sen. Janet Howell (D), who represents parts of Fairfax and Arlington counties in Northern Virginia. \u201cWe have hundreds of thousands of Virginians who have no health insurance, largely because we in Virginia have a very stingy Medicaid program,\u201d she said.\n\u201cMy preference would be not to have a work requirement, but I don\u2019t see any way to get expansion passed unless we have one,\u201d Howell said. \nGov. Ralph Northam (D) has neither endorsed the work requirement nor rejected it, but he has said he won\u2019t accept a budget from the General Assembly that doesn\u2019t include Medicaid expansion.\nThe Medicaid expansion debate in Virginia spans back to 2013, when former Gov. Robert McDonnell (R) rejected Medicaid expansion. Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), who served from 2014 until January, was unable to bring the GOP-led legislature around on the issue. \nThen Northam won the gubernatorial election and Democrats gained 15 seats in the 100-member House of Delegates last November, altering the course of the debate and setting Medicaid expansion on a path to becoming a reality. The GOP now has a one-vote majority in both chambers of the legislature, and Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax (D) can cast tie-breaking votes in the 40-member Senate.\nThirty-one states and the District of Columbia have implemented Medicaid expansions. Louisiana was the most recent state to do so via legislation when Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) signed a bill in 2016. Maine voters also approved an expansion via a ballot initiative last year, although Gov. Paul LePage (R) thus far has refused to implement it.\nVirginia lawmakers are still working out the final form of the work requirement. The latest version, based on the policy enacted in Arkansas last month, would make a person\u2019s Medicaid coverage contingent on them working at least 20 hours a month for the first three months. The minimum number of hours gradually increases, eventually reaching 80 hours a month after a year on the program. There are other means of meeting this requirement, including being enrolled in school or a job-training training program, or volunteering.\nAnyone who fails to meet one of these standards for more than three months during a year losses their health coverage and has to wait until the following year to reapply. \nThere are numerous exceptions in the most recent version of the legislation, including for children, people over 55 years old, people with disabilities, people with \u201cserious mental illness,\u201d women who or are pregnant or have just given birth, those determined to be \u201cmedically frail\u201d and people who are the primary caregivers for children or adults with disabilities.\nThe Virginia House passed two budgets this year that included a Medicaid expansion, with every House Democrat and 19 Republicans voting for the version that passed this month. While most GOP legislators still oppose Medicaid expansion, two Senate Republicans have broken ranks with their leadership and expressed support for it, giving the legislation enough votes to pass the upper chamber. \nSen. Emmett Hanger Jr., who represents portions of the Shenandoah Valley and has expressed support for Medicaid expansion in the past, last month became the first Republican in the upper chamber this year to come out in favor of the policy. Weeks later, Sen. Frank Wagner (R) of Virginia Beach joined him. Both senators cited a work requirement as a prerequisite for their support. House Republicans who voted for expansion with a work requirement pitch it as reforming Medicaid, not simply enlarging it.\nThe deal is all but done except for some of the details, said Sen. George Barker (D), whose Northern Virginia district covers parts of Fairfax and Prince WIlliam counties and part of Alexandria.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there are any obstacles that are presenting a problem,\u201d said Barker. \u201cI think that once we all sit down together \u2015 and I\u2019ve already talked to some of my Republican colleagues who are on board as well as some others who are on the fence right now \u2015 I feel confident that we can reach agreement.\u201d\nThe impasse over Medicaid expansion remains the primary reason the General Assembly hasn\u2019t agreed on the state\u2019s two-year budget.\nThe work requirement provides Republicans with political cover for changing their position on Medicaid expansion, said John McGlennon, a government professor at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg.\nThis newfound support for Medicaid expansion among some Republicans is the result of a mix of other factors, including the party\u2019s poor showing during the House elections last year and specific regional issues, McGlennon said. \n\u201cRepublicans were really stunned that they lost the 15 seats in the House of Delegates, and they recognize they had to probably do something,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were getting a lot of pressure from the medical professionals in Southwest Virginia, where they\u2019re closing hospitals and there\u2019s no funding for clinics and doctors aren\u2019t getting paid.\u201d\nAs for the minority party in the House, McGlennon said, \u201cThe Democrats were willing to pass what the Republican Speaker was willing to swallow.\u201d\nAnd given the growing strength of the Democratic Party in Virginia, Democrats have reason to believe they can simply repeal the work requirement when they eventually take control of the legislature, McGlennon said.\nThe fact that Trump and Congress failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act last year also is a factor, said Del. David Toscano, who represents the Charlottesville area and is the Democratic Leader in the House of Delegates. \u201cGiven that, you have to make the best of it,\u201d he said. \nIn addition, those Republicans who now support Medicaid expansion also have come around to the Democratic arguments that expanding coverage, coupled with the infusion of federal money that comes with it, will be a boon for Virginia, Toscano said.\n\u201cPeople like the notion of Medicaid expansion because it\u2019s going to help a lot of people get access to health care they wouldn\u2019t otherwise have. So, for them, it is a moral imperative,\u201d Toscano said. \u201cBut when you start looking at the numbers, it becomes an economic imperative for the budget because it allows us to do things with federal dollars that we could not previously do.\u201d\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, the federal government pays at least 90 percent of the cost of those newly eligible for Medicaid. The House-passed bill includes an assessment on Virginia hospitals that would cover the state\u2019s share. \nIn addition, expanding Medicaid would enable Virginia to reduce spending on other programs that finance health care for uninsured people, freeing up more than $370 million the state can use for other priorities.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not chicken feed, and it gets used to pay for things like teacher raises,\u201d Toscano said.\nAnd if Virginia\u2019s experience with Medicaid expansion matches that of other states, the incoming federal money would provide a boost to the economy. It could create about 30,000 jobs in the state, according to the Commonwealth Institute for Fiscal Analysis, a Richmond-based think tank.\nThe Affordable Care Act calls for Medicaid to be expanded to anyone who earns up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, which is about $16,000 for a single person. But in 2012, the Supreme Court ruled that states could refuse the Medicaid expansion, leaving uninsured millions the ACA would have covered.\nCurrently, childless adults who don\u2019t have a disability can\u2019t qualify for Medicaid in Virginia, no matter how poor they are. \nLow-income parents are eligible if they make up to 38 percent of the poverty level, which is less than $4,600 a year. Pregnant women earning up to 205 percent of poverty \u2015 about $25,000 \u2015 can sign up for Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. Adults with disabilities are eligible for Medicaid if their incomes don\u2019t exceed 80 percent of poverty, or about $9,700, and if their assets are worth less than $2,000. \nIn Virginia, the proposed expansion would provide coverage to almost 400,000 people, according to the state\u2019s Department of Medical Assistance Services.\n\u201cWe\u2019re really excited for people to get insurance so that they can get to the specialists they need to get the care that they need for their chronic disease,\u201d said Paula Tomko, executive director of New Canton-based Central Virginia Health Services, which served about 43,000 patients at 16 locations last year. \nTomko said 32 percent of its patients, or 13,000 people, would be eligible for Medicaid under the expansion.\n\u201cWe see how much difference access to coverage can make in caring for a patient,\u201d Tomko said.\nAdding a work requirement to the program, however, likely means fewer people will get help. Kentucky, which this year became the first state to impose\u00a0such a requirement, estimates that its new work requirement, along with other policies, will reduce the Medicaid rolls by as many as 95,000 people, for example.\n\u201cThe potential for loss of coverage is going to be significant,\u201d said Cindy Mann, a partner at the consulting firm Manatt Health in Washington D.C., who oversaw the Medicaid program under President Barack Obama. The Obama administration refused to grant states\u2019 requests for work requirements, arguing that limiting benefits to people who are working was illegal under Medicaid\u2019s statutory mandate to provide health care.\nThe Trump administration opened the door to including a work requirement in January when the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services notified states it would consider approving such policies.\nArkansas, Indiana and Kentucky have already received approval for work requirements. Utah, Arizona, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, New Hampshire and Wisconsin have also applied for them, and other states are sure to follow.\nWhile Trump administration officials and Republicans at the state level tout work requirements as a means to lift low-income people out of poverty and improve their health, there is scant evidence to support these claims. The vast majority of Medicaid enrollees and people who\u2019d be eligible in non-expansion states are working or in families with at least one worker. \n\u201cThere\u2019s really no indication that the problem is people not having sufficient motivation,\u201d said Mann. \u201cPeople may lack skill training, people may lack day care, they may lack transportation \u2015 and there is no additional support available.\u201d \nThe policy also unjustly tars low-income people as \u201cslackers\u201d who refuse to help themselves, said Kay Crane, CEO of Danville-based Piedmont Access to Health Services, which operates community health centers in Southside Virginia, near the North Carolina border.\n\u201cUnless you\u2019re in their shoes and you understand their struggle, it\u2019s real easy to sit back and say, \u2018Oh, they ought to get a job,\u2019\u201d Crane said. \u201cMany of our patients that we\u2019re talking about work one, if not two, jobs just to put food on the table.\u201d Forcing them to prove they\u2019re working could merely tie them up in red tape, making it difficult even for people who qualify for Medicaid to get and keep it, she said.\nImplementing and enforcing work requirements also is expensive for states. The version adopted by the Virginia House of Delegates, for instance, will cost the state $21.5 million over two years, according to data compiled\u00a0by the Commonwealth Institute for Fiscal Analysis.\nBut if this is what it takes to ensure that hundreds of thousands of Virginians gain access to health care, it\u2019ll be worth it, Tomko said. \u201cI would rather work through an onerous process for these folks to have access than not have it.\u201d\nClarification:\u00a0Language in this story has been amended to reflect that state Sen.
