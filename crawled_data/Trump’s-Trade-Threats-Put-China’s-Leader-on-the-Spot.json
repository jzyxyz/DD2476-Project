If he retreats and offers significant concessions, however, Mr. Xi risks looking weak and inviting criticism in a political system that has fanned nationalist and anti-American sentiment.\nShi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing, said that Chinese leaders had been so successful over the years in deflecting criticism of the country\u2019s trade practices in the United States that they may have been slow to realize the gravity of the confrontation brewing.\n\u201cPeople in the U.S. and China have for years said the wolf is coming, the wolf is coming, but the wolf hasn\u2019t come,\u201d he said. \u201cThis time, the wolf is coming. And how to deal with the wolf? I would say that there is still no consensus.\u201d\nAnalysts in Washington and Beijing say that Mr. Xi will want to demonstrate resolve by standing up to Mr. Trump while finding a way to steer the countries away from a broader confrontation that could slow China\u2019s rise and undermine its global ambitions.\n\u201cXi\u2019s done an excellent job walking the thin line between Trump\u2019s aggressive rhetoric and protecting his own strong nationalist image,\u201d said Cliff Kupchan, the Washington-based chairman of Eurasia Group, a consultancy.\nReferring to Mr. Xi and his advisers, he added: \u201cThe question has always been how skilled are these guys as policymakers. Now they are going to be tested. Can the \u2018helmsman\u2019 pull with both oars?\u201d\nMr. Trump\u2019s determination to carry out pledges from his presidential campaign \u2014 in which he repeatedly accused China of \u201craping\u201d the United States and its workers \u2014 has frustrated Mr. Xi\u2019s team. They must now decide how to respond to a mercurial American president who heaps praise on Mr. Xi personally even as he rails against a trade relationship that they argue has benefited both nations \u2014 a view endorsed by Mr. Trump\u2019s predecessors and, until recently, by much of the American business establishment.\nA major reason for Mr. Xi\u2019s frustration, analysts said, is that Beijing feels it has already made concessions to Mr. Trump by tightening sanctions against North Korea over its nuclear program, and at considerable cost to Chinese companies. Chinese officials had assumed that would keep Mr. Trump from following through on his trade threats, as he had suggested more than once.\nWhen it became clear this year that cooperation on North Korea would not be enough to placate trade hawks in the Trump administration, Mr. Xi redoubled efforts to head off the tariffs, dispatching his senior economic adviser, Liu He, to Washington last month.\nThat mission ended, however, in a humiliating snub. Though Mr. Liu was acting as Mr. Xi\u2019s personal envoy, Mr. Trump declined to meet him. Instead, the White House announced tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, including from China, on the first day of his visit. In another sign of Mr. Xi\u2019s trust in him, Mr. Liu was promoted last week to vice premier overseeing the economy.\nMichael Pillsbury, director of the Center for Chinese Strategy at the Hudson Institute in Washington, said Mr. Xi had turned to respected veterans of diplomacy with the United States by elevating Mr. Liu, who studied at Seton Hall and Harvard, and Wang Qishan, the new vice president, who has longstanding ties with Wall Street.\nHe noted, however, that they had become Mr. Xi\u2019s point men on the relationship at a moment when their experience may be a poor guide to Washington, just as two decades of bipartisan American support for deeper trade with China is crumbling in favor of a more protectionist, \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach.\n\u201cThey\u2019re having a hard time adjusting to the new owners,\u201d said Mr. Pillsbury, who served as an adviser to the Trump campaign.\nChina has warned that it will retaliate, tit-for-tat, against tariffs and other measures. Even before the announcement of punitive measures in Washington on Thursday, the Ministry of Commerce in Beijing issued a statement sharply criticizing the Trump administration.\n\u201cWe firmly oppose the unilateralism and trade protectionism of the United States,\u201d it said. \u201cChina will absolutely not sit back and watch as its legal rights and interests get hurt.\u201d\nHu Xijin, the editor in chief of Global Times, a state newspaper with a nationalist bent, signaled that the government would begin by raising barriers to American agricultural products, practically taunting American soybean farmers. \u201cSoybeans of Brazil, Argentina and Russia are good alternatives,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.\nHe added that while a trade war would benefit no one, \u201cChina is far more resilient than the U.S. to the pain.\u201d\nIn the past, the Chinese government has succeeded in blunting American complaints about its trade policies \u2014 and over the giant trade imbalance between the two countries \u2014 by enlisting the support of big business in the United States to head off calls for punitive measures while making relatively small concessions and dangling the prospect of further action.\nIn a news conference this week, Premier Li Keqiang struck a familiar, conciliatory tone, defending the global trading system and promising to take additional steps to open China\u2019s economy to American services and products.\n\u201cWhat we hope is that cool heads and rational actions will prevail, instead of emotions or impulses holding sway,\u201d he said.\nSuch words might have led to negotiations in the past, but Mr. Trump appears less interested in negotiations than the Chinese leadership is.\nIt is also unclear what exactly the Chinese government could do to mollify the Trump administration. Two people briefed on bilateral discussions said Chinese officials had asked for a to-do list they could work with, but the administration has not provided one.\nMr. Xi has made clear that he envisions China as a leading power on the world stage, able to dictate terms as the United States did for decades. And some of his supporters have argued that Mr. Trump\u2019s policies \u2014 especially his willingness to break with longstanding allies in Asia on trade \u2014 have presented China with an opportunity to make great strides toward that goal.\nBut a trade war that hurts the Chinese economy could slow Mr. Xi\u2019s agenda and roil Chinese politics in unpredictable ways.\nMr. Pillsbury, the author of \u201cThe Hundred-Year Marathon: China\u2019s Secret Strategy to Replace America as the Global Superpower,\u201d said there was a divide in the Chinese political establishment that mirrored the split in the United States between \u201cglobalists,\u201d who favor trade and a rules-based international order, and \u201cnationalists,\u201d who argue that those things are sapping American strength.\nIn China, he argued, a major confrontation over trade would be likely to strengthen those who believe the United States is seeking to block China\u2019s rise.\nHu Angang, an economist at the School of Public Policy and Management at Tsinghua University who advises the government, said that Mr. Trump\u2019s decision could begin a vicious cycle that would hurt America\u2019s reputation more than China\u2019s economy.\n\u201cI think Trump is not professional; he doesn\u2019t understand the global situation,\u201d he said.\nMr. Hu added that China may be replacing the United States, with Mr. Xi picking up the banner of global cooperation on trade, climate and other issues that Mr. Trump\u2019s predecessors had carried.\n\u201cAfter 40 years of being students, learning from our teacher,\u201d he said, \u201cnow it is the time for the teacher to learn from its students.\u201d", "date": "March 22, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/22/world/asia/donald-trump-tariffs-china.html", "tags": "put spot xi china united \u201d trump chinese trade leader threats said"}
