{"title": "In Russia Inquiry, Lawyers Tell Trump to Refuse Mueller Interview", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Lawyers for President Trump have advised him against sitting down for a wide-ranging interview with the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, according to four people briefed on the matter, raising the specter of a monthslong court battle over whether the president must answer questions under oath.\nHis lawyers are concerned that the president, who has a history of making false statements and contradicting himself, could be charged with lying to investigators. Their stance puts them at odds with Mr. Trump, who has said publicly and privately that he is eager to speak with Mr. Mueller as part of the investigation into possible ties between his associates and Russia\u2019s election interference, and whether he obstructed justice.\nMr. Trump\u2019s decision about whether to speak to prosecutors, expected in the coming weeks, will shape one of the most consequential moments of the investigation. Refusing to sit for an interview opens the possibility that Mr. Mueller will subpoena the president to testify before a grand jury, setting up a court fight that would drastically escalate the investigation and could be decided by the Supreme Court.\nRejecting an interview with Mr. Mueller also carries political consequences. It would be certain to prompt accusations that the president is hiding something, and a court fight could prolong the special counsel inquiry, casting a shadow over Republicans as November\u2019s midterm elections approach or beyond into the president\u2019s re-election campaign.\nBut John Dowd, the longtime Washington defense lawyer hired last summer to represent Mr. Trump in the investigation, wants to rebuff an interview request, as do Mr. Dowd\u2019s deputy, Jay Sekulow, and many West Wing advisers, according to the four people. The lawyers and aides believe the special counsel might be unwilling to subpoena the president and set off a showdown with the White House that Mr. Mueller could lose in court.\nThey are convinced that Mr. Mueller lacks the legal standing to question Mr. Trump about some of the matters he is investigating, like the president\u2019s role in providing a misleading response last summer to a New York Times article about a meeting Mr. Trump\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr. had with Russians offering dirt on Hillary Clinton. The advisers have also argued that on other matters \u2014 like the allegations that the president asked James B. Comey, then the F.B.I. director, to end the investigation into the former national security adviser Michael T. Flynn \u2014 the president acted within his constitutional authority and cannot be questioned about acts that were legal.\nOne of the few voices arguing for cooperating with Mr. Mueller is Ty Cobb, the White House lawyer whom Mr. Trump also brought on to deal with Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation. Since Mr. Cobb was hired in July, he has argued that the White House should do everything possible to cooperate with Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation.\nBut Mr. Dowd has taken the lead on dealing with the special counsel about an interview and has been discussing the matter with Mr. Mueller\u2019s office since December.\nOthers close to Mr. Trump have also cautioned him against a freewheeling interview. Marc E. Kasowitz, the president\u2019s longtime personal lawyer from New York who initially dealt with the special counsel after Mr. Mueller took over the Russia investigation last May, has also consistently said that the president should not agree to the interview.\nChris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey who led the presidential transition team until just after the election, bluntly said last week that Mr. Trump should reject a request to be questioned.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the president of the United States, unless there are credible allegations \u2014 which I don\u2019t believe there are \u2014 should be sitting across from a special counsel,\u201d he said on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d\nNewt Gingrich, the former House speaker and an informal adviser to Mr. Trump, echoed that advice.\n\u201cThe idea of putting Trump in a room with five or six hardened, very clever lawyers, all of whom are trying to trick him and trap him, would be a very, very bad idea,\u201d Mr. Gingrich said last month on \u201cFox and Friends.\u201d\nPresidents have often agreed to speak with federal prosecutors who are investigating their actions or those close to them. But President Richard M. Nixon refused to turn over to the special prosecutor investigating him tapes of incriminating conversations with aides. The matter eventually went before the Supreme Court, which ruled in 1974 that the president, like every American, was not above the law and had to comply with the special prosecutor\u2019s request.\n\u201cThe upshot of the Nixon tapes case was that any president is going to have an extremely hard time resisting a request from a law enforcement officer,\u201d said Neal K. Katyal, an acting solicitor general in the Obama administration and a partner at the law firm Hogan Lovells.\n\u201cIn general,\u201d he added, \u201cpresidents do sit for interviews or respond to requests from prosecutors because they take their constitutional responsibility to faithfully execute the laws seriously, and running away from a prosecutor isn\u2019t consistent with faithfully executing the laws.\u201d\nMr. Trump\u2019s penchant for bravado has been a factor that his lawyers must contend with. The president has bragged to some aides that he would be able to clear himself if he talked to Mr. Mueller\u2019s team.\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it, actually,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House last month, though he added, almost as an afterthought, that an interview would be \u201csubject to my lawyers, and all of that.\u201d\nWhen pressed, he also said he would be willing to be questioned under oath. Questioning by Mr. Mueller would not be under oath, though lying to federal investigators is a crime.\nDespite his penchant for exaggerations and falsehoods in public remarks, Mr. Trump has appeared far more aware of the legal risk of making false statements when he has been deposed in civil cases related to his businesses.\nIn one deposition related to a libel case that Mr. Trump brought against the journalist Tim O\u2019Brien, Mr. Trump admitted more than two dozen times under oath that he had lied in the past about a range of subjects. Mr. Trump ultimately lost the case.\nSince last summer, the White House has been in what Mr. Cobb has called \u201ctotal cooperation mode.\u201d He has issued few, if any, objections as Mr. Mueller\u2019s team interviewed senior White House officials and reviewed reams of emails and other internal documents. The White House was operating on a strategy that, since Mr. Trump had nothing to hide, full cooperation was the best chance to bring the investigation to a quick, decisive end.\nMr. Cobb had told the president and the public that the Mueller inquiry would be over by the end of 2017, or soon after. But a month into 2018, it remains unclear when Mr. Mueller will wrap up the bulk of his work.\nPrivately, people close to the president have conceded that assuring Mr. Trump that the investigation would end by a certain date was primarily aimed at keeping him from antagonizing Mr. Mueller on his Twitter feed or in interviews.", "date": "Feb. 5, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/05/us/politics/trump-lawyers-special-counsel-interview.html", "tags": "inquiry tell investigation \u201d trump interview refuse lawyers russia special mueller"}
