There was no change in prices in the three months to the end of January compared with the previous quarter.\nEarlier in January, a survey by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) found their members thought the outlook for the housing market over the next three months was the worst for 20 years.\nA net balance of 28% of RICS members expected sales to fall, the most downbeat reading since records started in October 1998. \nRobert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said: \"The economic outlook remains unusually uncertain.\n\"However, if the economy continues to grow at a modest pace, with the unemployment rate and borrowing costs remaining close to current levels, we would expect UK house prices to rise at a low single-digit pace in 2019.\"\nThese predictions show an average for UK house prices, but each of the commentators point out that the picture can vary significantly in different parts of the country. It can also vary in different neighbourhoods of the same town.\nRead more: Will the value of your home change in 2019?\nSamuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the slowdown was \"a sentiment-led deterioration in house price growth, which chimes with the drop in measures of consumers' confidence since November, when it became clear that the [Brexit] withdrawal agreement would not be ratified seamlessly\".\nHe added: \"Looking ahead, increasing numbers of prospective house-buyers likely will wait a few months for Brexit uncertainty to fade, forcing sellers to lower asking prices to attract braver buyers in the interim. As a result, year-over-year declines in house prices in the near term should not be ruled out.\" ", "date": "31 January 2019", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-47063224", "tags": "january house housing try calculator could six-year nationwide live prices buy lowwhere rate uk price near see growth rent outlook afford"}
