Discussions about a potential acquisition of Wow by Icelandair Group also fell apart in November. \nThe airline reached a preliminary agreement in November for an investment by Indigo Partners, a private equity firm in Phoenix. But those talks were canceled last week. Wow also tried unsuccessfully to restart discussions with Icelandair. \nWow\u2019s bondholders agreed this week to convert the debt into equity, and the company had been in discussions about restructuring until Thursday\u2019s announcement that it would cease operations altogether. \nWow Air\u2019s financial struggles had been a source of concern in Iceland. The finance minister said contingency plans were in place if the airline collapsed, including assistance for stranded passengers, but added that the government would not rescue the airline, according to local news reports. \nThe airline\u2019s issues also prompted the Iceland Pilots\u2019 Union to write to Iceland\u2019s press society asking for an inquiry into the critical reporting of Wow\u2019s finances, to see whether the journalists had received benefits from competitors. The press association responded by saying that trying to trace the company\u2019s problems to journalists would be like going \u201cto a goat house to look for wool.\u201d \nDuring Wow\u2019s discussions over potential financing, the airline reduced its fleet of 20 aircraft to 11 by selling four airplanes and negotiating the return of some aircraft to leasing companies. \nWow Air\u2019s demise followed a series of airline shutdowns in Europe, where the aviation industry has expanded at a furious pace, offering passengers longer trips at cheaper prices. But many of these airlines, already grappling with narrow profit margins, have faced fluctuating oil prices and bills piling up after summer holiday periods.\nPrimera, another low-cost airline offering trans-Atlantic flights, collapsed in October. The company, based in Latvia and Denmark, filed for bankruptcy after struggling with higher fuel costs and issues with its aircraft. Around the same time, airlines based in Switzerland, Belgium and Germany also folded. \nFlybmi, a British regional airline, and Germania, a budget airline based in Berlin, filed for bankruptcy in February. Flybe, another British airline, was bought out in January by a consortium that includes Virgin Atlantic.
