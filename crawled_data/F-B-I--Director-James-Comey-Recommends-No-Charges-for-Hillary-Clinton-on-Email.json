{"title": "F.B.I. Director James Comey Recommends No Charges for Hillary Clinton on Email", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, on Tuesday recommended no criminal charges against Hillary Clinton for her handling of classified information while she was secretary of state, lifting an enormous legal cloud from her presidential campaign less than two hours before she boarded Air Force One for her first joint campaign appearance with President Obama.\nBut on a day of political high drama in Washington, Mr. Comey rebuked Mrs. Clinton as being \u201cextremely careless\u201d in using a private email address and server. He raised questions about her judgment, contradicted statements she has made about her email practices, said it was possible that hostile foreign governments had gained access to her account, and declared that a person still employed by the government \u2014 Mrs. Clinton left the State Department in 2013 \u2014 could have faced disciplinary action for doing what she did.\nTo warrant a criminal charge, Mr. Comey said, there had to be evidence that Mrs. Clinton intentionally transmitted or willfully mishandled classified information. The F.B.I. found neither, and as a result, he said, \u201cour judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case.\u201d\nThe Justice Department is highly likely to accept the F.B.I.\u2019s guidance, which a law enforcement official said also cleared three top aides of Mrs. Clinton who were implicated in the case: Jake Sullivan, Huma Abedin and Cheryl D. Mills. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said last week that she would accept the recommendation of the F.B.I. and career prosecutors in the case after a storm of criticism about an impromptu meeting between her and former President Bill Clinton on an airport tarmac in Phoenix.\nMr. Comey\u2019s 15-minute announcement, delivered with no advance warning only three days after his investigators interviewed Mrs. Clinton in the case, riveted official Washington and is likely to reverberate for the rest of the campaign. In offices across the capital, all eyes turned to television screens to hear the outcome of a yearlong investigation that could have thrown the 2016 presidential election into disarray and changed history.\nAs Mr. Comey strode to the lectern at the F.B.I. headquarters at 11 a.m., Mrs. Clinton was waiting backstage a few blocks away to address the National Education Association. Her aides said she did not know what Mr. Comey was going to say. Five minutes into Mr. Comey\u2019s remarks, and before he announced that the F.B.I. would not seek charges, a smiling Mrs. Clinton began her speech.\nBy 2:45 p.m., she and Mr. Obama were descending the stairs of Air Force One for a campaign rally in Charlotte, N.C., while back in Washington the State Department spokesman, John Kirby, was fending off questions from reporters about what Mr. Comey described as the department\u2019s lax security in handling classified information.\nWhite House officials said Mr. Obama also did not know about Mr. Comey\u2019s plans ahead of time. The F.B.I. director said he did not coordinate the statement with the Justice Department or any other agency. \u201cThey do not know what I am about to say,\u201d he declared.\nA Republican former federal prosecutor, Mr. Comey seemed at first to be laying the groundwork for some kind of legal charge. Speaking sternly, and in far more detail than he usually does, he listed several previously undisclosed findings from the F.B.I.\u2019s investigation:\n\u25a0 Of 30,000 emails Mrs. Clinton handed over to the State Department, 110 contained information that was classified at the time she sent or received them. Of those, Mr. Comey said, \u201ca very small number\u201d bore markings that identified them as classified. This finding is at odds with Mrs. Clinton\u2019s repeated assertions that none of the emails were classified at the time she sent or received them. The F.B.I. did not disclose the topics of the classified emails, but a number of the 110 are believed to have involved drone strikes.\n\u25a0 The F.B.I. discovered \u201cseveral thousand\u201d work-related emails that were not in the original trove of 30,000 turned over by Mrs. Clinton to the State Department. Three of those contained information that agencies have concluded was classified, though Mr. Comey said he did not believe Mrs. Clinton deliberately deleted or withheld them from investigators.\n\u25a0 In saying that it was \u201cpossible\u201d that hostile foreign governments had gained access to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s personal account, Mr. Comey noted that she used her mobile device extensively while traveling outside the United States, including trips \u201cin the territory of sophisticated adversaries.\u201d\n\u25a0 Mrs. Clinton used multiple private servers for her personal and government business, not just a single server at her home in New York that has been the focus of media reporting for more than a year. Her use of these servers \u2014 some of which were taken out of service and stored \u2014 made the F.B.I.\u2019s job enormously complicated as it struggled to put together, in Mr. Comey\u2019s words, a jigsaw puzzle with \u201cmillions of email fragments\u201d in it.\nDespite all that, Mr. Comey said the F.B.I. did not find that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s conduct revealed \u201cintentional misconduct or indications of disloyalty to the United States or efforts to obstruct justice.\u201d But a person in her position, he said, \u201cshould have known that an unclassified system was no place\u201d for the emails she was sending. And he said it raised troubling questions about how the State Department handled classified information.\nThe White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, declined to comment, except to say it was clear from Mr. Comey\u2019s remarks that \u201cthey\u2019ve looked at this in excruciating detail.\u201d Mr. Obama, he said, remained \u201centhusiastic\u201d about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s candidacy.\nThe Clinton campaign clearly hoped that the announcement would bring to a close a saga that has haunted Mrs. Clinton since March 2015, when the existence of her personal email account surfaced.\n\u201cWe are pleased that the career officials handling this case have determined that no further action by the department is appropriate,\u201d said the campaign\u2019s spokesman, Brian Fallon. \u201cAs the secretary has long said, it was a mistake to use her personal email and she would not do it again. We are glad that this matter is now resolved.\u201d\nRepublicans seized on Mr. Comey\u2019s sharp criticism, saying it raised doubts about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s fitness for high office. Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, asserted in a post on Twitter that David H. Petraeus, the former C.I.A. director, had been charged for doing far less than Mrs. Clinton, and the lack of charges showed that the system was \u201crigged.\u201d\nIn fact, F.B.I. officials have long said that what Mr. Petraeus did \u2014 knowingly handing a diary with classified information to his biographer and lover, then lying about it to investigators \u2014 was worse than what Mrs. Clinton did. In the Petraeus case, the F.B.I. recommended a felony indictment, but the Justice Department allowed him to plead to a misdemeanor. The deal that Mr. Petraeus received shadowed Mrs. Clinton\u2019s case from the start because it appeared to set a higher bar for bringing charges against her.\n\u201cIn looking back at our investigations into the mishandling or removal of classified information,\u201d Mr. Comey said, \u201cwe cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts.\u201d\nCongressional Republicans swiftly called for the F.B.I. to release more details about its findings. \u201cIf it wants to avoid giving the impression that the F.B.I. was pulling punches,\u201d said Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, \u201cthe agency must now be more transparent than ever in releasing information.\u201d\nSpeaker Paul D. Ryan was equally critical. \u201cWhile I respect the professionals at the F.B.I., this announcement defies explanation,\u201d he said in a Twitter post. \u201cNo one should be above the law.\u201d\nFor an agency that seemed to be in no rush, the F.B.I.\u2019s investigation wrapped up quickly. By the time the investigators interviewed Mrs. Clinton in three and a half hours of questioning on Saturday, they had compiled months of findings. Mrs. Clinton appeared to say nothing to contradict what they had already discovered about how the private server was used, a law enforcement official said. The investigators then worked with Mr. Comey through the holiday weekend to review her testimony and determine whether there was any new information that might warrant criminal charges, law enforcement officials said. They found none.\nFor weeks, F.B.I. agents expected the investigation would not yield charges. They shared Mr. Comey\u2019s conclusion that Mrs. Clinton had showed poor judgment but that she had not committed a crime.\nIn the spring, Mr. Comey declared that the campaign calendar would not dictate the pace of the investigation. But the Democratic National Convention begins on July 25 in Philadelphia, and F.B.I. officials did not want to be seen as influencing the outcome of the election after the nomination.\nMr. Comey\u2019s announcement was believed to be the first time that the F.B.I. had ever publicly disclosed its recommendations to the Justice Department about whether to charge someone in any high-profile case, let alone a presidential candidate. His decision to announce the results of the investigation was made before the uproar over Ms. Lynch\u2019s meeting with Mr. Clinton, according to a law enforcement official. He decided to make his findings public, the official said, because he wanted to make the F.B.I.\u2019s position clear before referring the case to the Justice Department.\nWhile the F.B.I.\u2019s recommendation spares Mrs. Clinton and her aides criminal charges, it does not remove the possibility that they could be denied security clearances if Mrs. Clinton is elected and she appoints them to jobs that require such clearance. The State Department plans to conduct its own administrative review after the Justice Department acts.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t share the broad assessment made of our institution that there\u2019s a lax culture here when it comes to protecting classified information,\u201d said Mr. Kirby, the State Department spokesman. \u201cWe take it very, very seriously.\u201d", "date": "July 5, 2016", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/06/us/politics/hillary-clinton-fbi-email-comey.html", "tags": "f.b.i \u201c classified comey recommends hillary clinton director department email charges james mrs."}
