If we don't take urgent action on air pollution, we will never come close to achieving sustainable development,\" said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of WHO.  \nIndia has seen rapid development in the past two decades, but it has come at the cost of increasing pollution.\nWeak industrial regulation means that factories do not follow pollution-control measures. Rapid construction has also contributed to high levels of PM2.5.\nLast year, a public health emergency was declared in Delhi as pollution levels crossed 70 times the safe limit.\nSeveral Chinese cities were also listed in the report as highly polluted but the data for those places was four or five years old.\nMaria Neira, WHO's head of public health, said India should follow the example of China, which had made big improvements in air quality.\n\"There is a big step at the government level [in China] declaring war on air pollution,\" Ms Neira said. \"One of the reasons for that is that the health argument was very strongly presented, and the fact that the citizens were really breathing air that was totally unacceptable.\n\"We would be very happy if we would see a similar movement now in India which is one of the countries for which we are particularly concerned.\"", "date": "2 May 2018", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-43972155", "tags": "study world india polluted pollution cities levels air dominate list health"}
