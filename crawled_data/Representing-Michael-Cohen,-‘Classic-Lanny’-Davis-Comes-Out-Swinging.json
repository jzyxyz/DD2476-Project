{"title": "Representing Michael Cohen, \u2018Classic Lanny\u2019 Davis Comes Out Swinging", "content": "Lanny J. Davis\u2019s client list, like his quintessentially Washington career as an all-purpose lawyer, lobbyist, crisis consultant and television-talker, is lengthy, international \u2014 and more than occasionally contradictory.\nMr. Davis has represented Harvey Weinstein and Penn State, a Ukrainian oligarch with links to President Trump\u2019s indicted former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and an Ivory Coast strongman whom Mr. Davis today insists he was trying to help dislodge as part of a secret arrangement with the State Department.\nNow, Mr. Davis \u2014 best known as a high-profile spinner for Bill and Hillary Clinton, first in the White House and then on any cable news network that would have him \u2014 has set off on perhaps his least likely partnership: He is defending Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer, who released a recording this week of a conversation that suggests Mr. Trump knew about hush money payments to a former Playboy model.\nIt was Mr. Davis who went on CNN on Tuesday evening to tell the world about their gambit. \u201cDon\u2019t believe me, I\u2019m a Democrat,\u201d Mr. Davis said, addressing \u201cred America\u201d as he stared into the camera. \u201cBelieve your own ears.\u201d\nThat strategy, those who know Mr. Davis say, is \u201cclassic Lanny,\u201d for better or worse, a sort of valedictory turn for an avatar of the capital\u2019s forever-booming image-buffing industry. His book\u2019s subtitle, lifted from his time as Mr. Clinton\u2019s special counsel and as a self-described crisis guru, advises: \u201cTell it early, tell it all, tell it yourself.\u201d\nFor Mr. Cohen, this has translated to an aggressive defense in the news media \u2014 as much reputational management as legal wrangling \u2014 responding in kind to Mr. Trump and his team where other lawyers might be inclined to lie low, with federal prosecutors watching closely.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a strategy of crisis management. But really, it\u2019s the only strategy of crisis management. Because bad news is coming out,\u201d Mr. Davis, 72, said in an interview, wondering aloud why Mr. Trump had not likewise owned up to his own behavior. \u201cIt was an embarrassing episode in his life, but so be it. As my mother would say in the Jewish vocabulary, \u2018Sue me!\u2019\u201d\nMr. Davis has legions of bipartisan critics, including Democrats who wince at his post-White House work and Republicans who fear he is plotting against Mr. Trump on the Clintons\u2019 behalf.\nThen there is this: So extensive is Mr. Davis\u2019s client history that he has represented another party involved in Mr. Cohen\u2019s drama \u2014 the parent company of The National Enquirer, which paid the former model, Karen McDougal, $150,000 in 2016 for her story of an affair with Mr. Trump and did not publish anything about it during the campaign.\nAs part of his work for the company, Mr. Davis said, he met with journalists from The Associated Press to \u201clet them judge whether the reason not to publish\u201d a particular article about Mr. Trump was part of a so-called catch-and-kill playbook to protect him.\n\u201cAll I did was pass along the documents that the editor said was the reason why he didn\u2019t print the story \u2014 the lack of credibility of the source,\u201d Mr. Davis said. \u201cNever was there a sentence uttered that you should kill this story. That\u2019s what I do: facts, facts, facts.\u201d\nEven before he took on Mr. Cohen\u2019s case, Mr. Davis\u2019s flood-the-zone model of representation had become especially common in the Trump administration\u2019s recent months, touching a series of Trump-branded scandals. Lawyers like Rudolph W. Giuliani (working for the president) and Michael Avenatti (working for Stephanie Clifford, a pornographic film actress who also received a hush payment from Mr. Cohen) have often seemed to understand their roles more as ubiquitous advocates and jack-of-all-problems defenders than simply traditional legal minds, much as Mr. Cohen viewed himself, until recently, in service of Mr. Trump.\nMr. Davis said he would not do anything to undercut Mr. Cohen\u2019s position with prosecutors. And he pledged to step back, for now, from public remarks about the recording.\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to speak any further or go on any more shows,\u201d Mr. Davis said. \u201cThe tape speaks much better than I do.\u201d\nBut then he spoke further. He offered Mr. Trump and his team unsolicited crisis management counsel from his literary canon. \u201cThe mantra \u2014 tell it early, tell it all, tell it yourself \u2014 the \u2018it\u2019 is the truth,\u201d he said. \u201cNow what did Rudy Giuliani do? He and Trump walked into the trap thinking they could get away with lying.\u201d\nIn an interview, Mr. Giuliani disputed that the tape had damaged the president, suggesting that Mr. Davis was out of his depth and that Mr. Cohen had sacrificed credibility by recording Mr. Trump.\n\u201cHe\u2019s basically destroying his client as a witness because he really isn\u2019t a criminal lawyer. He\u2019s playing it like a shill as opposed to a lawyer,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said of Mr. Davis. \u201cHis whole theory \u2014 \u2018you bring it all out\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s great, but now the guy\u2019s ruined as a witness. What prosecutor is going to use him?\u201d\nThe recording, which was broadcast Tuesday by CNN, provides some details on payments to Ms. McDougal. Mr. Cohen can be heard telling Mr. Trump that he will need to establish a company to arrange the payments. Mr. Trump appears to say, \u201cPay with cash,\u201d before Mr. Cohen says, \u201cNo, no.\u201d The word \u201ccheck\u201d can be heard, but the speaker is not clear.\nMr. Giuliani said an analysis of the audio showed Mr. Trump had said \u201cdon\u2019t\u201d before \u201cpay with cash.\u201d \u201cI had to play it three times,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve done a lot of tapes. Hours of them \u2014 Mafia people. Experts slow it down a little bit, it becomes clearer.\u201d\nBefore the tape\u2019s release, Mr. Giuliani had said the recording would prove \u201cexculpatory\u201d and make clear that the conversation was the first time that Mr. Trump had heard about any deal with Ms. McDougal and American Media Inc., the publisher of The Enquirer. But on the recording, Mr. Trump appears to demonstrate familiarity with an agreement, saying nothing to suggest that he was only learning about it then.\nSome Republicans, including defenders of Mr. Cohen, have questioned Mr. Davis\u2019s intentions, sensing in his re-emergence a desire to exact vengeance on Mr. Trump for the Clintons. Though Mr. Davis served for only about a year in the White House, leaving just as the Monica Lewinsky scandal was breaking, he has long established himself as a reliable Clinton-friendly talking head, nearly five decades after meeting Mrs. Clinton at Yale Law School.\n\u201cPeople just write him off as, \u2018Oh, God, a Clinton hack,\u201d said Philippe Reines, a longtime aide to Mrs. Clinton. \u201cBut he doesn\u2019t say crazy stuff.\u201d\nIn an email to Mrs. Clinton in 2012, released as part of a trove of State Department communications, Mr. Davis shared with her a column he intended to publish paying homage to her tenure, her work ethic and her \u201cbright yellow pantsuit.\u201d He wrote a book this year arguing that James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, cost Mrs. Clinton the presidency.\n\u201cObviously, when Michael hired Lanny, it was a signal that Michael is looking to do what\u2019s best for Michael,\u201d said Sam Nunberg, a former colleague of Mr. Cohen\u2019s in Mr. Trump\u2019s orbit who served as a campaign adviser early in Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 run. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think Michael is being well served.\u201d\nHe cast doubt on the value of the recording\u2019s release, asking if Mr. Davis cared more about simply embarrassing Mr. Trump. \u201cIs he using Michael for his own purposes?\u201d Mr. Nunberg said. \u201cI\u2019m somebody who loves publicity stunts. I give that one a \u2018C.\u2019\u201d\nMr. Davis said his only loyalty was to his client, insisting this was \u201cnot a crusade against Trump.\u201d\n\u201cExpectations are way too high,\u201d he said. \u201cOne man isn\u2019t going to bring down Donald Trump.\u201d\nAnd yet, he hastened to add, something unusual had been happening this week: strangers recognizing him \u2014 Lanny Davis from television \u2014 asking him to keep on it.", "date": "July 25, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/25/us/politics/lanny-davis-michael-cohen-trump.html", "tags": "\u2018 \u201c lanny clinton representing cohen swinging davis michael \u2014 comes said classic"}
