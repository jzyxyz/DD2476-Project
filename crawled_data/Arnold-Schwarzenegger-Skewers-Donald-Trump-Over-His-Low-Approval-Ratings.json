Now you\u2019re in the 30s?\u201d\n\u201cBut what do you expect?\u201d Schwarzenegger added. \u201cI mean when you take away after-school programs for children and Meals on Wheels for the poor people, that\u2019s not what you call \u2018making America great again.\u2019 Come on!\u201d\nWatch the clip here:\nAfter rhetorically asking Trump who was advising him on his controversial policies, the Hollywood action star then appeared to extend an olive branch.\nHe invited the commander in chief to visit Hart Middle School in Washington D.C. to see the work his\u00a0After-School All-Stars\u00a0organization is carrying out.\n\u201cI\u2019ll take you there, so you can see the fantastic work that they\u2019re doing for these children,\u201d Schwarzenegger added.\nSchwarzenegger tagged Trump, with\u00a0whom he\u2019s repeatedly clashed over his hosting of the \u201cCelebrity Apprentice,\u201d in the post.
