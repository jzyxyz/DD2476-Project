{"title": "At the N.R.A., a Cash Machine Sputtering", "content": "The tantalizing leaks have spilled out in the weeks since the National Rifle Association\u2019s annual convention in Indianapolis devolved into civil war.\nAmid anxiety over falling revenue and mounting legal trouble has come news that the gun group\u2019s longtime chief executive, Wayne LaPierre, billed $275,000 for purchases at the Zegna luxury men\u2019s wear boutique in Beverly Hills. Its largely ceremonial president, Oliver L. North, had a contract worth millions of dollars a year. And a litany of payments benefited prominent officials, like the $60,000 for advertising on a TV show featuring the rock musician and N.R.A. board member Ted Nugent.\nBut behind the internecine squabbling lie deeper financial problems. A review of tax records by The New York Times shows that, to steady its finances, the powerful lobbying group has increasingly relied on cash infusions and other transactions involving its affiliated foundation \u2014 at least $206 million worth since 2010.\nThe role of the foundation is among the issues being examined in a new investigation into the N.R.A.\u2019s tax-exempt status by the New York attorney general, Letitia James. The N.R.A. and the charity received separate letters last month from Ms. James\u2019s office ordering them to preserve pertinent records, according to several people who had seen them.\nAt issue for investigators, tax experts say, would be whether that money was being used for charitable purposes, as required by law, and not to help finance the N.R.A.\u2019s political activities.\nThe N.R.A.\u2019s financial woes \u2014 what Mr. North called an \u201cexistential crisis\u201d \u2014 are at the root of the power struggle that has pitted Mr. LaPierre, the public face of the American gun-rights movement, against Mr. North, a right-wing celebrity since the Iran-contra scandal in the 1980s. Also enmeshed in the conflict is the N.R.A.\u2019s longtime and now estranged advertising firm, Ackerman McQueen.\nMany of the latest revelations came in a cache of internal documents posted online and spotted last week by a reporter for the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative website. In addition to his Beverly Hills wardrobe purchases, Mr. LaPierre, who earns more than $1.4 million a year, billed $267,000 in personal expenses, including flights and limousine service for trips to the Bahamas, Florida, Nevada, Budapest and an Italian lake resort, the leaked documents show. He even arranged for Ackerman to pay an intern\u2019s rent.\nAs for Mr. North, while the N.R.A\u2019s presidency is traditionally unpaid, he was agitating to change that \u2014 in spite of a lucrative perk, a contract with Ackerman that, according to Mr. LaPierre, paid him \u201cmillions of dollars annually.\u201d And Ackerman has been reaping $40 million a year, even though its signature product, the online streaming service NRATV, has minuscule web traffic.\nMany N.R.A. officials have said its woes are overstated. Opponents \u201care trying to paint this false narrative that we\u2019re in deep financial trouble, and I think it\u2019s wishful thinking on their part,\u201d Todd Rathner, a lobbyist and longtime N.R.A. board member, said in an interview.\nBut signs of stress are evident.\nMember dues fell to their lowest level in a half-decade in 2017, after President Trump\u2019s election. A legal battle in New York threatens a gun owners\u2019 insurance program that the N.R.A. had envisioned as a financial lifeline. And the group\u2019s $25 million line of credit, secured by the deed to its headquarters in the Washington suburbs, is nearly tapped out.\nAgainst that backdrop, the N.R.A. has found a variety of ways to draw money from its foundation, which over the years has provided financial support for a wide range of gun safety programs and special training programs for women, children and people with disabilities.\nOriginally, the N.R.A. promised to provide free office space and staff when it set up the foundation in 1991, but it now charges more than $6 million a year for that. Outright transfers from the foundation listed for charitable purposes have also risen fivefold since 2001, and exceed $100 million since 2012.\n\u201cIt tells me that the N.R.A. itself is in very poor financial health and they\u2019re being subsidized in large part by their foundation,\u201d said David Nelson, a former partner at Ernst & Young who has specialized in tax-exempt groups. \u201cThey\u2019re kind of running the organization into the ground.\u201d\nWhile both the N.R.A. and the foundation are tax-exempt, only donations to the foundation are tax-deductible, because the N.R.A. takes part in political activity.\n\u201cWe know that people can get their tax deductions by giving to the foundation, so you\u2019d rather give to that than the N.R.A., but the N.R.A. is the one spending all the money,\u201d Mr. Nelson added.\nN.R.A. officials said they had followed appropriate accounting rules, and that transfers reflected the foundation\u2019s evolution.\n\u201cAs the foundation has grown over the years, so has its use of N.R.A. office space, supplies and staff,\u201d Christie Majors, the foundation\u2019s finance director, said in a statement.\nRegarding Mr. LaPierre\u2019s spending, William A. Brewer III, a lawyer for the N.R.A., said in a statement that \u201cthere is no suggestion that any of Mr. LaPierre\u2019s expenses were improper in any way.\u201d As to why travel and wardrobe expenses were billed through a contractor, and not directly through the N.R.A. \u2014 an arrangement that may also interest investigators \u2014 Mr. Brewer said it was a practice \u201cabandoned some time ago\u201d that had been done \u201cfor confidentiality and security purposes.\u201d\nMr. Brewer\u2019s role has also been a flash point; he is the brother-in-law of Ackerman\u2019s chief executive, and the ad firm\u2019s allies saw a family feud as the backdrop when the N.R.A. recently sued Ackerman McQueen. Before Mr. North left the N.R.A., he called for an internal review of billings by Mr. Brewer\u2019s firm. In a recently leaked letter, Mr. North said that for the last year, the firm had been paid nearly $100,000 a day, \u201cdraining N.R.A. cash at mind-boggling speed.\u201d (An N.R.A. official said that characterization \u201creflects a misinformed view.\u201d)\nThe power struggle has yet to abate. On Tuesday, Allen B. West, a former congressman, became the first board member since the convention to call on Mr. LaPierre to resign. He accused the current leadership of \u201coutright lies\u201d and said board members had not been made aware of the controversial spending practices. \u201cIt is imperative that the N.R.A. cleans its own house,\u201d Mr. West said in a statement.\nIn response, Carolyn Meadows, the N.R.A.\u2019s new president, and two other senior officials said that board members had been apprised of the issues and had ample opportunity to delve into the details at the Indianapolis convention.\nWith the 2020 election looming, President Trump wants the N.R.A. to get back on track; he tweeted last month for the N.R.A. to \u201cstop the internal fighting, & get back to GREATNESS \u2014 FAST!\u201d\nDespite the president\u2019s ardent support for the N.R.A.\u2019s agenda, he has been part of the problem. The $128 million in dues the group reported in 2017 was the lowest since 2012; fund-raising often slips when Republicans take over the White House and N.R.A. members\u2019 worries recede.\n\u201cWe have an unusual business model,\u201d Mr. Rathner said. \u201cThe more successful we are, the less money we make, but clearly that doesn\u2019t stop us from doing the job our members expect us to do, and as history has proven, we find ways to make it back each election cycle.\u201d\nThe call came at 2:58 p.m. on a Wednesday in April.\nMr. North was on the phone. He had called a senior aide to Mr. LaPierre to convey a message. Mr. North, a retired marine lieutenant colonel and right-wing celebrity since the Iran-contra scandal in the 1980s, warned that if Mr. LaPierre didn\u2019t retire, a damaging letter would be delivered to the N.R.A. board.\nMr. LaPierre was taken aback.\n\u201cI was forced to confront one of those defining choices, styled, in the parlance of extortionists, as an offer I couldn\u2019t refuse,\u201d he wrote to the board. \u201cI refused it.\u201d\nThe feud played out swiftly, with Mr. LaPierre, a veteran inside operator, easily outmaneuvering Mr. North, who was ousted a few days later.\nBut Mr. North\u2019s threat effectively came to fruition in the recent leaks that documented not only Mr. LaPierre\u2019s wardrobe and assorted expenses, but also a menu of other N.R.A. perks.\nMarion Hammer, a longtime board member and lobbyist, received $270,000 in consulting fees from the gun group last year. The N.R.A. also paid David Keene, a former president, $40,000 last year, even as he was enmeshed in the scandal involving his one-time business partner Maria Butina, a Russian who pleaded guilty to being a covert foreign agent.\nAnd there was the nearly $14,000 Ackerman paid over three months, at Mr. LaPierre\u2019s request, to rent an apartment in Virginia for a young woman who was then a summer intern, and is now an N.R.A. employee.\n\u201cThe N.R.A. was introduced to this young lady by her father, who is a local first responder and longtime N.R.A. member,\u201d said Andrew Arulanandam, an N.R.A. spokesman, who added that the accommodation was made after housing at a nearby university, where interns typically stayed, became unavailable.\nMs. Meadows, the new president, called the revelations \u201cstale news \u2014 being recycled by those with personal agendas.\u201d\nSuch payments are likely to be scrutinized by Ms. James\u2019s office, which is examining \u201ctransactions between the N.R.A. and its board members, unauthorized political activity, and potentially false or misleading disclosures in regulatory filings,\u201d according to a copy of a letter sent to the N.R.A. and reviewed by The Times. (The attorney general of New York has jurisdiction because the N.R.A. was established there.)\nFederal rules restrict transactions that confer economic benefits on high-ranking employees of tax-exempt organizations. A number of such transactions have already drawn scrutiny, and others are emerging.\nThe N.R.A., for instance, has for several years held its World Shooting Championship at Peacemaker National Training Center in Glengary, W.V. The center, which received $70,500 last year for hosting the competition, is owned by Cole McCulloch, the N.R.A.\u2019s director of competitive shooting, according to a document among those recently leaked.\nMr. Arulanandam said Mr. McCulloch\u2019s ownership of the shooting range had been disclosed to the gun group\u2019s general counsel \u201cand approved by the N.R.A. Audit Committee.\u201d\nIt was Ms. James\u2019s threats to investigate the N.R.A.\u2019s tax-exempt status that led the N.R.A. to audit its contractors last summer, touching off the power struggle. N.R.A. officials have said Ackerman refused to turn over numerous financial documents. Ackerman has rebutted that, but some board members feared the N.R.A. was being overbilled.\nIt was a shocking standoff. The Oklahoma-based advertising firm has defined the modern N.R.A.\u2019s voice, going back to the \u201cI\u2019m the N.R.A.\u201d campaign in the 1980s. Ackerman\u2019s top executive in the Washington area, Tony Makris, is a former business associate of Mr. LaPierre\u2019s.\nBut Ackerman declined even to provide the N.R.A. with internal statistics on NRATV\u2019s viewership. A review of data from Comscore, which tracks web traffic, suggests why that might be: The NRATV site had just 49,000 unique visitors in January, and less traffic in March than Oklahoman.com, the website of Ackerman\u2019s hometown newspaper.\nThe most contested document was a contract Ackerman struck with Mr. North. When Mr. North became president of the gun rights group a year ago, he left Fox News, and wanted to keep getting paid. But N.R.A. presidents, including celebrities like Charlton Heston, have served without pay. Last month, Mr. North wrote to two prominent N.R.A. officials to complain that because of the group\u2019s \u201cdifficult financial situation, I am spending much more time on the road raising money\u201d than expected.\nSenior N.R.A. executives are well compensated; eight of them make more than the head of the American Red Cross, a tax-exempt organization with 10 times the revenue of the N.R.A. Mr. LaPierre\u2019s total pay spiked in 2015 to more than $5 million because of an early retirement payout.\nMr. North did, in effect, turn the presidency into a paid position by signing a deal with Ackerman to host an NRATV web series called \u201cAmerican Heroes,\u201d though Mr. LaPierre told the board that Mr. North appeared in only three of the dozen expected episodes.\nN.R.A. officials have said Mr. North was not supposed to work directly for the group\u2019s contractor, because of the potential for conflicts of interest.\nMr. North has rebutted that.\n\u201cWayne knew about my contract since its inception,\u201d he wrote in his letter to the two N.R.A. officials. \u201cWayne helped negotiate the contract.\u201d\nSome members believe the group has been woefully managed. In a recent open letter, Steve Hoback, a former N.R.A. official in its training department, warned that the organization had \u201cbecome the swamp that many have lashed out against in our Federal government.\u201d\nAnother former staff member, Andrew Lander, wrote in his own open letter that \u201cthe things that are taking place within the organization, I feel are things that corrupt Congressmen would be doing\u201d \u2014 not, he said, the leaders of the \u201coldest civil rights organization in the country.\u201d\nThe extent of the group\u2019s financial problems has in some ways been masked by the foundation, which is sitting on more than $29 million that is counted as an asset on the N.R.A.\u2019s books. Without it, the N.R.A. would have a negative net worth. The gun group said the money was largely an endowment set up for the N.R.A., but also encompassed reimbursements to the N.R.A. \u2014 for staff, supplies and rent \u2014 that had not yet been transferred.\nMarcus Owens, a partner at Loeb & Loeb who served for a decade as director of the exempt organizations division of the Internal Revenue Service, said the sums moving to the N.R.A. from the foundation were \u201csubstantial related-party transactions,\u201d and that \u201cin normal times, they would attract regulatory attention from the I.R.S. and a state attorney general.\u201d\nOpponents see opportunity.\n\u201cEach day, there\u2019s a new drip, drip, drip,\u201d said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control group. \u201cThe N.R.A. is not a gun advocacy organization but a business that has been engaged in self-dealing, awarding contracts with little accountability to their friends, and it seems like a business run amok. It\u2019s questionable whether they can play in 2020 the way they have in the past.\u201d\nSuch groups showed unusual financial strength in the recent midterm elections. Take Nevada. For years, there had been a push to close loopholes in background checks related to private gun sales, culminating in a successful 2016 ballot initiative. Adam Laxalt, then the state\u2019s Republican attorney general, appeared in a commercial opposing the measure, and was criticized when he later helped block it from going into effect.\nWhen Mr. Laxalt ran for governor last year, he had the N.R.A.\u2019s endorsement and A+ rating, and was fiercely opposed by gun control groups. He lost to Steve Sisolak, a Democrat who in February signed background check legislation into law.\n\u201cThat is Exhibit 1 of their diminishing power, and their inability to do what they used to do,\u201d Mr. Feinblatt said.\nMr. Rathner, the lobbyist and longtime N.R.A. board member, sees it differently. The organization\u2019s members, he said, pay their dues \u201cto protect them from anti-gun legislation and anti-gun policies, and quite frankly, we gave them a president who appointed two good Supreme Court justices and over 100 lower court judges to protect them for a generation or two. And we did that because that\u2019s what our members expect us to do.\u201d", "date": "May 14, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/us/nra-finances-executives-board-members.html", "tags": "\u201c ackerman n.r.a n.r.a. lapierre machine cash sputtering north foundation said"}
