{"title": "Virginia Adopts Medicaid Expansion, Promising Health Coverage To Almost 400,000", "content": "Medicaid expansion is coming to Virginia after the state\u2019s legislature approved a bill\u00a0Wednesday\u00a0that would provide health coverage to as many as 400,000 low-income residents of the Old Dominion.\nThe majority-GOP\u00a0General Assembly passed the measure with the votes of all Democratic legislators along with a minority of Republican lawmakers,\u00a0bringing to a close the six-year debate\u00a0over whether Virginia should accept funding from the Affordable Care Act\u00a0to expand Medicaid.\u00a0Gov.\u00a0Ralph Northam\u00a0(D), who campaigned in favor of Medicaid expansion last year, will sign the legislation.\n\u201cThis budget is the culmination of five years of effort to bring our taxpayer dollars home from Washington and expand Medicaid. As a doctor, I\u2019m so proud of the significant step we\u2019ve taken together to help Virginians get quality, affordable care,\u201d Northam said in a news release.\u00a0\nOnce the bill becomes law, Virginia will join 32 states and the District of Columbia\u00a0in expanding Medicaid. Almost 400,000 Virginians may qualify for health coverage as a result, according to the state\u2019s Department of Medical Assistance Services.\u00a0Benefits will become available at the beginning of next year, Northam\u00a0told WTOP-FM\u00a0Wednesday.\nThe Affordable Care Act calls for the program\u2019s benefits to be available to anyone earning up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, or about $16,000 for a single person. Under the law, the federal government provides at least 90 percent of the funding for the expansion. \nThe Virginia legislation covers the state\u2019s share of the expenses via an assessment on hospitals. The bill also reduces state spending on other programs that provide health care to uninsured people.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a historic day. Senate Democrats have been fighting for Medicaid expansion for years,\u201d state Senate Minority Leader Richard Saslaw (D) said at\u00a0a news conference\u00a0following Senate passage of the legislation\u00a0Wednesday.\nAs written, the Affordable Care Act would have expanded Medicaid nationwide in 2014. But the Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that states could refuse to enact it. To date, 18 states \u2015 including Virginia \u2015 had not implemented the policy, leaving 4.5 million people uninsured, according to an analysis published by the Urban Institute this month.\nThree other states may join Virginia by accepting Medicaid expansion this year. Activists in Idaho and Utah gathered enough signatures from residents to place the question on the ballot for voters to decide this November, and a campaign to do the same in Nebraska is underway. Maine voters approved a similar measure last November, but Gov. Paul LePage (R) has thus far refused to implement it.\nVirginia legislators had been at an impasse over the Medicaid expansion since the Supreme Court ruling. Former Gov. Robert McDonnell (R) opposed it, while former Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) supported it but was unable to persuade lawmakers to go along.\nThe political dynamics changed when Democrats made significant gains in last year\u2019s House of Delegates elections. Although Republicans retain majorities in both chambers of the General Assembly, the election results left them with just a one-vote margin in the House, the same they had in the Senate.\n\u201cElections matter. Elections have consequences,\u201d Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax (D) said at the Senate news conference. The entire Virginia House of Delegates and state Senate are up for election in 2019.\nAlthough Democrats are poised to succeed in their quest to expand health coverage through Medicaid in Virginia, there is a notable trade-off. The Medicaid expansion legislation also imposes work requirements on some enrollees, which is likely to result in fewer people gaining and keeping Medicaid benefits. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration announced this year that it would permit work requirements for the program for the first time in history.\nThis article has been updated to reflect the Virginia House of Delegates vote in favor of Medicaid expansion and to include comment from Virginia Democrats.", "date": "\n05/30/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/virginia-senate-medicaid-expansion-promising-health-coverage-to-almost-400000_n_5b0d94dde4b0802d69cef7ce", "tags": "adopts gov coverage medicaid virginia senate promising almost state expansion year affordable care health"}
