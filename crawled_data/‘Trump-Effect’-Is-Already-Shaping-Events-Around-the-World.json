{"title": "\u2018Trump Effect\u2019 Is Already Shaping Events Around the World", "content": "JERUSALEM \u2014 Within days of Donald J. Trump\u2019s election to the presidency, Jerusalem\u2019s city planning chief declared an end to the era of holding up new housing for Jewish residents in contentious neighborhoods out of deference to American objections.\nLast week, he followed through, advancing a long-delayed plan to build 500 homes, a down payment on thousands more to come. The mayor\u2019s office insisted that the timing was coincidental and the decision not political. But the planning chief made clear that he saw a green light to proceed \u201cnow that Trump\u201d had won.\nCall it the Trump Effect. Around the world, his election is already shaping events \u2014 or at least perceived to be shaping them \u2014 even though he will not take office for seven more weeks. Companies hoping to profit from Mr. Trump\u2019s economic policies have seen shares soar. Countries fearing his anti-trade stance have seen the value of their currencies plunge against the dollar. Governments are recalibrating policies on trade, defense and immigration.\nThe behavior of the global markets toward Mr. Trump has been uneven. On Monday, stocks and the dollar slipped slightly and bond prices rose, perhaps indicating a bit of caution after the postelection stock market surge.\nMuch of the markets\u2019 mixed reaction reflects uncertainty about a new president who has never held public office, leaving political leaders, business executives and international institutions to make bets on how a Trump administration may rewrite rules that have governed global affairs under American presidents of both parties.\n\u201cFor allies and adversaries alike, the election of Donald Trump represents the likely abandonment of a decades-old U.S. commitment to uphold the global order,\u201d said Ivo Daalder, a former United States ambassador to NATO who is now president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.\nFor some, there was initially a promising forecast. American and foreign stock markets climbed in what some analysts called \u201cthe Trump bump.\u201d The Dow Jones industrial average has broken several records since the election, and last week topped 19,000 for the first time amid expectations of more business-friendly regulatory policies. Investment banks like Goldman Sachs have fared particularly well.\nEuropean firms have seen stock prices rise, too. Deutsche Bank, whose shares shot up as high as 17 percent after the election, has reasons for optimism beyond its longtime ties to Mr. Trump\u2019s businesses. With the Justice Department proposing a $14 billion fine as it begins negotiations with the bank over its handling of mortgage-backed securities in the 2008 financial crisis, some in Germany hope a new administration will ease up and loosen regulations.\nAnother company that has seen its share value increase since the election is Magal Security Systems, an Israeli firm that helped develop high-tech security barriers around Gaza and the West Bank. With Mr. Trump\u2019s promise to build a wall along the border with Mexico, investors expect that firms like Magal could get some of the business. Magal\u2019s shares rose as high as 24 percent above their pre-election level, with trading volume as much as 150 times higher.\nFor the same reason, Mexico has taken an economic hit since the election. Besides the wall, Mr. Trump has vowed to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mexico\u2019s peso has fallen sharply, and its central bank last week slashed its growth projection for next year, citing \u201cthe electoral process in the United States.\u201d\nOther economies have reacted with trepidation amid fears that Mr. Trump\u2019s policies may drive up interest rates and inflation, an expectation that some traders call Trumpflation.\nSome countries are trying to figure out how to respond in other ways. Leaders of NATO allies are looking at increasing military spending in response to Mr. Trump\u2019s insistence that they pay a greater share of their defense. Lithuania last week chose a new prime minister, who renewed the nation\u2019s promise to raise security spending.\nIn the Philippines, where President Rodrigo Duterte has feuded with President Obama, the government has tried to gain favor in Mr. Trump\u2019s Washington. Mr. Duterte named as his new trade envoy to the United States Jose E. B. Antonio, a real estate tycoon who is helping build Trump Tower Manila. After Britain rebuffed Mr. Trump\u2019s suggestion to name Nigel Farage, a leader of the \u201cBrexit\u201d campaign to leave the European Union, as ambassador to the United States, The Times of London reported that Mr. Farage may move to America anyway.\nIn many places, there is still much head scratching over Mr. Trump. The mass-circulation Bild Zeitung in Germany secured exclusive rights to translating into German the whole interview Mr. Trump gave to The New York Times last week. Bungeishunju, the Japanese publisher of \u201cTrump Revealed,\u201d by the Washington Post journalists Michael Kranish and Marc Fisher, reprinted an additional 10,000 copies.\nIn China, initial optimism about Mr. Trump is giving way to skepticism. \u201cWe should stop imagining what benefits Trump\u2019s election could bring to China,\u201d Zhu Chenghu, a retired major general, said at a seminar at the China Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing on Friday. \u201cHe will return to the traditional policies that rely on the role of the U.S. dollar and seek expansion overseas.\u201d\nMr. Trump\u2019s election is getting credit, or blame, for all sorts of events, no matter how tangential. In Russia, a newspaper interviewed an analyst who suggested that the arrest of a cabinet minister on bribery charges may have resulted from Mr. Trump\u2019s success because Moscow no longer had to fear going after prot\u00e9g\u00e9s of reformers who were once close to Washington.\nNowhere has the Trump Effect been more visible than in Jerusalem, where the political right has openly rejoiced at the election. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has had a prickly relationship with Mr. Obama, has made clear to associates that he is overjoyed at Mr. Trump\u2019s ascension.\nMembers of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s coalition expect Mr. Trump to abandon the practice of Mr. Obama and presidents of both parties who tried to restrain Israel from building housing in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Shortly after the election, a Trump adviser said settlements were not an obstacle to peace, appearing to have adopted the argument Mr. Netanyahu makes.\n\u201cThe next few weeks present a unique window of opportunity for Israel,\u201d Naftali Bennett, who leads a pro-settler party in Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s cabinet, told a conference sponsored by The Jerusalem Post last week. After years of American pressure, he added, \u201cit\u2019s ours to decide.\u201d\nBetty Herschman, the director of international relations for Ir Amim, a group that opposes settlement construction, said it was too early to know what Mr. Trump\u2019s policy would actually be. But she said one thing was clear: \u201cThe Israeli right is already celebrating.\u201d\nA case in point was last week\u2019s decision on 500 new housing units in Ramat Shlomo, an ultra-Orthodox neighborhood of annexed East Jerusalem across the \u201cgreen line\u201d delineating the border that existed until Israel won the 1967 war. The development had been in the works for years without being built. An announcement that it would proceed in 2010 while Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was visiting Israel infuriated Mr. Obama and his team.\nBrachie Sprung, a spokeswoman for Mayor Nir Barkat, said last week\u2019s action by the municipal planning committee was a result of the developer\u2019s coming back to the city with revisions to his plan that required new approval.\n\u201cThere has been no political statement here with this piece of land,\u201d she said.\nBut it was easy to see the move in the context of the emerging Trump era. Meir Turgeman, the deputy mayor who leads the planning committee, had just days earlier promised to advance 7,000 housing units that were delayed under American pressure, and he named Ramat Shlomo as an example.\n\u201cI intend to exploit the change of the guard in the U.S.A. and bring them to approval,\u201d Mr. Turgeman told Israel\u2019s Channel 2. Until now, he said, there had been pressure from Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s office not to proceed to avoid angering Washington. \u201cThat\u2019s over. From now, we intend to take the plans out of deep freeze.\u201d", "date": "Nov. 28, 2016", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/28/world/middleeast/trump-effect-is-already-shaping-events-around-the-world.html", "tags": "around \u2018 world mr. already election week \u201d trump effect events shaping last jerusalem new"}
