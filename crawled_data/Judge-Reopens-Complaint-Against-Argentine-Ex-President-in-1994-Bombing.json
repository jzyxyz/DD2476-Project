{"title": "Judge Reopens Complaint Against Argentine Ex-President in 1994 Bombing", "content": "BUENOS AIRES \u2014 A federal judge in Argentina has ordered the reopening of a criminal complaint against former President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner in which she had been accused of conspiring to derail an investigation into the bombing of a Jewish center here in 1994 in which 85 people were killed.\nThe judge, Claudio Bonadio, is reviving a complaint brought by Alberto Nisman, a federal prosecutor who died last year in mysterious circumstances, as he proceeds with a related inquiry into one of Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s political allies.\nJudge Bonadio made the decision on Friday, but it was not made public until Monday. According to a copy of his filing, he told a colleague, Judge Daniel Rafecas, to send him Mr. Nisman\u2019s 289-page complaint so he could investigate accusations against H\u00e9ctor Timerman, a former foreign minister under Mrs. Kirchner.\nJudge Rafecas originally oversaw Mr. Nisman\u2019s complaint, and has emphatically dismissed it three times, most recently last week.\nJudge Bonadio\u2019s decision to annex Mr. Nisman\u2019s complaint to his investigation comes after lawyers for the fathers of two women killed in the attack on the Jewish center filed a request last week to reopen it.\nIn the complaint, Mr. Nisman had accused Mrs. Kirchner and Mr. Timerman of ordering secret negotiations to shield former Iranian officials thought to be behind the attack in exchange for favorable trade agreements.\nMr. Nisman was found dead in his Buenos Aires apartment in January 2015, his body slumped in a pool of blood. He had a gunshot wound in the head, and a pistol he had borrowed from an assistant was found beneath his body.\nJudge Bonadio has previously requested access to Mr. Nisman\u2019s complaint, though in that instance it was only for reference. This time, however, he is seeking to investigate its claims. He asked for all of the recordings involving Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s political supporters on which Mr. Nisman had based his case.\nAlejandro R\u00faa, Mr. Timerman\u2019s lawyer, and other critics have accused supporters of Mr. Nisman of \u201cforum shopping,\u201d or looking for a favorable judge.\nMr. R\u00faa asked Judge Bonadio on Monday to recuse himself, contending that it would be inappropriate for the judge to investigate Mr. Nisman\u2019s accusations because a decade ago concerns over his impartiality led to his removal from a different case related to the bombing.\nMrs. Kirchner \u2014 who has called Mr. Nisman\u2019s original criminal complaint \u201cabsurd\u201d \u2014 has criticized Judge Bonadio in recent months, questioning his impartiality in other cases in which she is involved.\nJust last week, Judge Rafecas rejected an attempt by a Jewish organization, known by its acronym, DAIA, to resuscitate Mr. Nisman\u2019s complaint.\nAmong other things, Judge Rafecas reiterated his ruling that a tenet of Mr. Nisman\u2019s complaint \u2014 that Mr. Timerman had lobbied to lift Interpol arrest warrants against the Iranian suspects \u2014 had been disproved.\nThe two victims\u2019 fathers were able to persuade Judge Bonadio to reopen the complaint by construing new related evidence against Mr. Timerman as a treason case, said Tom\u00e1s J. Farini Duggan, a lawyer for the fathers.", "date": "Aug. 8, 2016", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/09/world/americas/argentina-cristina-fernandez-de-kirchner-1994-bombing.html", "tags": "reopens bonadio kirchner judge timerman nisman last ex-president complaint \u2014 mrs. argentine bombing"}
