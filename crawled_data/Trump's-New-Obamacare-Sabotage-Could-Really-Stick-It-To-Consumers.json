{"title": "Trump's New Obamacare Sabotage Could Really Stick It To Consumers", "content": "BOSTON \u2015\u00a0The Trump administration\u2019s new attack on Obamacare will expose consumers to surprise, sometimes staggering medical bills.\nJust ask some of the state officials who deal with these kinds of issues every day.\nThey are part of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, which happened to be meeting in Boston this weekend, days after the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) finalized new rules for \u201cshort-term, limited-duration\u201d insurance policies.\nThese plans, which insurers have sold for decades, are supposed to provide minimal, temporary assistance for people with brief gaps in coverage. For that reason, they are not subject to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s regulations. Short-term policies do not have to cover mental health care, prescriptions, or other services that the 2010 health care law calls essential. And insurers don\u2019t have to sell these policies to people who have pre-existing medical conditions.\nThe Affordable Care Act didn\u2019t legislate short-term plans out of existence, but it allowed the federal government to regulate them aggressively. The Obama administration did just that, issuing rules that limited the plans to durations of no more than three months.\nObama officials also decided that short-term plans wouldn\u2019t count toward the individual mandate, meaning that people who bought those plans would owe a financial penalty for not having comprehensive coverage.\nNow the Trump administration has undone all of that. \nUnder the new rules that HHS released last week, insurers can go back to selling short-term plans that last for (nearly) one year and, in a new twist, they\u2019ll be able to let consumers renew those plans twice. If insurers decide to offer such policies, consumers could then hold \u201cshort term\u201d coverage for what basically works out to three years. They wouldn\u2019t even have to worry about the individual mandate, because, thanks to the GOP tax bill that Trump signed late last year, the penalty falls to zero in 2019.\nAll of this is likely to make short-term coverage an attractive option for people healthy enough to qualify for it. Because the policies don\u2019t pay for many expensive services and because the policies aren\u2019t available to the people most likely to run up large bills, the premiums are a lot lower than the premiums for comprehensive coverage \u2015 a fact that the Trump administration highlighted this week as it touted the new regulations.\n\u201cWhat we are doing is bringing cheap and more affordable options to individuals who are trapped under the Affordable Care Act with insurance that is actually not affordable or not available or doesn\u2019t deliver them hospitals and doctors that they need,\u201d HHS Secretary Alex Azar said\u00a0during a Fox Business Network appearance last week.\nBut state insurance officials like\u00a0Jessica Altman, who is insurance commissioner in Pennsylvania, say the administration isn\u2019t telling the public or would-be buyers the whole story about what the policies will cover \u2015 and, more importantly, what they will not cover.\n\u201cI\u2019m frustrated with how [administration officials] are presenting this,\u201d Altman said in an interview. \u201cThey\u2019re saying, \u2018Here\u2019s this option that\u2019s affordable and wonderful,\u2019 and not talking about how limited the plans are.\u201d\nAltman wasn\u2019t the only regulator in Boston wary of the change. Lori Wing-Heier, who directs Alaska\u2019s insurance division, said she thinks short-term plans can play a useful, if limited, role in the market. But with the new regulation, she told HuffPost, \u201cI\u2019m concerned that people will buy these policies, show up at the hospital for a condition they did not expect, and discover they are not covered.\u201d\nUnder the Trump administration\u2019s regulations, the marketing material for short-term plans must contain clear, prominent language informing consumers that the policies are not equivalent to the more comprehensive plans that comply with Affordable Care Act standards. In theory, that should give consumers the information they need to make an informed choice \u2015 a point that administration officials have made repeatedly as their proposal has come under attack.\u00a0\n\u201cOne of the things we are doing is requiring consumer protection notice on the plans,\u201d Azar told reporters during a briefing on Wednesday. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s a more robust notice than President Obama\u2019s administration had on these very same plans to ensure the patient, the consumer, knows going in what they are getting and what they\u2019re not getting through the plan.\u201d\nBut even attentive consumers might not grasp the implications of what that language means, according to the insurance regulators. And these officials should know, because they are the ones who monitor marketing materials and hear from consumers when they get bills they didn\u2019t expect.\u00a0\n\u201cThey may read [the warning], but that\u2019s not the same as understanding it,\u201d Michael Conway, Colorado\u2019s interim commissioner, warned, noting that many people will assume these plans are still subject to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s rules. \u201cBecause of the ACA, now people think the baseline has changed \u2015 that certain things are always covered.\u201d\nAnd it\u2019s not just a question of understanding the limits on what short-term plans cover. It\u2019s also a question of matching up those limits to the likely costs of an intensive medical episode \u2015 something that even experts can find difficult.\nAltman, from Pennsylvania, frequently \ufeffcites a story about a woman who bought a short-term plan, had a stroke, and discovered belatedly that her $250,000 in hospital bills far exceed the $40,000 cap from her policy.\u00a0\n\u201cYou can look at one of these plans and you\u2019ll see it covers doctors, hospitals, maybe even drugs, and so you think it will have everything I need,\u201d Altman said. \u201cYou won\u2019t realize that the amounts are caps, or have exclusions \u2015 it\u2019s really difficult to expect that consumers will be able to figure out what all of this means, and really know what they are getting.\u201d\nYet another hazard for buyers is the ambiguity over pre-existing conditions. When insurers see a big claim, they will frequently scour medical records for evidence of pre-existing conditions, sometimes denying payment for people who thought they had applied for coverage \u2015 and given their histories \u2015 in good faith.\nWing-Heier, from Alaska, says she has seen this happen before. \u201cYou fill out the form, the medical forms, you think you are being honest about your history, and then the insurers go through your records and find something that you didn\u2019t think was an issue, your doctor didn\u2019t think was an issue, but now the insurer is saying it\u2019s a pre-existing condition.\u201d\nInsurance commissioners aren\u2019t just worried about surprise bills for people who get short-term plans. They also worry about insurance markets becoming less stable. One possibility is that insurers will develop new policies that look more like Affordable Care Act \u2015 just enough to attract people who want comprehensive coverage \u2015 while still leaving out key benefits and selling only to people in good health.\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019ll see some plans that are only one or two degrees different from an ACA plan, though it\u2019ll still be underwritten, so a lot cheaper \u2015 and not available to people with pre-existing conditions,\u201d said Joel Ario, a former commissioner from Pennsylvania and Oregon who is now a managing director at Manatt Health.\u00a0\u201cIt really opens a pandora\u2019s box.\u201d\nAnd the more creative the plans get, the bigger the challenge for regulators will be. Many of the companies selling these plans aren\u2019t the big, commercial insurers. They are smaller operations more likely to have shaky financial reserves or engage in deceptive marketing, as a recent Commonwealth Fund briefing paper noted. Plus these insurers sell plans through agents and brokers who might not always make sure consumers understand what they are buying.\u00a0\nTo be clear, the present and former commissioners expressing these concerns don\u2019t speak for all of their counterparts.\nOpinions of the new regulation mostly break down along predictable philosophical and party lines: More liberal or Democratic-affiliated commissioners tend to be critical of the new regulation, while more conservative and Republican-affiliated ones tend to support it.\nShort-term plans may not offer full financial protection, the latter say, but the policies are better than nothing \u2015 and nothing is what many consumers have now.\nThat last part is certainly true. The Affordable Care Act\u2019s new rules for insurers made insurance a lot more expensive. And although the law also\u00a0created a system of tax credits to offset those higher prices, people with incomes higher than four times the poverty line \u2015 about $49,000 for an individual, $100,000 for a family of four \u2015 don\u2019t receive those subsidies. \nThey have to pay full price and, in some instances, coverage comes to more than 20 percent of their household incomes. And that\u2019s before taking into account out-of-pocket expenses. \nThe high premiums are the result of multiple causes, some related to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s design and some related to the way hostile GOP officials have treated it. But whatever the causes, it\u2019s left some middle- to upper-middle income people struggling to find decent insurance. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to have it for people who can\u2019t afford coverage now \u2015 it covers people up to what they can afford,\u201d Jim Ridling, commissioner in Alabama said.\nThe numbers bear this out. The number of people buying insurance on their own, rather than through employers, has started to fall, as a recent report from the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation confirmed.\u00a0The decline is mostly among people who face those high premiums because they don\u2019t qualify for subsidies.\u00a0\nBut there are other ways to help struggling consumers. At the state level, officials can tap into federal funds \u2015 with a relatively modest state investment \u2015 in order to create create so-called reinsurance pools, which reduce premiums by offsetting the cost of expensive beneficiaries. \u00a0\nAt the federal level, lawmakers could make tax credits more generous \u2015 or take more comprehensive action, like having government set prices to control costs or provide insurance directly through some kind of public plan. A single-payer or \u201cMedicare for all\u201d plan, which many Democrats support, would do both of these things.\nThe catch is that these steps would entail new taxes, new regulations, or both \u2015 steps that the Trump administration and its allies oppose. That is why officials have settled, instead, on a strategy of letting insurers offer policies that simply don\u2019t provide the same level of protection \u2015 and aren\u2019t as widely available \u2015 as comprehensive coverage.\n\u201cOf course they\u2019ll be less expensive,\u201d California Commissioner Dave Jones said. \u201cThat\u2019s because it\u2019s junk insurance and it won\u2019t cover the same things.\u201d\nThis story has been updated to clarify which officials support the new regulations.", "date": "\n08/05/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-short-term-junk-insurance-naic_n_5b662e57e4b0fd5c73da5ab0", "tags": "really obamacare short-term \u201d trump \u2015 insurance stick policies could plans new sabotage consumers"}
