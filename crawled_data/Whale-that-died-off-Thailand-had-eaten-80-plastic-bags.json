They nursed the whale through the week but it died on Friday afternoon.\nMarine biologist Thon Thamrongnawasawat told Agence France-Presse the bags would have made it impossible for the whale to eat nutritional food.\n\"If you have 80 plastic bags in your stomach, you die,\" he said.", "date": "2 June 2018", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-44344468", "tags": "made officials pilot eaten canal marine died plastic thailand bags whale"}
