{"title": "House Votes To Condemn White Supremacy, And Thus Rep- Steve King", "content": "The House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted on Tuesday to formally condemn white supremacy and white nationalism, in reference to the racist remarks by Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa).\u00a0\nHouse Resolution 41, introduced by Majority Whip James Clyburn (D-S.C.) to \u201creject white nationalism and white supremacy,\u201d comes as King faces bipartisan backlash for his statements in a recent interview with The New York Times. In it, King asked how the terms \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d and \u201cwhite nationalist\u201d became \u201coffensive.\u201d\nThe GOP was initially criticized for delaying its own condemnation of King, whom\u00a0HuffPost has long described as an open white supremacist for similar racist comments over the years. But Republicans moved to punish him this week by stripping him of committee assignments\u00a0in the current Congress.\nTuesday\u2019s resolution, which passed by a vote of 424-1, was seen as a precursor to censuring King. The House has two measures pending on censure, the highest form of disapproval the chamber can levy before full expulsion. Censure is a formal vote of disapproval of a member by a House majority, according to Roll Call.\nThe only lawmaker to vote against the white supremacy measure was Rep. Bobby Rush (D-Ill.), who wanted a much more direct rebuke of King.\nFor his part, King said he\u2019d vote yes on Resolution 41, in an apparent attempt to separate his name from it.\n\u201cI want to ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, let\u2019s vote for this resolution,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m putting up a yes on the board here because what you say here is right and is true and is just, and so is what I have stated here on the floor of the House.\u201d\nKing also noted: \u201cI regret we are in this place.\u201d\u00a0\nRead the resolution below:", "date": "\n01/15/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/house-condemn-white-supremacy-steve-king_n_5c3e344ee4b0e0baf541cabf", "tags": "resolution supremacy steve condemn king white house \u201d nationalism votes rep- thus tuesday vote"}
