{"title": "Mueller Will Accept Some Written Answers From Trump", "content": "The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, eased up slightly on his demands to question President Trump in the Russia investigation, a shift that came as the president\u2019s lawyers, who have advised him against sitting for an interview, are fighting his desire to answer investigators\u2019 queries.\nMr. Mueller will accept written answers from Mr. Trump on questions about whether his campaign conspired with Russia\u2019s election interference, Mr. Mueller\u2019s office told the president\u2019s lawyers in a letter, two people briefed on it said on Tuesday.\nOn another significant aspect of the investigation \u2014 whether the president tried to obstruct the inquiry itself \u2014 Mr. Mueller and his investigators understood that issues of executive privilege could complicate their pursuit of a presidential interview and did not ask for written responses on that matter, according to the letter, which was sent on Friday.\nMr. Mueller did not say that he was giving up on an interview altogether, including on questions of obstruction of justice. But the tone of the letter and the fact that the special counsel did not ask for written responses on obstruction prompted some Trump allies to conclude that if an interview takes place, its scope will be more limited than Mr. Trump\u2019s legal team initially believed, the people said.\nThe letter was the latest in lengthy negotiations between the two sides about whether Mr. Trump will be interviewed by investigators. \u201cWe continue to maintain an ongoing dialogue with the office of the special counsel,\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyer Jay Sekulow said, adding that it was the legal team\u2019s policy not to discuss its communications with the special counsel\u2019s office. A spokesman for the special counsel declined to comment.\nMr. Trump\u2019s lawyers have tried to put off a formal interview; they have repeatedly said that to determine whether the Trump campaign conspired with Russia\u2019s election interference and whether Mr. Trump tried to obstruct the inquiry, Mr. Mueller can find the answers in the interviews that his investigators have conducted with witnesses, including senior White House aides and administration officials, and more than 1.4 million documents turned over by the White House.\nContrary to his lawyer\u2019s efforts, Mr. Trump has continued to insist to them and to aides that he wants to be questioned by Mr. Mueller. The president believes that he has done nothing wrong and that he can prove that and bring an end to the investigation.\nMr. Trump\u2019s lawyers have dangled written answers as a possibility, and Mr. Mueller\u2019s team appeared receptive to it as an interim measure.\nThe offer from Mr. Mueller came as new details emerged about how the president\u2019s legal team has handled the interview negotiations. In his new book \u201cFear,\u201d the reporter Bob Woodward described a March meeting between John M. Dowd, then the head of Mr. Trump\u2019s legal team, and Mr. Mueller and his deputies.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to sit there and let him look like an idiot,\u201d Mr. Dowd told Mr. Mueller, according to the book, due out next week; The New York Times obtained a copy. \u201cAnd you publish that transcript, because everything leaks in Washington, and the guys overseas are going to say, \u2018I told you he was an idiot. I told you he was a goddamn dumbbell. What are we dealing with this idiot for?\u2019\u201d\nThe book said that Mr. Mueller told Mr. Dowd: \u201cJohn, I understand.\u201d\nIn the same meeting, Mr. Mueller and Mr. Dowd began arguing intensely, and Mr. Mueller threatened to subpoena the president.\nMr. Dowd told the president that if he sat for an interview, he would probably be charged with perjury and end up in an \u201corange jumpsuit,\u201d according to Mr. Woodward.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be a real good witness,\u201d the president told Mr. Dowd, the book said.\n\u201cYou are not a good witness,\u201d Mr. Dowd told the president. \u201cMr. President, I\u2019m afraid I just can\u2019t help you.\u201d\nMr. Dowd resigned from the team shortly after because he said he could not represent the president if he wanted to do the interview.\nMr. Dowd denied the account.\n\u201cI have not read Bob Woodward\u2019s book, which appears to be the most recent in an endless cycle of accusations and misrepresentations based on anonymous statements from unknown malcontents,\u201d Mr. Dowd said in a statement in which he specifically denied the jumpsuit comment.\n\u201cIt was a great honor and distinct privilege to serve President Trump,\u201d Mr. Dowd said.\nMr. Woodward said he stood by his reporting.", "date": "Sept. 4, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/04/us/politics/mueller-trump-russia-investigation.html", "tags": "accept dowd written \u201d trump interview answers told mueller"}
