{"title": "Ann Liv Young on Elektra, a \u2018More Primitive Version of Myself\u2019", "content": "The provocative choreographer and performance artist Ann Liv Young loves a good revenge tale. In \u201cElektra,\u201d her latest dance-and-song adventure, which has its United States premiere at New York Live Arts on Wednesday, she mines Greek drama to retell the tale of Sophocles\u2019 Elektra. Her brazen approach to performance, which mixes text, pop songs and vigorous movement, is rarely gentle. \u201cI need to feel like I\u2019m being heard, and I need to know that you\u2019re with me,\u201d she said. \u201cHow can I wake you up without looking you in the eyes or touching you?\u201d\nIt\u2019s probably best not to get too literal about her adherence to the plot, in which Elektra \u2014 she plays the role herself \u2014 and Orestes, her brother, seek revenge on their mother, Klytemnestra for the murder of their father. Ms. Young\u2019s rendition focuses on Chrysothemis, Elektra\u2019s sister, and takes place in a sand pit surrounded by a fence \u2014 so the pig can\u2019t escape. (Yes, there is a real pig.) \u201cElektra,\u201d which runs through Jan. 30, will be followed by a 15-minute intermission \u2014 it\u2019s really a performance \u2014then finally by the cabaret version of the show, which includes performances by Lovey, Ms. Young\u2019s 8-year-old daughter. Think of it as three shows in one.\nLovey, incidentally, will present the premiere of her first performance piece, \u201cUnicorn,\u201d in Switzerland next month. \u201cShe\u2019s, like, slammed,\u201d Ms. Young said. \u201cI tried to tell her that it was too much, but she\u2019s one of those.\u201d\nAnd in that way not unlike her mother. Ms. Young, who was born on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, has made a name for herself \u2014 especially in Europe, where she frequently tours \u2014 as one of the most daring artists of her generation. She is currently shooting a reality show that the media company Noise Production is planning to pitch to networks in March. In it, she will star as Sherry, her advice-giving alter ego. But for this stint as Elektra, she won\u2019t be breaking the fourth wall. Or so she says. What follows are edited excerpts from a conversation with Ms. Young about the show.\nQ. What sparks your imagination about Elektra?\nA. I love the story because this woman is really so hard-core about her beliefs and her mission, and I can relate to that. I\u2019ve actually become a little less like that, due to my health issues.\nQ. You\u2019ve had problems with dizziness and insomnia.\nA. It\u2019s been like, O.K., I really have to pull away and take breaks and not work as hard until I\u2019m better. I\u2019m learning that everybody has a limit and maybe this character \u2014 you don\u2019t really see her limit, but she also hands a lot of stuff off to Orestes, her brother. She gives him the dirty work. It\u2019s all her plotting, and she\u2019s obviously very smart. Maybe I\u2019m learning from Elektra that sometimes you need to delegate.\nQ. What\u2019s it like to play Elektra?\nA. I feel like she is a part of me. I try to embrace the way that I\u2019m feeling in the moment and not fight it. That\u2019s something that I think I\u2019ve always done, and with Elektra I almost feel I\u2019m playing a rougher, more primitive version of myself. I definitely have anxiety and panic problems and issues that I would imagine that she has. Trauma. PTSD. [Laughs] Bailey Nolan is Chrysothemis, and in one section she dances with a tree branch. She hasn\u2019t done it in a long time, and you can tell that she\u2019s not as physically fit as she was, but that doesn\u2019t matter; you have to push yourself to the point where you feel you\u2019re going to pass out. Then we come together and we have to sing. I told her, \u201cIf your breathing is so heavy that you can\u2019t sing, I\u2019m going to follow your breath.\u201d That\u2019s maybe a strength of the work. It\u2019s pushing someone to surrender. That\u2019s not easy for people.\nThe beautiful part of that section is that you see her struggling. Chrysothemis is in between the mother, Klytemnestra, and Elektra. She\u2019s Switzerland in a way. She\u2019s doesn\u2019t really choose a side. I hate people like that. Make a choice.\nQ. In terms of movement, is \u201cElektra\u201d a return to choreography for you?\nA. It is a dance. And there\u2019s more dance movement in it than I have probably done in 10 years. I choreographed all of it, which was hard for me, because I hadn\u2019t done it in a while, but it was also so nice. I was having ear and dizziness issues. Using my voice was more difficult, so I was using my body, and movement is one of the things that\u2019s helping me so much. It\u2019s almost like a weird message: You need to move more.\nQ. What\u2019s with the pig?\nA. Her name is Daisy. She was named by Akiko [Ms. Young\u2019s 3-year-old daughter]. She\u2019s Akiko\u2019s pig, really; they have this really intense bond. She sleeps with Akiko sometimes, but she snorts a lot and so eventually I have to put her in her crate.\nQ. Why is Daisy in the show?\nA. In abusive situations, I always think of the dog in the corner that sees everything. What can the dog do but just watch? Or submit or whimper or go in the other room? It was important to me to have this pig because it represents the chorus or the support system for Elektra. She\u2019s really loud, and she\u2019s oinking constantly. Literally with each footstep is an oink. It\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s so good for the show.\nQ. Where did you find her?\nA. At a farm in New Jersey.\nQ. Will you keep her when this is over?\nA. I wish that I could keep her, but she\u2019s a proper farm potbellied pig. We\u2019ll keep her until we find a good home. We won\u2019t let her be made into ham. I would move for the pig. Michael [A. Guerrero, Ms. Young\u2019s partner] has been a really good sport, but the drive to get the pig was definitely very silent. The thing is, I did research; to rent a trained pig was going to be $3,000 for nine shows, not to mention the trainer, and then I found a pig on Craigslist for $75. I was like, I\u2019ve just got to buy the pig for budget purposes. I explained this to him, and he said, \u201cI know this is a trick.\u201d", "date": "Jan. 20, 2016", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/21/arts/dance/ann-liv-young-on-elektra-a-more-primitive-version-of-myself.html", "tags": "liv like a. \u2018 pig q. young really elektra primitive \u201d ann version \u2014"}
