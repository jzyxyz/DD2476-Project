{"title": "Theresa May, Britain\u2019s Lady of Perpetual Crisis", "content": "LONDON \u2014 It\u2019s Wednesday morning. Theresa May\u2019s career is over, as a glance at the morning papers will confirm.\nHer Brexit deal, the product of two and a half years of agonizing negotiation, has been rejected by a margin of 230 votes, in the worst defeat in British history. \u201cNo Deal \u2026 No Hope \u2026 No Clue \u2026 No Confidence,\u201d declares the Mirror. The Sun photoshops her face onto the body of a dodo.\nNow it\u2019s Wednesday afternoon. Hey! She\u2019s back!\n[What is Brexit? A simple guide to why it matters and what happens next.]\nThe Labour Party is making a bid to dissolve the government. Leaping to Mrs. May\u2019s defense like gallant knights are fellow Tories, among them many who have spent the last few months plotting to remove her.\n\u201cShe personifies duty, she is a patriot and a servant of our country,\u201d said one. Another praised her \u201cinspirational leadership.\u201d Yet another predicted that \u201cher stock in this country will rise dramatically.\u201d\nThis is the bizarro world that is British politics, a Groundhog Day in which Mrs. May awakes every day to discover herself in a dire political crisis, and every day survives, in her grim, implacable way.\nThe rallying of Tories against Labour\u2019s bid to bring down the government, which was defeated by a margin of 19 votes, did it again, the thing that had seemed impossible: It put wind into her sails.\n\u201cShe is indestructible,\u201d wrote Tom Peck, a sketch writer for the Independent, reflecting on the events of the day. \u201cShe is the cockroach in nuclear winter. She is the algae that survives on sulphuric gas from subaquatic volcanoes, seven miles beneath the daylight. She is the Nokia 5210.\u201d\nMrs. May rarely gives any sense of being chastened by a defeat, plowing ahead in the manner that earned her the nickname \u201cMaybot.\u201d\nStewart McDonald, a member of the Scottish National Party, grilled her on Wednesday for signs that she was ready to reconsider her Brexit strategy. She did not comply, responding with a set of now-familiar, automatic phrases, like \u201cdeliver Brexit for the British people,\u201d which sent Mr. McDonald into a spasm of frustration.\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to be helpful to the prime minister, believe it or not, but this is pure robotic fantasy,\u201d Mr. McDonald said. He grumbled about it later on Twitter, writing: \u201cI tried. But alas, the robot within the PM kicked in and she stuck to her script.\u201d\nThe day provided a number of surreal moments that tested the nation\u2019s storied capacity for calm.\nAt one point, Parliament broke away from the nonstop Constitutional brush fire surrounding Brexit \u2014 The Guardian chose to augment its masthead on Wednesday with a reproduction of Edvard Munch\u2019s \u201cThe Scream\u201d \u2014 to address an obscure motion banning the excessively low positioning of letter boxes.\nPostmen complain that low letter boxes can cause back pain or even, occasionally, hand injuries, explained a lawmaker, Vicky Ford, who noted with admiration that several European countries also regulate the size of letter box \u201capertures.\u201d\n\u201cI hope this will be a moment of unity in British politics,\u201d she said brightly.\nTen minutes, and it was back to the meltdown of British democracy.\nAs Conservative lawmakers lined up to express their loyalty to Mrs. May, Vicki Young, the BBC\u2019s chief political correspondent, marveled at their pivot from the day before, when many among them had been gleefully plotting to sink her hard-won Brexit deal.\nTheir circling of the wagons, she concluded, was \u201ctribal.\u201d As frustrated as they are with Mrs. May, Conservatives are desperate to avoid a change of government that would put Jeremy Corbyn, the head of the Labour Party, in office.\nMany of them feel sympathy for her, as well, believing that she was given an impossible task.\n\u201cIt feels like a parallel universe, doesn\u2019t it, considering where we were last night, just 24 hours ago,\u201d she said. \u201cI have to say, looking at the scenes in the last half-hour or so, it\u2019s the most united the Conservative benches have been, probably, for months.\u201d\nA notable tribute to Mrs. May came from Conservative lawmaker Mark Francois, a leader of the arch-Brexiteer European Research Group.\nMr. Francois, in November, submitted a scathing letter to the party\u2019s 1922 committee, which has the power to remove the party leader, saying Mrs. May \u201cjust doesn\u2019t listen\u201d and is \u201cin complete denial.\u201d Since then, he has missed no opportunity to criticize her deal, which he described as \u201crancid,\u201d and complained that, instead of submitting the deal to a vote, members of her government had \u201cgone and run away and hidden in the toilet.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Francois stood in her defense, acknowledging, to widespread laughter, that \u201cshe and I have not seen entirely eye to eye in the past.\u201d\n\u201cBut I am a Conservative first and last, and I know opportunism when I see it,\u201d he said. \u201cI can tell you, when the bells ring, the whole of the ERG will walk through the lobbies with her, to vote this nonsense down.\u201d\nThe failed challenge to Mrs. May\u2019s leadership came at just the right time, drawing attention away from the dismal failure of her Brexit bill, said Nikki da Costa, a former Downing Street staffer who now works as senior counsel for the Cicero Group, a consulting firm.\n\u201cWithout a doubt, it is a wonderful distraction,\u201d she said. \u201cIt moves the news story forward very, very quickly.\u201d\nIt does not, however, resolve the matter at hand.\nOn the heels of her crushing defeat on Tuesday, Mrs. May vowed to forge a deal that could win passage, but declined to offer specifics.\nThere is speculation that she could seek a postponement of the March 29 deadline, and agree to keep a permanent customs union with the European bloc. She said on Wednesday that she would invite opposition party leaders to discuss a compromise, but Mr. Corbyn asked her to first rule out leaving the European Union without any agreement.\nWhen historians relate the story of Brexit, they may not even recall Tuesday\u2019s epic defeat as the most important event of the week. One thing is certain: Mrs. May\u2019s survival provides a certain ballast as this process moves forward, Ms. da Costa said.\n\u201cAs the years go by, and the 24-hour news cycle passes, it will be interesting to know which bits stand in the memory,\u201d she said. \u201cCertainly the numbers for her defeat were very, very big yesterday. The fact that she is still standing suggests a strange form of stability.\u201d", "date": "Jan. 16, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/16/world/europe/britain-brexit-theresa-may.html", "tags": "brexit may theresa lady party \u201d britain perpetual wednesday crisis mrs. deal day"}
