{"title": "Stacey Abrams Ends Fight for Georgia Governor With Harsh Words for Her Rival", "content": "ATLANTA \u2014 Stacey Abrams ended her Democratic bid to become governor of Georgia on Friday, acknowledging that she did not have the votes to beat her Republican rival, Brian Kemp, but sounding a defiant note by declaring that an \u201cerosion of our democracy\u201d had kept many of her backers from the polls.\nThe narrow defeat of Ms. Abrams, who would have become the first black woman to be elected governor anywhere in the United States, as well as the apparent loss of Andrew Gillum, who sought to become Florida\u2019s first black governor, at once illuminated the vestiges of Southern history and demonstrated how demographic changes have taken hold across the region and begun to reshape its politics.\nThe two candidates ran as unabashed liberals and their strong showings in two pivotal states where Democrats have lately struggled is likely to keep the debate going within the Democratic Party over the best strategy for making gains in 2020. There is significant internal disagreement over which candidates the party ought to put forward and how they should run.\nThe race between Ms. Abrams and Mr. Kemp pitted two versions of Georgia against one another. Ms. Abrams, 44, represented the diverse future of the state and its capital, Atlanta, home to black colleges and a hub of black political power. Mr. Kemp, 55, who bragged he had a pickup truck big enough to \u201cround up criminal illegals,\u201d played to the state\u2019s rural voters and linked himself with President Trump. In the end, it was enough to allow the Republican Party to maintain its grip on power in Georgia, which has not elected a Democrat as governor since 1998.\nEven before Ms. Abrams ended her campaign, Mr. Kemp had been preparing to take control. He declared victory two days after the election and appointed a chief of staff for his transition. He also resigned as secretary of state, ending his oversight of the election in which he was a candidate. When he appeared at the State Capitol last week, he asserted that he had won \u201ca clear and convincing victory\u201d and pledged to \u201cput hard-working Georgians ahead of politics.\u201d\nMs. Abrams ran a type of campaign that modern Georgia had never seen before, relying on turnout among minority and low-frequency voters and championing an unflinchingly progressive message. In turn, she won in Democratic strongholds like Atlanta and Savannah, but also in the vote-rich Atlanta suburbs that were not long ago centers of Republican influence.\nWhile every Southern state has its liberal-leaning cities surrounded by conservative countryside, the divide is particularly pronounced in Georgia because of metropolitan Atlanta\u2019s immensity, its central role in the American civil rights movement, and the rapidly growing number of nonwhite people who have been choosing to live in the city\u2019s sprawling suburbs, which were once destinations for white flight.\nRural Georgia certainly has swaths of racial moderation and iterations of conservatism that are detached from white grievance. But there are also political attitudes, and ways of expressing them, that stand in stark contrast to a capital that has long offered itself to the world as a beacon of racial comity.\nRural Georgia is a place where the Confederate flag, for complex reasons, is still embraced by many white residents as a proud symbol of heritage. And some still display it as an overt symbol of white supremacy.\n\u201cWe\u2019re at least a pink state, if not a purple state,\u201d said Charles S. Bullock III, a professor of political science at the University of Georgia, of the close turnout. \u201cPart of that is the demographic change that the Democrats have been counting on.\u201d\nAs recently as the late 1990s, Professor Bullock said, white Georgians cast roughly three-quarters of the state\u2019s votes. In 2016, that figure fell closer to 60 percent. And he said he would be unsurprised if the white share of the vote in this year\u2019s balloting turned out to be even lower.\nMs. Abrams, while acknowledging Friday that she could not win, did not concede either.\n\u201cMore than 200 years into Georgia\u2019s democratic experiment, the state failed its voters,\u201d Ms. Abrams said, her voice alternating among anguish, contempt, frustration and outrage as she argued that \u201ceight years of systemic disenfranchisement, disinvestment and incompetence had its desired effect on the electoral process in Georgia.\u201d\nStill, it was the closest race for governor in Georgia since 1966. Ms. Abrams came within 18,000 votes of forcing a runoff, and about 55,000 votes of winning outright, in an election that drew almost four million ballots.\n\u201cLet\u2019s be clear: This is not a speech of concession because concession means to acknowledge an action is right, true or proper,\u201d Ms. Abrams said amid a blistering attack on Mr. Kemp\u2019s record as the state\u2019s chief elections regulator and on the balloting process in Georgia. \u201cAs a woman of conscience and faith, I cannot concede that.\u201d\nAs Ms. Abrams ended her campaign, she returned to a theme that had surfaced throughout: that Mr. Kemp, who was the Georgia secretary of state until the Thursday after the election, had used his position to suppress voting and ease his path into the governor\u2019s mansion.\nAlthough she pledged to pray for Mr. Kemp, she also uncorked a bracing indictment of his tenure as secretary of state, including the election last week. She excoriated a system, overseen by Mr. Kemp and legions of local officials, that left voters lawfully purged from the rolls, waiting in the rain and facing rejections of their ballots for arbitrary reasons.\n\u201cGeorgia citizens tried to exercise their constitutional rights and were still denied the ability to elect their leaders,\u201d she said. \u201cUnder the watch of the now former secretary of state, democracy failed Georgians of every political party, every race, every region. Again.\u201d\nMr. Kemp, who has defended his time as secretary of state and rebuffed Democratic attacks that he was an \u201carchitect of suppression,\u201d did not respond directly to Ms. Abrams\u2019s critiques on Friday night.\n\u201cThe election is over and hardworking Georgians are ready to move forward,\u201d Mr. Kemp said in a statement. \u201cWe can no longer dwell on the divisive politics of the past but must focus on Georgia\u2019s bright and promising future.\u201d\n[Here\u2019s Why Election Day Has Turned Into Election Week and a Half.]\nThe race presented residents with starkly different personalities, policies and visions for the nation\u2019s eighth-most populous state. In turn, the contest drew enormous attention and money, with more than $65 million in spending, including the primaries, and about 2.1 million early votes, easily breaking state records.\nMr. Kemp vowed to cut regulations and crack down on undocumented immigrants. He captured the Republican nomination in a July runoff, bolstered by Mr. Trump\u2019s support and by provocative television ads in which he brandished a shotgun at a teenager (to underscore his support for gun rights) and promised to round up \u201ccriminal illegals\u201d in his pickup truck.\nHis proposals, though sometimes vague, thrilled conservatives: a \u201cTrack and Deport\u201d plan that would \u201ccreate a comprehensive database to track criminal aliens in Georgia;\u201d new limits on the state\u2019s budget, sustaining the government\u2019s efforts to lure major economic projects; and an intensified focus on stopping gang activity.\nHe had not been the Republican establishment\u2019s first choice \u2014 the retiring Republican governor, Nathan Deal, endorsed one of Mr. Kemp\u2019s primary rivals before eventually offering his full-throated backing \u2014 and his hard-right tone sent waves of concern through the Georgia business community, which wields enormous influence.\nMs. Abrams, a Yale-educated tax lawyer raised by civil rights activists in coastal Mississippi, ran largely as an unapologetic liberal, promising to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act as a way to address the state\u2019s acute rural health care problem.\nThough she seemed most comfortable talking policy, her allies emphasized her place in the broader context of Southern history. In a campaign appearance, the television personality Oprah Winfrey spoke of the indignities suffered by nonwhite Georgians in the days of Jim Crow, saying that failing to vote now would be \u201cdisrespecting and disregarding\u201d those ancestors.\nAnd Democrats invested enormous hopes in Ms. Abrams\u2019s candidacy, betting that she would allow the party to rebound from a string of defeats in Georgia.\nEach side in the race tried to paint the other as extremist. Mr. Trump called Ms. Abrams \u201cone of the most extreme far-left politicians in the entire country\u201d and said she would \u201chave Georgia turn into Venezuela.\u201d Democrats said Mr. Kemp\u2019s shotgun ad showed him to be \u201creckless\u201d and \u201cirresponsible.\u201d\nBut the issue that seemed to electrify voters most in the final weeks was voting access, a particularly sensitive matter because Mr. Kemp was still overseeing elections.\nTwo days before the election, Mr. Kemp\u2019s office announced, citing scant evidence, that it was opening an inquiry into the state Democratic Party after what the office called \u201ca failed attempt to hack the state\u2019s voter registration system.\u201d Democrats denied any wrongdoing and called the announcement a political stunt.\nBut Mr. Kemp\u2019s record still gave Ms. Abrams\u2019s campaign a rallying cry even after the polls closed: \u201cCount every vote,\u201d her campaign manager repeatedly told the television cameras, asserting that it was not yet time for Ms. Abrams to concede.\nOn Friday evening in Atlanta, Ms. Abrams held true to that.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to hold public office if I have to scheme my way into the post because the title of governor isn\u2019t nearly as important as our shared title \u2014 voters,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that is why we fight on.\u201d", "date": "Nov. 16, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/16/us/elections/georgia-governor-race-kemp-abrams.html", "tags": "election harsh abrams words kemp rival georgia \u201d ms. stacey state ends fight governor"}
