{"title": "El-Sisi May Rule Egypt Until 2034 Under Parliamentary Plan", "content": "CAIRO \u2014 The Egyptian Parliament approved sweeping measures on Thursday that would allow President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi to extend his rule until 2034, further entrenching his authoritarian rule and enshrining in law the military\u2019s dominance over the country.\nThe vote by Parliament, whose workings are quietly managed by Mr. el-Sisi\u2019s intelligence agencies, sets in motion a fast-moving process of constitutional change that could culminate in a referendum within three months. The referendum\u2019s approval is seen as a foregone conclusion.\nThe changes formally confirm what has become evident to many Egyptians for years: The sweeping euphoria of 2011, when protests led to the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak, has given way to an even harsher brand of strongman rule under a leader who also intends to rule for decades, and perhaps for life.\nWashington\u2019s unquestioning embrace of Mr. el-Sisi, whom President Trump has called a \u201cgreat guy,\u201d emboldened the Egyptian leader to act with little fear of American pushback.\n\u201cProject to amend #Egypt constitution unfolding & in full throttle,\u201d the exiled opposition politician Mohamed ElBaradei, who resigned as vice president after Mr. el-Sisi\u2019s security forces massacred more than 800 protesters in 2013, wrote on Twitter last week. \u201cArab Spring in reverse!\u201d\nBut many other Egyptians could only muster a weary shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t really care,\u201d said Daniel, 31, a Cairo shopkeeper who declined to give a second name for fear of reprisals. \u201cSisi\u2019s going to stay in power anyway, amendments or not.\u201d\nThe proposed changes would allow Mr. el-Sisi, who is scheduled to step down in 2022, to run for two more six-year terms and would demolish the constitutional safeguards he introduced in 2014, a year after he came to power in a military takeover.\nMr. el-Sisi would have the power to appoint judges and the country\u2019s prosecutor general, while the top judiciary would be stripped of its ability to vet draft legislation.\nThe military, which the amendments declare as the \u201cguardian and protector\u201d of Egypt\u2019s Constitution, would control the appointment of the defense minister.\nIn Parliament, 484 of 596 lawmakers approved the changes, starting a process of deliberation and debate that is expected to led to a second, final vote two months from now. If that passes, a referendum would be held within one month, probably before the start of the holy month of Ramadan in early May.\nIn a letter, 10 Egyptian rights groups warned that the changes would permit Mr. el-Sisi to \u201cretain power for life and exercise unprecedented unilateral authority.\u201d\nNot long ago, Mr. el-Sisi promised he would not seek to extend his term of office. \u201cWe will not interfere,\u201d he told CNBC in November 2017, referring to the Constitution, adding that he was intent on \u201cpreserving two four-year terms.\u201d\nBut within months of a flawed presidential election in March, which Mr. el-Sisi won with 97 percent of the valid vote, his supporters started to raise the idea of constitutional amendments.\nSupporters say that Mr. el-Sisi needs to extend his rule to introduce urgent economic reforms and to stabilize Egypt after the turbulence unleashed by the Arab Spring in 2011. In speeches, Mr. el-Sisi frequently refers to chaos in Libya, Syria and Yemen as dark examples of what Egypt could become.\nMany Egyptians share those fears.\n\u201cYes, things have become more expensive,\u201d said Daniel, the shopkeeper, who supports Mr. el-Sisi. \u201cBut at least I can leave my house and go to work.\u201d\nBut stability has come at a high price in terms of civil liberties and human rights. The country has jailed tens of thousands of opponents, banned hundreds of websites and exerted tight control over the courts. The news media is almost entirely under government control and torture is common in Egyptian prisons, rights groups say.\nDespite those abuses, Mr. el-Sisi has been bolstered by strong support from Western and Arab leaders who view him as a bulwark against Islamist militancy as his forces fight an insurgency in Sinai. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo lavished praise on the Egyptian leader during a visit to Cairo in January.\nIn 2017, President Trump posed with Mr. el-Sisi and the Saudi king over a glowing orb, in a widely mocked image that, nonetheless, framed America\u2019s preferences in the Arab world.\nThe French president, Emmanuel Macron, visited Cairo recently to sign weapons deals, the latest of several European countries to cash in on Egypt\u2019s appetite for multibillion-dollar arms purchases. As lawmakers voted on Thursday, Mr. el-Sisi was in Munich for a global security forum.\nIn recent months, the General Intelligence Service, one of Egypt\u2019s three major security services, has convened near-daily meetings to coordinate plans for extending Mr. el-Sisi\u2019s term, according to Mada Masr, one of the few independent news media outlets in Egypt.\nThe meetings were led by the president\u2019s son, Mahmoud el-Sisi, who is a senior official in the General Intelligence Service, the outlet reported.\nIn Parliament on Wednesday, Speaker Ali Abdel Aal told lawmakers that \u201call opinions and trends\u201d would be incorporated into the debate about the changes. But Western diplomats in Cairo say the government seems intent on pushing them through as swiftly and as quietly as possible.\nMedia outlets have given only cursory coverage to the constitutional amendment. Live television coverage of often-chaotic parliamentary proceedings ended in 2017. Diplomats say that opposition lawmakers have been warned to temper any public criticism of the amendments.\nEgyptians ignore such warnings at their peril. Three of Mr. el-Sisi\u2019s rivals from last year\u2019s election remain in jail, and last week a court jailed 26 members of a grass-roots campaign that had opposed his re-election.\nHaitham Elhariri, one of the few lawmakers to speak openly against the changes, told Parliament on Wednesday that they \u201cviolate the core Constitution and violate the dignity of Egyptians.\u201d\n\u201cMost people respect and cherish the armed forces,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I object to having them enter the political sphere.\u201d\nMr. el-Sisi\u2019s desire to push through the amendments now may be driven by Egypt\u2019s faltering economy, analysts say. Harsh economic overhauls instituted by Mr. el-Sisi have won him praise and a $12 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund, but they have stirred quiet discontent among Egyptians struggling with soaring prices and cuts to fuel and electricity subsidies.\nBut his haste may also be influenced by the vagaries of American politics, said Andrew Miller of the Project on Middle East Democracy, a nonpartisan organization in Washington.\nWith the special investigator\u2019s investigation bearing down on the Trump administration, this is a good moment to make a contentious move with Mr. Trump\u2019s full, unfettered support, he suggested.\n\u201cEl-Sisi may see this as the safest time to seek relief,\u201d he said.\nThough the changes approved by Parliament on Thursday are provisional and could change before the final vote, as they stand, rights groups warn, they will seriously undermine judicial independence in Egypt.\n\u201cEl-Sisi\u2019s government is encouraged by the continued silence of its allies,\u201d said Michael Page of Human Rights Watch. \u201cIf the U.S., U.K. and France want to avoid the destabilizing consequences of entrenching authoritarian rule in Egypt, they should act now.\u201d", "date": "Feb. 14, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/world/middleeast/egypt-sisi.html", "tags": "parliamentary may \u201c egypt parliament would rule el-sisi changes plan"}
