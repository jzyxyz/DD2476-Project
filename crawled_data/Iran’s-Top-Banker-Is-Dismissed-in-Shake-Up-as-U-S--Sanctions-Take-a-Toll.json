{"title": "Iran\u2019s Top Banker Is Dismissed in Shake-Up as U.S. Sanctions Take a Toll", "content": "Iran\u2019s central banker was fired on Wednesday in the first senior shake-up since the United States abandoned the nuclear agreement nearly three months ago and restored sanctions, moves that worsened an already weak Iranian economy.\nThe dismissed official, Valiollah Seif, governor of the central bank for five years, had been widely assailed for what critics called his mismanagement of Iran\u2019s monetary policy, which contributed to a steep drop in the value of the country\u2019s rial currency.\nSome also faulted Mr. Seif for failing to foresee that the Trump administration would withdraw from the nuclear agreement, which had eased economic sanctions in return for curbs on Iran\u2019s nuclear work.\nPresident Trump\u2019s decision, announced in May, accelerated a capital flight from Iran that hastened the rial\u2019s decline, unnerving Iranians who saw it as a warning of economic calamity.\nMr. Seif may have been further impaired by the Trump administration\u2019s decision, after reimposing sanctions, to blacklist him for what it called his role in money transfers to Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant organization that the United States regards as a terrorist group. The blacklisting made it difficult for international bankers to deal with Mr. Seif without risking American penalties.\nHis departure, announced in Iran\u2019s state-run media, made Mr. Seif the first top official in President Hassan Rouhani\u2019s government to fall since the nuclear agreement began to unravel. Analysts expect more dismissals because of the tough new economic reality facing the nation of 80 million, where inflation and unemployment are on the rise.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s warning that buyers of Iranian oil must reduce their purchases and find other suppliers, which in principle could cripple Iran\u2019s most important export, has caused particular alarm.\nMr. Rouhani\u2019s administration had said that the nuclear agreement, reached in 2015, would bring prosperity after prolonged isolation, a miscalculation that has caused a political backlash against him and his top aides. Even after Mr. Trump was elected, there was still hope in Iran that his threat to scrap the nuclear agreement was just bluster.\n\u201cFrom November 2016 they should have seen the dark clouds \u2014 they were sleepwalking,\u201d said Djavad Salehi-Isfahani, a Brookings Institution scholar who is an expert on Iran\u2019s economy.\n\u201cIran has had a very large shock to the economy in the last few months. That\u2019s the Trump shock,\u201d he said. \u201cYou just can\u2019t have people in there who expected this not to happen.\u201d\nMr. Rouhani\u2019s announcement of the central bank change at a cabinet meeting appeared to reflect his concession that such steps were needed to counter the criticism. Mr. Seif\u2019s replacement, Abdolnaser Hemmati, a former economics professor, banker and insurance official, had been designated as Iran\u2019s next ambassador to China before he was abruptly summoned from Beijing for the new job.\nPressTV, an official Iranian news outlet, said Mr. Rouhani had described Mr. Hemmati as \u201can experienced banker and insurer, with good manners, high spirits and strong capabilities, recommending all members of the government to cooperate with him.\u201d\nPrecisely how Mr. Hemmati intends to slow or halt the fall in the rial\u2019s value remains unclear.\nIt took about 30,000 rials to buy $1 when Mr. Seif took over in 2013. Now it costs more than 90,000 to buy $1. By some estimates, Iranians have taken nearly $60 billion out of the country in the past few years.\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t think holding rials is the best way of preserving their savings,\u201d Mr. Salehi-Isfahani said.\nThe central bank shake-up came as Iran dismissed any prospect of talking with Mr. Trump, who on Tuesday appeared to keep open the possibility of negotiating a new agreement with Iran that he called \u201ca real deal,\u201d two days after he threatened Mr. Rouhani in an apocalyptic Twitter message.\nIran\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesman, Bahram Qassemi, said negotiations with the United States would never happen \u201cunder the shadow of threats,\u201d PressTV reported.\n\u201cThe United States should not bite off more than it can chew and should know its place in this era, and make further efforts to understand Iran\u2019s status, dignity and role,\u201d Mr. Qassemi was quoted as saying.", "date": "July 25, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/25/world/middleeast/iran-central-banker-sanctions.html", "tags": "agreement iran sanctions banker nuclear shake-up take toll u.s. seif \u201d rouhani dismissed top"}
