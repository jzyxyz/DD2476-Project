The LAPD, the report says,\u00a0shines in its use of technology and social media.\nBut not everyone agrees with that assessment.\u00a0The Los Angeles chapter of Black Lives Matter considers such praise so wrongheaded that the activists are protesting Lynch\u2019s visit.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge slap in the face. It\u2019s a huge insult to black people and the people of Los Angeles,\u201d Melina Abdullah, an organizer for Black Lives Matter Los Angeles, told The Huffington Post. \u201cTheir use of social media is really surveilling us.\u201d\nHamid Khan, the coordinator for the Stop LAPD Spying Coalition, is equally baffled by the recognition from the Justice Department.\nThe LAPD has used cutting-edge technology to create\u00a0\u201ca massive architecture of surveillance and spying and infiltration,\u201d he said.\nHis coalition's\u00a0website lays out how the department watches the city\u2019s residents. Stingrays and DRT boxes are used to track, intercept data on and sometimes jam mobile phones. Street cameras employ highly accurate facial recognition technology.\u00a0License plate readers, drones and even police body cameras help the department know where people are and when. \u00a0\nThis wealth of data -- which is collected even on individuals who haven\u2019t committed crimes\u00a0-- fuels the LAPD's predictive policing model, which the coalition asserts is used to \u201ccrunch crime statistics and other data with algorithms to \u2018predict\u2019 when and where future crimes are most likely to occur.\u201d\u00a0\nEven police efforts to interact through social media can have a sinister edge. Tweeting out to the community is one thing. Tracking the online activities of people who are, after all, just exercising their rights to civil protest is another \u00a0-- and Abdullah, for one, fears the latter is happening.\nIn other words, Khan said, the LAPD -- and other police departments --\u00a0\u201care incorporating and codifying counterterrorism and counterinsurgency methodology and tactics into their daily policing.\u201d\nThe LAPD declined to comment on its use of technology to surveil citizens. A\u00a0Justice Department spokesman said that Lynch was simply in the city \u201cto highlight ways in which the LAPD uses social media and technology to positively engage the LA community.\u201d \nOn Wednesday, Lynch attended a briefing at the LAPD Real Time Analysis and Critical Response Division. It's\u00a0the department\u2019s first fusion center\u00a0--\u00a0a place where it gathers, analyzes and shares information to scope out alleged threats. \nOr Khan put it, \u201cto spy and to gather information on people.\u201d\nLAPD\u2019s participation\u00a0in the Nationwide Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR) Initiative, for instance, has been heavily criticized for the activities that it deems to be suspicious. These include \u201csuspected pre-operational surveillance\u201d (using a camera or binoculars), \u201ccounter-surveillance efforts\u201d (doubling back, evasive driving or changing your appearance), and taking measurements (counting footsteps). \nAny of these innocuous behaviors can lead the police to write up a secret file on an individual and upload it into a database accessible to every law enforcement agency in the country, Khan said. \nAnd the SAR program doesn't surveil the city's residents equally.\u00a0Over 30 percent of suspicious activity reports involved black Los Angelenos and 50 percent of the women surveilled were black, according to an inspector general's audit\u00a0of the program in January 2015. Black people comprise 9.6 percent of the city\u2019s population.\n\u201cThese are the tools for racial profiling,\u201d Khan said. \u00a0\nBeyond the surveillance, Abdullah takes issue with the Justice Department honoring what she called \u201cthe most murderous police department in the entire country.\u201d\nIn 2015, LAPD officers shot 38 people -- and killed 21 of them. The number killed, according to NPR, tops the number of people shot to death by police in several of the nation's other largest cities, including Chicago, Houston and Philadelphia. The LAPD also saw an uptick of deaths in custody\u00a0last year.\nAt least eight people have been killed by on-duty LAPD officers this year, according to The Counted.\nLately, officers have also been cracking down on dissent at the public meetings of the Los Angeles Police Commission, Abdullah said.\n\u201cThis is the first week in four weeks that there have been no arrests for showing up at the oversight body public meeting,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so, I\u2019m really angry that the attorney general is turning a blind eye to that.\u201d\nLast week, an 81-year-old man was\u00a0dragged out of the meeting and arrested for speaking off topic. The week before, someone was arrested for filming the meeting, Abdullah said. On another occasion, a civilian was detained for walking out the wrong door. Abdullah herself was arrested for going over the two-minute speaking limit, she said.\nThe Los Angeles Police Commission did not respond to a request for comment.\nConsidering all of these events, Abdullah said she can't understand why the attorney general would highlight the LAPD as a pillar of community policing.\u00a0\nInitially, she thought that Lynch was actually going to present the LAPD with the Attorney General\u2019s Distinguished Service in Community Policing award. She even started a petition calling out the police department\u2019s \u201clong and deep history of corruption that continues in their current practices.\u201d\u00a0But there will be no award.\nStill, Abdullah said of the attorney general, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to me that, as a black woman, you can turn a blind eye to what LAPD has a history of doing and continues to do.\u201d", "date": "\n06/30/2016", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/black-lives-matter-los-angeles-police_n_57743668e4b0cc0fa13666dc", "tags": "people los savvy- spies tech department \u201d tools- police praising -- abdullah attorney general digital lapd"}
