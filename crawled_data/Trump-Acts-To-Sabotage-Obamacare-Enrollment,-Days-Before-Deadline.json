{"title": "Trump Acts To Sabotage Obamacare Enrollment, Days Before Deadline", "content": "President Donald Trump isn\u2019t waiting for Congress to repeal the Affordable Care Act. \nHe\u2019s trying to undermine it right now.\nAs Politico\u2019s Paul Demko first reported on Thursday evening, the Department of Health and Human Services has cancelled a final burst of television and radio advertising designed to encourage people to sign up for Obamacare insurance plans.\nThe Obama administration had arranged for the ads, and paid for them, before leaving office. A senior HHS communications adviser, who declined to give his name, said the Trump administration decided to stop the advertising for the sake of efficiency, and to save on the $5 million that the campaign would have cost.\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t going to continue spending millions of taxpayers\u2019 dollars promoting a failed government program,\u201d the HHS official said. \u201cOnce an assessment was made, we pulled back the most expensive and least efficient part of this massive ad campaign, which was set to run over the weekend. \u00a0Those costs savings will be returned to the U.S. Treasury.\u201d\nDemko\u2019s story reported that HHS was also halting other efforts, as well, including direct emails and automatic phone calls to individuals who had previously registered at Healthcare.gov (the government\u2019s website for buying insurance) and had yet to get coverage.\nBut some outreach emails went out on Friday anyway, and it wasn\u2019t clear whether the Trump administration had always intended to continue the email effort, whether administration officials had changed their minds, or whether the Friday emails were the result of some kind of administrative error.\n(The unnamed HHS official told The Huffington Post that email and automatic phone calls were among the outreach tools that \u201cremained available\u201d to the agency, but he would not clarify exactly what that meant.)\nWhatever the precise details of the policy change, the timing is critical. The open enrollment period for 2017 ends next week, on Jan. 31, and traditionally, signups have surged in the final days before the deadline.\nThose late signups don\u2019t merely boost the program\u2019s enrollment numbers. They also help insurers to hold down premiums.\nThat\u2019s because insurance depends on premiums from healthy people to underwrite the medical bills of the small minority with serious health problems. And people in relatively good health are precisely the types to postpone enrolling until the very last minute.\nDuring last year\u2019s open enrollment, for example, the percentage of 18-to-34-year-olds signing up for coverage increased with time. It would spike at each meaningful deadline, such as the final day to get coverage in time for Jan. 1, and then again the final day to get coverage for the year.\nIn the week of that last deadline, young people made up 37 percent of enrollees, up from 22 percent at the start of open enrollment.\nThursday\u2019s news came \u00a0just hours after Trump addressed fellow Republicans in Philadelphia, and repeated an argument he and other GOP leaders have made many times: that the Affordable Care is collapsing because insurers, unable to attract a balanced risk pool, have been losing money, raising prices, and in some cases pulling out of markets altogether.\nReality is actually quite different. Although insurers in many states have struggled, markets in other states are stable. Recent news suggests that this year\u2019s steep price increases for some may be a one-time correction. \nMeanwhile, the number of Americans without health insurance has plummeted to a historic low and, this year, enrollment has actually been running slightly ahead of last year\u2019s pace.\nAt least, it had been running ahead \u2015 until now. \nKevin Counihan, who was chief executive officer for HealthCare.gov and before that managed the state exchange in Connecticut, warned that halting outreach now could undermine the program in the future.\n\u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s outrageous decision tonight to sabotage open enrollment will mean coverage could cost more next year and insurers could drop out of the marketplace,\u201d Counihan said. \n\u201cHaving health insurance is still law of the land,\u201d Counihan said. \u201cIf the president and Republicans in Congress want to change that, they should come up with a plan and show it to the American people, rather than depriving Americans of the chance to sign up for coverage and financial assistance they remain eligible for.\u201d\nJosh Peck,\u00a0who worked on the last three open enrollment periods and just stepped down as chief marketing officer for Healthcare.gov, told The Huffington Post that HHS did extensive research into which outreach efforts worked and tailored its campaigns accordingly \u2015 focusing specifically on those most likely to yield the most signups.\u00a0HHS found that simply reminding people of the final date, particularly by email, was the most effective tactic, Peck said.\nPeck noted that HHS doesn\u2019t spend money on emails, the way it does for television or digital ads, so canceling those would seem particularly ill-advised.\n\u201cThey are shutting down outreach efforts that are effectively free,\u201d Peck said. \u201cOne of the most effective things we do in the final days is to email people, just to let them know the date of the deadline. That\u2019s all bought and paid for already. Taxpayers will not save a single cent by not sending emails in those final days. I can\u2019t fathom what claim of efficiency can be involved there.\u201d\u00a0\nThe HHS official said the department would continue to answer email and telephone questions about enrollment. He added that radio and television advertising would continue to run where it was not possible to get the money back.\nThis article has been updated to include comments from Josh Peck and an unnamed HHS official.", "date": "\n01/26/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-obamacare-enrollment_n_588a9451e4b0230ce61b0b40", "tags": "coverage obamacare hhs days trump deadline \u201d final acts year said sabotage enrollment"}
