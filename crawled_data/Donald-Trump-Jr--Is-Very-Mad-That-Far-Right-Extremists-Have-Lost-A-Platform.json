{"title": "Donald Trump Jr- Is Very Mad That Far-Right Extremists Have Lost A Platform", "content": "\u00a0\n\ufeffDonald Trump Jr.\u00a0hit the fear-mongering roof after it was announced Thursday that a number of far-right extremists will no longer be able to use Facebook and Instagram to peddle hate and lies.\nThe president\u2019s oldest son tweeted on Friday that conservatives are being silenced by Facebook and \u201cBig Tech,\u201d an unfounded claim that has nonetheless become a popular talking point among some Republicans.\nLet\u2019s take a look at the far-right fanatics banned from Facebook that Trump Jr. seems so eager to defend.\nAlex Jones, host of the conspiracy theory-promoting radio show Infowars, is currently being\u00a0sued by nine family members of victims killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. The families are taking Jones to court for his repeated lies about the shooting being a \u201cfalse flag\u201d operation, lies that have led to death threats\u00a0against Sandy Hook families from Jones\u2019 manipulated listeners. A longtime contributor to Infowars, Paul Joseph Watson, was also banned from Facebook.\u00a0\nMilo Yiannopoulos\u00a0has spent the entirety of his career whipping up attention by expressing racist views. The polemicist was recently banned from Australia after blaming \u201cextremist leftism\u201d and \u201calien religious cultures\u201d for the shooting at two New Zealand mosques that left 51 people dead. Prior to his Instagram account being taken down, Yiannopoulos was busy using the platform to sell off personal items, including a portrait of himself.\u00a0\nLaura Loomer\u00a0is a racist conspiracy theorist who routinely attacks Muslims online. She wasn\u2019t banned from Instagram until Thursday, even after she\u2019d called on her followers to \u201crise up\u201d\u00a0against Rep.\u00a0Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), who is Muslim. Loomer recently made headlines for\u00a0handcuffing herself to the doors of Twitter\u2019s New York office\u00a0after she was kicked off the platform. Twitter said she could stay chained to the doors as long as she wanted.\u00a0\nPaul Nehlen, one of those supposed \u201cconservatives\u201d described by Trump Jr., is actually a white nationalist. He recently appeared on a podcast where he discussed the best way\u00a0to start a race war.\nLouis Farrakhan, the longtime Nation of Islam leader, was also banned from Facebook. Farrakhan is a known anti-Semite who has also attacked the LGBTQ community.\nBut Trump Jr. argued that Americans should be terrified by Facebook\u2019s decision to draw a line.\n\u201cAsk yourself, how long before they come to purge you?\u201d he wrote.\nThe answer to that is simple: If you don\u2019t traffic in hate, you won\u2019t get \u201cpurged.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0", "date": "\n05/03/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-jr-far-right-extremists-facebook_n_5ccc65a8e4b0548b73597556", "tags": "shooting mad jr. extremists jones jr- \u201d trump lost facebook donald banned lies instagram far-right platform"}
