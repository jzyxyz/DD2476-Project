That was the question when the Berlin Wall came down in 1989 and Germany reunified and had to decide on a capital.\nDuring the years of Cold War division, Bonn was the capital of West Germany and east Berlin was the capital of East Germany (the German Democratic Republic).\nToday, few of the travellers thronging Berlin's nightclubs and taking pictures of the wall's colourful remnants may know about Bonn - but the decision on which two cities became the capital actually came down to just a few votes in the Bundestag on 20 June 1991. Berlin triumphed with 337 votes to Bonn's 320. \nAnd while Germans fought over two prospective capitals, South Africa actually has three.\nThe branches of government are split between Cape Town (legislative), Pretoria (administrative) and Bloemfontein (judiciary), though the Constitutional Court is in Johannesburg.\nThis dates back to the creation of the Union of South Africa in 1910 after four British colonies were unified and agreement could not be reached on where the capital would be located.\nIn 1994, after apartheid ended, there was a movement for a new capital to be created \u00e0 la Canberra or Brasilia - to allow a fresh start, but this never happened. \nAstana - which became the capital of Kazakhstan in 1997 - is a gleaming futuristic playground and a totem to the ambitions of authoritarian president Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has ruled since 1991.\nAmong the landmarks are the Palace of Peace and Harmony - a concrete and glass pyramid designed by Norman Foster that boasts a 1,500-seat opera venue.\nThis windswept city in the frozen steppe was briefly called Akmola but changed to Astana because the former means \"white grave\".\nThe pyramid that reveals Kazakhstan's ambitions\nAnother country - Myanmar (formerly Burma) - also has a remote capital city, and its one is four times the size of London.\nNay Pyi Taw was built in 2005 as an isolated refuge for the paranoid military government, at a time before the country began its rocky transition to democracy.\nThe huge capital has everything - huge roads, a zoo and golf courses - but few people.", "date": "6 December 2017", "href": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-42258989", "tags": "built us city israel bonn capital represent cities south government berlin canberra chosen"}
