{"title": "Nikolaj Coster-Waldau Has A Perfect Theory On Valyrian Steel Owners", "content": "Jaime Lannister may be expecting a baby with his sister (ew), but he should probably start preparing for another life-changing event, at least according to actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau.\u00a0\nCoster-Waldau, who plays Jaime on \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d knows winter is here and more White Walkers are coming. (Plus, there\u2019s an ice dragon now, so bundle up.)\nIf he gets his way, however, those who possess Valryian steel weapons will come together as the crew that saves Westeros \u2015 and they just might take down the army of the dead and destroy the Night King.\u00a0\n\u201cWe all know this Valyrian steel, that\u2019s a good thing to have,\u201d the actor told HuffPost during a Build Series interview last week. \u201cWe know there are a few swords around ... I\u2019d hope he\u2019d be involved in the end.\u201d\nOf course, Valryian steel is one of the only substances \u2015 along with dragonglass (also called obsidian) \u2015 known to kill White Walkers. Currently, there are five characters on the show who own Valyrian steel: Jaime has Widow\u2019s Wail, Brienne of Tarth (Gwendoline Christie) has Oathkeeper, Jon Snow (Kit Harington) wields Longclaw, Sam Tarly (John Bradley) stole Heartsbane, and now Sansa (Sophie Turner) holds possession of Littlefinger\u2019s (Aiden Gillen) steel dagger after Arya (Maisie Williams) gave it to her during the latest episode.\u00a0\n\u201cMy theory \u2015 and I don\u2019t know, seriously, I don\u2019t know. I want this to be the truth: that they have to work together. I think that\u2019s the point, they have to get together,\u201d Coster-Waldau said of the owners of these weapons. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s one guy who\u2019s going to go, \u2018Yes! I got him!\u2019 If anyone should kill the Night King, I think it\u2019s going to be Jon Snow \u2015 we\u2019ve got to have Jon Snow in there \u2015 but I think that it\u2019s going to be all of them together, hopefully.\u201d\nAlthough Valyrian steel is a little more common in George R.R. Martin\u2019s books, it\u2019s extremely hard to come by on the show. That gives the five possessors listed above a greater reason to get their crap together before it\u2019s too late.\u00a0\nStill, there just might be another way to make a few more of these handy weapons \u2015 with help from Gendry (Joe Dempsie).\nNow that he\u2019s no longer rowing, Robert Baratheon\u2019s blacksmithing bastard may have the ability to reforge Valryian steel swords, which are said to be made using dragon fire and magic.\u00a0He\u2019s seen the dragons, as well as the magic \u2015 it makes perfect sense he\u2019ll be a savior in his own right. (Also, that boy can run.)\nAs Redditor jorywea78 wrote last month:\u00a0\nInteresting ...\nNo matter what happens with the steel situation, Coster-Waldau is very much for a Jaime-Jon partnership and hopes that one day they can put their differences aside to fight their common enemy.\u00a0\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be nice if they were on the same side fighting? All these people could finally go, \u2019OK, maybe we should worry about that guy with the spiky head and blue eyes,\u2019\u201d the actor said, adding that he thinks \u201cCersei\u2019s rule will end.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s that good of a queen,\u201d he joked. \u201cJon Snow would be good as the king and then they would be buddies, and Tyrion will also be there, and he\u2019ll like his brother again.\u201d\u00a0\nSounds like a fairy tale, Nikolaj. Call up George and share your wisdom.\u00a0\nThe \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d finale airs Sunday at 9 p.m. ET on HBO.
