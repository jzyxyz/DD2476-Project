Tillerson once admitted that he had never known a single American diplomat before joining the Trump administration, a surprising admission for a well-traveled executive that many in Foggy Bottom found insulting and dispiriting.\nBy contrast, his successor, Mike Pompeo, assured hundreds of diplomats on Tuesday that he not only knew many of them already, but that he also had a deep appreciation for their work and commitment to the United States.\n\u201cYou chose to be a foreign service officer, or a civil servant, or to come work here in many other capacities \u2014 and to do so because you\u2019re patriots, and great Americans, and because you want to be an important part of America\u2019s face to the world,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said in brief remarks during a formal arrival ceremony at the department\u2019s headquarters.\n\u201cMy mission will be to lead you and allow you to do that, the very thing you came here to do,\u201d he said, to great applause. Mr. Pompeo also promised the crowd that he would help American diplomats regain their \u201cswagger,\u201d alluding to a department that had been diminished under Mr. Tillerson.\nMr. Tillerson pushed out hundreds of the State Department\u2019s most experienced leaders. He spent $12 million on corporate consultants in a fruitless reorganization project led by young business professionals who had to be told that Ottawa, Canada\u2019s capital, was in a foreign country. And he sometimes met with foreign leaders and then refused to tell American diplomats who dealt with those countries what was said.\nOn Wednesday, for Mr. Pompeo\u2019s ceremonial swearing in, President Trump will take his first trip to the State Department. It will signal to the world \u2014 and, perhaps just as important, to the rest of his administration \u2014 that Mr. Pompeo is now in charge of the United States\u2019 foreign policy.\nMr. Tillerson never got that kind of forceful endorsement and was often undercut by Mr. Trump openly disagreeing with him. The president also gave some of the administration\u2019s most important foreign policy assignments to Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser, including an effort to broker peace in the Middle East and another to rescue the relationship with Mexico. And Mr. Tillerson never visited Israel without the president, an extraordinary hole in his travel itinerary.\nMr. Pompeo fixed that omission almost immediately, hopping on a government jet hours after his Senate confirmation on Friday for a four-day trip to Belgium, Saudi Arabia, Israel and Jordan.\nThe trip sent \u201ca pretty clear signal that the new secretary of state intends to establish himself as the major force in the administration\u2019s foreign policy,\u201d said Aaron David Miller, a former top Middle East negotiator at the department.\nMr. Pompeo has promised to spend the next several weeks in Washington sorting out the mess that Mr. Tillerson left behind.\nThere are scores of top positions in the State Department that have been left vacant for more than a year, including ambassadorships in South Korea, Saudi Arabia and Qatar. And in Mr. Pompeo\u2019s office sit more than 1,400 memos needing his approval for significant spending decisions \u2014 decisions Mr. Tillerson never got around to making.\nAs important, in the coming weeks, Mr. Pompeo faces crucial deadlines involving Russia, North Korea, Syria, China and Venezuela. He must also mend some of the United States\u2019 closest alliances that are on shakier ground than they have been in decades.\nEuropean allies, for instance, are worried that Mr. Trump will soon  start a trade war against them and renounce the Iran nuclear accord, a pact many see as vital to their national security.\nMr. Trump also faces a potential trade war with China and an increasingly combative relationship with Russia, and he has unnerved Japan with his plans for a summit meeting with Kim Jong-un, North Korea\u2019s leader.\nMr. Pompeo has promised that he would soon speak in more detail to the State Department about his plans and leadership strategy.\nBut on Tuesday, he simply tried to reassure a dispirited diplomatic corps that they need \u201cto be in every corner, every stretch of the world, executing missions on behalf of this country.\u201d\n\u201cAnd it is my humble, noble undertaking to help you achieve that.\u201d", "date": "May 1, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/01/world/americas/pompeo-swagger-state-department.html", "tags": "swagger \u2018 return department pompeo promises state foreign \u2014 tillerson"}
