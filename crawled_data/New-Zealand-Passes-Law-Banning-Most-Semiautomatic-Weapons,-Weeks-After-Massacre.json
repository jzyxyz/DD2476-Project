{"title": "New Zealand Passes Law Banning Most Semiautomatic Weapons, Weeks After Massacre", "content": "WELLINGTON, New Zealand \u2014 Less than a month after 50 Muslim worshipers in the city of Christchurch were fatally shot in terrorist attacks on two mosques, New Zealand passed a law banning most semiautomatic weapons on Wednesday \u2014 a measure supported by all but one of Parliament\u2019s 120 lawmakers.\nThe passage of the bill means temporary restrictions imposed by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern six days after the massacre, to prevent New Zealanders from stockpiling guns before the law went into effect, will now be permanent. The swift action by lawmakers stands in stark contrast to similar efforts in the United States, where nationwide gun control proposals have stalled despite a series of mass shootings in recent years.\n\u201cNew Zealand stands apart in its widespread availability of weapons of such destructive nature and force,\u201d Ms. Ardern told Parliament on Wednesday. \u201cToday that anomaly ends.\u201d\nShe said she could not have faced the surviving victims of the Christchurch attack \u201chand on heart\u201d and told them \u201cour system and our laws allow these guns to be available and that is O.K. It is not.\u201d\nThe law outlaws military-style semiautomatic weapons and assault rifles, and violators face five years in prison. Some semiautomatic guns will still be allowed, including .22-caliber rifles with magazines holding fewer than 10 rounds, and shotguns with internal magazines that hold no more than five rounds. All of the weapons used by the Christchurch gunman will be banned, as well as parts and magazines that can convert lower-powered guns to higher-powered versions.\nIn her speech, Ms. Ardern, who leads the center-left Labour Party, choked up when she talked about visiting surviving victims at Christchurch Hospital. In addition to those killed, 50 people were injured in the attack.\n\u201cNone of them had one gunshot wound. In every case they spoke of multiple injuries,\u201d Ms. Ardern said. \u201cThey will carry disabilities for a lifetime, and that\u2019s before you even consider the psychological impact.\u201d\nSimilar laws had been recommended to New Zealand\u2019s Parliament several times before, but each time they had failed to gain support from lawmakers \u2014 including after the mass shooting that had previously been New Zealand\u2019s largest, in which a gunman killed 13 people in 1990.\nThis time, the bill quickly sailed through Parliament. Usually in New Zealand, new laws can take around six months to pass after they are introduced. More than 13,000 people submitted opinions to the government \u2014 60 percent in support of the ban \u2014 and some were invited to speak to lawmakers in a single day of public hearings.\nBut while sports shooters and farmers were among those who pleaded for exemptions to the restrictions, lawmakers allowed just two: for commercial pest-control businesses and for licensed collectors of guns, or those who want to keep particular guns as heirlooms or mementos. Collectors will be required to remove a part, making the weapons nonoperational, and store that part at a different location.\nMs. Ardern\u2019s center-right opponents used their speeches on Wednesday to praise her leadership since the March 15 attacks and voice their support for the changes. Just one, David Seymour, the leader of the libertarian ACT Party, voted against the law.\nMr. Seymour said he was not opposed to more restrictive gun laws but believed that Parliament had rushed the process. \u201cIt is not an attempt to improve public safety, it is an exercise in political theater,\u201d said Mr. Seymour, who argued that there was a risk of a growing black market in banned weapons.\nMs. Ardern had dismissed concerns that Parliament was moving too fast. \u201cMy question here is simple: You either believe that in New Zealand these weapons have a place or you do not. And if you do not, you should be able to agree that we can move swiftly,\u201d she said. \u201cMy view is that an argument about process is an argument to do nothing.\u201d\nMany commentators welcomed the new measures but said work remained to be done to ensure that gun regulations were properly enforced. The government said more measures, including a requirement to register individual firearms, would be in place by the end of the year.\n\u201cWe really need to have a system where we understand where all the firearms in New Zealand are,\u201d said Chris Cahill, president of the Police Association, a national union for police officers. He added that gun owners should be forced to justify wanting to own large numbers of guns, something he said \u201chadn\u2019t been challenged enough\u201d in the past.\nNew Zealand\u2019s Muslim leaders agreed that the new law should be just a starting point for more regulation.\n\u201cThis is a law that should have been passed many years ago,\u201d said Mustafa Farouk, the president of the Federation of Islamic Associations of New Zealand. Speaking of the families of the victims, he said, \u201cPassing that law is part of justice for them.\u201d\nBecause Britain\u2019s Queen Elizabeth II is technically New Zealand\u2019s head of state, her representative, New Zealand\u2019s governor-general, will now give the final approval to pass the bill into law. This is considered a formality, and is due to happen Thursday.\nThe government has also established a gun buyback plan, which will run for six months for legal owners of the weapons now banned.\nJohn Hart, a sheep and beef farmer from Masterton on New Zealand\u2019s North Island, said he had already turned in one weapon \u2014 which he had owned for 10 years \u2014 to the police, because after the attacks he felt \u201cuncomfortable\u201d in possession of it.\n\u201cIn the weeks or months or years before Friday the 15th, I hadn\u2019t thought about it. It was just a tool,\u201d he said, adding that after the shootings he realized that in the wrong hands \u201cit was a terrible weapon.\u201d", "date": "April 10, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/world/asia/new-zealand-guns-jacinda-ardern.html", "tags": "passes semiautomatic weeks massacre parliament zealand \u201d weapons guns new banning \u2014 law"}
