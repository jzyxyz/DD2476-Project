{"title": "Investigating Donald Trump, F.B.I. Sees No Clear Link to Russia", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 For much of the summer, the F.B.I. pursued a widening investigation into a Russian role in the American presidential campaign. Agents scrutinized advisers close to Donald J. Trump, looked for financial connections with Russian financial figures, searched for those involved in hacking the computers of Democrats, and even chased a lead \u2014 which they ultimately came to doubt \u2014 about a possible secret channel of email communication from the Trump Organization to a Russian bank.\nLaw enforcement officials say that none of the investigations so far have found any conclusive or direct link between Mr. Trump and the Russian government. And even the hacking into Democratic emails, F.B.I. and intelligence officials now believe, was aimed at disrupting the presidential election rather than electing Mr. Trump.\nHillary Clinton\u2019s supporters, angry over what they regard as a lack of scrutiny of Mr. Trump by law enforcement officials, pushed for these investigations. In recent days they have also demanded that James B. Comey, the director of the F.B.I., discuss them publicly, as he did last week when he announced that a new batch of emails possibly connected to Mrs. Clinton had been discovered.\nSupporters of Mrs. Clinton have argued that Mr. Trump\u2019s evident affinity for Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin \u2014 Mr. Trump has called him a great leader and echoed his policies toward NATO, Ukraine and the war in Syria \u2014 and the hacks of leading Democrats like John D. Podesta, the chairman of the Clinton campaign, are clear indications that Russia has taken sides in the presidential race and that voters should know what the F.B.I. has found.\nThe F.B.I.\u2019s inquiries into Russia\u2019s possible role continue, as does the investigation into the emails involving Mrs. Clinton\u2019s top aide, Huma Abedin, on a computer she shared with her estranged husband, Anthony D. Weiner. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s supporters argue that voters have as much right to know what the F.B.I. has found in Mr. Trump\u2019s case, even if the findings are not yet conclusive.\n\u201cYou do not hear the director talking about any other investigation he is involved in,\u201d Representative Gregory W. Meeks, Democrat of New York, said after Mr. Comey\u2019s letter to Congress was made public. \u201cIs he investigating the Trump Foundation? Is he looking into the Russians hacking into all of our emails? Is he looking into and deciding what is going on with regards to other allegations of the Trump Organization?\u201d\nMr. Comey would not even confirm the existence of any investigation of Mr. Trump\u2019s aides when asked during an appearance in September before Congress. In the Obama administration\u2019s internal deliberations over identifying the Russians as the source of the hacks, Mr. Comey also argued against doing so and succeeded in keeping the F.B.I.\u2019s imprimatur off the formal findings, a law enforcement official said. His stance was first reported by CNBC.\nSenator Harry Reid of Nevada, the minority leader, responded angrily on Sunday with a letter accusing the F.B.I. of not being forthcoming about Mr. Trump\u2019s alleged ties with Moscow.\n\u201cIt has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisers, and the Russian government \u2014 a foreign interest openly hostile to the United States, which Trump praises at every opportunity,\u201d Mr. Reid wrote. \u201cThe public has a right to know this information.\u201d\nF.B.I. officials declined to comment on Monday. Intelligence officials have said in interviews over the last six weeks that apparent connections between some of Mr. Trump\u2019s aides and Moscow originally compelled them to open a broad investigation into possible links between the Russian government and the Republican presidential candidate. Still, they have said that Mr. Trump himself has not become a target. And no evidence has emerged that would link him or anyone else in his business or political circle directly to Russia\u2019s election operations.\nAt least one part of the investigation has involved Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign chairman for much of the year. Mr. Manafort, a veteran Republican political strategist, has had extensive business ties in Russia and other former Soviet states, especially Ukraine, where he served as an adviser to that country\u2019s ousted president, Viktor F. Yanukovych.\nBut the focus in that case was on Mr. Manafort\u2019s ties with a kleptocratic government in Ukraine \u2014 and whether he had declared the income in the United States \u2014 and not necessarily on any Russian influence over Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, one official said.\nIn classified sessions in August and September, intelligence officials also briefed congressional leaders on the possibility of financial ties between Russians and people connected to Mr. Trump. They focused particular attention on what cyberexperts said appeared to be a mysterious computer back channel between the Trump Organization and the Alfa Bank, which is one of Russia\u2019s biggest banks and whose owners have longstanding ties to Mr. Putin.\nF.B.I. officials spent weeks examining computer data showing an odd stream of activity to a Trump Organization server and Alfa Bank. Computer logs obtained by The New York Times show that two servers at Alfa Bank sent more than 2,700 \u201clook-up\u201d messages \u2014 a first step for one system\u2019s computers to talk to another \u2014 to a Trump-connected server beginning in the spring. But the F.B.I. ultimately concluded that there could be an innocuous explanation, like a marketing email or spam, for the computer contacts.\nThe most serious part of the F.B.I.\u2019s investigation has focused on the computer hacks that the Obama administration now formally blames on Russia. That investigation also involves numerous officials from the intelligence agencies. Investigators, the officials said, have become increasingly confident, based on the evidence they have uncovered, that Russia\u2019s direct goal is not to support the election of Mr. Trump, as many Democrats have asserted, but rather to disrupt the integrity of the political system and undermine America\u2019s standing in the world more broadly.\nThe hacking, they said, reflected an intensification of spy-versus-spy operations that never entirely abated after the Cold War but that have become more aggressive in recent years as relations with Mr. Putin\u2019s Russia have soured.\nA senior intelligence official, who like the others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a continuing national security investigation, said the Russians had become adept at exploiting computer vulnerabilities created by the relative openness of and reliance on the internet. Election officials in several states have reported what appeared to be cyberintrusions from Russia, and while many doubt that an Election Day hack could alter the outcome of the election, the F.B.I. agencies across the government are on alert for potential disruptions that could wreak havoc with the voting process itself.\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t about the election,\u201d a second senior official said, referring to the aims of Russia\u2019s interference. \u201cIt\u2019s about a threat to democracy.\u201d\nThe investigation has treated it as a counterintelligence operation as much as a criminal one, though agents are also focusing on whether anyone in the United States was involved. The officials declined to discuss any individual targets of the investigation, even when assured of anonymity.\nAs has been the case with the investigation into Mrs. Clinton, the F.B.I. has come under intense partisan political pressure \u2014 something the bureau\u2019s leaders have long sought to avoid. Supporters of both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump have been equally impassioned in calling for investigations \u2014 and even in providing leads for investigators to follow.\nMr. Reid, in a letter to Mr. Comey in August, asserted that Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign \u201chas employed a number of individuals with significant and disturbing ties to the Russia and the Kremlin.\u201d Although Mr. Reid cited no evidence and offered no names explicitly, he clearly referred to one of Mr. Trump\u2019s earlier campaign advisers, Carter Page.\nMr. Page, a former Merrill Lynch banker who founded an investment company in New York, Global Energy Capital, drew attention during the summer for a speech in which he criticized the United States and other Western nations for a \u201chypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization, inequality, corruption and regime change\u201d in Russia and other parts of the former Soviet Union.\nMr. Page responded with his own letter to Mr. Comey, denying wrongdoing and calling Mr. Reid\u2019s accusations \u201ca witch hunt.\u201d In an interview, he said that he had never been contacted by the F.B.I. and that the accusations were baseless and purely partisan because of his policy views on Russia. \u201cThese people really seem to be grasping at straws,\u201d he said.\nDemocrats have also accused another Republican strategist and Trump confidant, Roger Stone, of being a conduit between the Russian hackers and WikiLeaks, which has published the emails of the Democratic National Committee and Mr. Podesta, the Clinton campaign manager. Mr. Stone boasted of having contacts with the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, and appeared to predict the hacking of Mr. Podesta\u2019s account, though he later denied having any prior knowledge.\nMr. Stone derided the accusations and those raised by Michael J. Morell, a former C.I.A. director and a Clinton supporter, who has called Mr. Trump \u201can unwitting agent of the Russian Federation.\u201d In an article on the conservative news site Breitbart, Mr. Stone denied having links to Russians and called the accusations \u201cthe new McCarthyism.\u201d", "date": "Oct. 31, 2016", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/us/politics/fbi-russia-election-donald-trump.html", "tags": "f.b.i officials sees investigation clear \u201d trump donald russia \u2014 investigating link"}
