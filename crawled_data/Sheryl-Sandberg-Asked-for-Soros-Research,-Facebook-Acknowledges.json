{"title": "Sheryl Sandberg Asked for Soros Research, Facebook Acknowledges", "content": "Sheryl Sandberg asked Facebook\u2019s communications staff to research George Soros\u2019s financial interests in the wake of his high-profile attacks on tech companies, according to three people with knowledge of her request, indicating that Facebook\u2019s second in command was directly involved in the social network\u2019s response to the liberal billionaire.\nMs. Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, asked for the information in an email to a senior executive in January that was forwarded to other senior communications and policy staff, the people said. The email came within days of a blistering speech Mr. Soros delivered that month at the World Economic Forum, attacking Facebook and Google as a \u201cmenace\u201d to society and calling for the companies to be regulated.\nMs. Sandberg \u2014 who was at the forum, but was not present for Mr. Soros\u2019s speech, according to a person who attended it \u2014 requested an examination into why Mr. Soros had criticized the tech companies and whether he stood to gain financially from the attacks. At the time, Facebook was under growing scrutiny for the role its platform had played in disseminating Russian propaganda and fomenting campaigns of hatred in Myanmar and other countries.\nFacebook later commissioned a campaign-style opposition research effort by Definers Public Affairs, a Republican-linked firm, which gathered and circulated to reporters public information about Mr. Soros\u2019s funding of American advocacy groups critical of Facebook.\nThose efforts, revealed this month in a New York Times investigation, set off a public relations debacle for Ms. Sandberg and for Facebook, which was accused of trafficking in anti-Semitic attacks against the billionaire. Facebook quickly fired Definers.\nThe people with knowledge of Ms. Sandberg\u2019s email asked for anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to discuss the message and feared retribution.\nIn a statement, Facebook said that the company had already begun researching Mr. Soros when Ms. Sandberg made her request.\n\u201cMr. Soros is a prominent investor and we looked into his investments and trading activity related to Facebook,\u201d the company said. \u201cThat research was already underway when Sheryl sent an email asking if Mr. Soros had shorted Facebook\u2019s stock.\u201d The company said that while Ms. Sandberg \u201ctakes full responsibility for any activity that happened on her watch,\u201d she did not personally direct any research on Freedom from Facebook, an anti-Facebook coalition whose members were among the subjects of Definers\u2019 later work.\nEddie Vale, a spokesman for Freedom from Facebook, said he was skeptical of the company\u2019s account.\n\u201cIn light of Sandberg\u2019s continuously changing story on the Soros research, there\u2019s no way their denials about attacking other critics can be taken at face value,\u201d Mr. Vale said. \u201cFacebook must immediately release any emails and any research about targeting the Freedom from Facebook coalition or any member organizations.\u201d\nThe revelation complicates Ms. Sandberg\u2019s shifting explanations of her role in Facebook\u2019s decisions to hire Definers and go on the offensive against the social network\u2019s growing legion of critics. Ms. Sandberg at first denied knowing that Facebook had hired Definers, before acknowledging in a post last week that some of the company\u2019s work for Facebook had crossed her desk.\nIn that post, Ms. Sandberg did not explicitly deny that she had asked for research into Mr. Soros. Instead, a deputy who oversaw the communications team but is now leaving the company, Elliot J. Schrage, took responsibility for hiring Definers and initiating Definers\u2019 investigation into Mr. Soros. It is unclear what, if any, involvement Ms. Sandberg had in that ultimate response to Mr. Soros.\n\u201cWe had not heard such criticism from him before and wanted to determine if he had any financial motivation,\u201d Mr. Schrage said of Mr. Soros. \u201cDefiners researched this using public information.\u201d\nFacebook has defended its inquiries into Mr. Soros as a prudent and necessary step for any public company under attack by a high-profile figure \u2014 particularly one like Mr. Soros, a onetime currency trader who made a fortune in the 1990s betting against the British pound.\nBut the revelations are likely to escalate pressure on Ms. Sandberg, an embattled Silicon Valley star and feminist author.\nThe Times investigation found that Ms. Sandberg and Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, had ignored warnings about abuse on the platform and sought to conceal from public view evidence that Russia had used it to disrupt the 2016 presidential campaign and help elect President Trump. The Times also found that when Facebook was confronted last spring with revelations that the privacy of tens of millions of users had been compromised by Cambridge Analytica, a Trump-linked data firm, Ms. Sandberg and Mr. Zuckerberg sought to downplay the problem and deflect blame.\nBut it is Ms. Sandberg who oversees Facebook\u2019s policy and communications arms, which starting last year embarked on a hard-edged lobbying campaign to discredit the company\u2019s critics and push back on the growing chorus of voices calling for Facebook and other big tech companies to be broken up or more tightly regulated.\nSome have called on Ms. Sandberg to be fired. Last week\u2019s admission by Mr. Schrage \u2014 a Sandberg confidante who announced in June that he was leaving the company \u2014 was widely viewed inside and outside the company as an effort to insulate her from damage.\nFacebook hired Definers last year to monitor media coverage and then expanded its role to include campaign-style research and other public relations work.\nIn a private meeting on Thursday, Ms. Sandberg again distanced herself from Definers and its research into Mr. Soros, according to Rashad Robinson, head of the racial-justice group Color of Change, which was named in a Definers memo about Mr. Soros.\nMr. Robinson said that while meeting with Ms. Sandberg, she denied hiring Definers or directing the firm\u2019s research.\n\u201cShe very much placed it on the now departed communications chief\u201d \u2014 Mr. Schrage \u2014 \u201cand also worked to assure us that Joel Kaplan had nothing to do with it either,\u201d Mr. Robinson said. Mr. Kaplan is the company\u2019s vice president of global public policy.\nMr. Robinson said he was pleased Ms. Sandberg had agreed to release a progress report on a previously announced internal audit into how Facebook\u2019s policies affected minority users and employees. But when he pushed for more on Facebook\u2019s involvement with Definers, Mr. Robinson said, Ms. Sandberg kept stressing that Facebook had fired the firm.\n\u201cWe were not satisfied with that answer,\u201d he said.", "date": "Nov. 29, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/technology/george-soros-facebook-sheryl-sandberg.html", "tags": "company sheryl \u201c facebook definers asked acknowledges soros sandberg ms. research"}
