{"title": "Georgia Gov- Brian Kemp Signs Anti-Abortion 'Heartbeat Bill'", "content": "Republican Gov. Brian Kemp signed Georgia\u2019s controversial \u201cheartbeat bill\u201d Tuesday morning, severely limiting access to abortion\u00a0for millions of women across the state.\nThe measure, authored by state Rep. Ed Setzler (R), bans abortion as soon as a doctor can detect a fetal heartbeat, which usually happens at around six weeks into a pregnancy \u2015 when many women are not yet aware of their condition. Kemp\u2019s signature overrides current state law that allows abortion up until 20 weeks and makes Georgia one of the most restrictive\u00a0states in the country for women seeking an abortion.\n\u201cI realize some may challenge it in the court of law,\u201d Kemp said shortly before signing the measure. \u201cBut our job is to do what is right, not what is easy.\u201d\nThe American Civil Liberties Union has already promised to fight the law. In a tweet immediately following Kemp\u2019s signature, the group stated: \u201cWe\u2019ve said it before and we\u2019ll say it again \u2014 we will see you in court.\u201d\nThe Center for Reproductive Rights has also pledged to sue the state. The group\u2019s chief counsel, Elisabeth Smith, called the law \u201cbafflingly unconstitutional.\u201d\u00a0\nSmith, in a statement, explained why activists regard the law as being, in effect, a total abortion ban:\nPlanned Parenthood also plans to sue. Staci Fox, president of Planned Parenthood Southeast Advocates, shared a message directed at Georgia lawmakers who supported the bill: \u201d[Y]our votes are far outside the mainstream and we will now spend our time and energy launching a campaign to replace you.\u201d\nKemp expressed his support for the bill as it moved through the Georgia General Assembly, proudly calling it the \u201ctoughest abortion bill in the country\u201d and vowing to fight back against the inevitable legal challenges.\n\u201cI have no ill will for people who oppose this, and I understand it,\u201d he told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\u00a0earlier this year. \u201cBut this is about protecting life, and we\u2019re willing to fight for it.\u201d\nAbortion rights advocates have rallied against the bill, with NARAL Georgia arguing that \u201cbecoming the state with the most restrictive abortion bans on the books, driving away doctors and further worsening our already dire health care crisis is bad for business and bad for Georgia.\u201d\u00a0\nThe Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit reproductive health care research group, said the legislation was \u201cpart of a deliberate strategy\u201d to challenge the landmark Supreme Court Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion \u201cin hopes that an increasingly conservative Court will undermine or even overturn Roe.\u201d\u00a0\nGeorgia state Sen. Jen Jordan (D) explained in a video posted by the Planned Parenthood Action Fund that the controversy \u201cisn\u2019t really about abortion,\u201d but rather \u201cabout women\u2019s fundamental rights.\u201d\n\u201cIf we criminalize doctors and we criminalize women, what we\u2019re going to see is more women die and more infants die,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cIf we really care about lives and mothers and children, then we need to invest in their health care.\u201d\nThe bill,\u00a0nicknamed the LIFE (Living Infants Fairness and Equality) Act, passed along a party-line vote in the state Senate, but faced tougher odds in the state House, where several GOP lawmakers voted against it or did not vote.\u00a0\nOpponents\u2019 concerns spread beyond Georgia. Bills marking a fetal heartbeat as a deadline for abortion have also been introduced this year in Tennessee and Mississippi.\u00a0Access Reproductive Care of the Southeast \u2015 Georgia\u2019s only abortion fund \u2015 issued a statement counting 10 states currently considering similar legislation.\u00a0\nStacey Abrams, whose failed 2018 campaign for Georgia governor prompted widespread criticism of Kemp over reports of voter supression, chimed in over Twitter.\n\u201cBad policies like the forced pregnancy bill are a direct result of voter suppression,\u201d Abrams, a Democrat, wrote. \u201cWe will fight back in court and at the voting booth.\u201d\nThis article has been updated to include comments from Abrams and Planned Parenthood.", "date": "\n05/07/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/georgia-heartbeat-abortion-bill-signed_n_5c9953eae4b0f7bfa1b576c5?bq", "tags": "brian \u201c gov- court signs kemp georgia abortion state bill women anti-abortion law"}
