{"title": "Mueller Rejects Flynn\u2019s Attempt to Portray Himself as Victim of the F.B.I.", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The special counsel\u2019s office rejected on Friday a suggestion from Michael T. Flynn, President Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, that he had been tricked into lying last year to F.B.I. agents investigating Russia\u2019s election interference and ties to Trump associates.\nProsecutors laid out a pattern of lies by Mr. Flynn to Vice President Mike Pence, senior White House aides, federal investigators and the news media in the weeks before and after the presidential inauguration as he scrambled to obscure the truth about his communications during the presidential transition with Sergey I. Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the United States at the time.\nNeither his lawyers nor Mr. Flynn, the former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, have explained why he lied to the F.B.I., a felony that he pleaded guilty to a year ago. But in a memo this week seeking leniency, his lawyers revealed details from the interview that stoked an unfounded theory that Mr. Flynn\u2019s demeanor during questioning indicated that he did not understand that he was being formally investigated. They also blamed the F.B.I. for not informing Mr. Flynn ahead of time that lying to agents is illegal \u2014 an argument that prosecutors repudiated.\n\u201cA sitting national security adviser, former head of an intelligence agency, retired lieutenant general and 33-year veteran of the armed forces knows he should not lie to federal agents,\u201d prosecutors for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, wrote in court papers. \u201cHe does not need to be warned it is a crime to lie to federal agents to know the importance of telling them the truth.\u201d\n[Read prosecutors\u2019 memo rejecting Michael Flynn\u2019s attempt to blame investigators for lying to them.]\nLeniency for Mr. Flynn had all but been assured after Mr. Mueller\u2019s prosecutors recommended last week that he receive little or no prison time, crediting his cooperation with their inquiry and other investigations as well as his lengthy military service. His decision to attack the F.B.I. in his own plea for probation appeared to be a gambit for a pardon from Mr. Trump, whose former lawyer had broached the prospect last year with a lawyer for Mr. Flynn.\nThe president seized on the case that Mr. Flynn made against the F.B.I. in his sentencing memo, defending him on Twitter and on Fox News. \u201cThey convinced him he did lie, and he made some kind of a deal,\u201d Mr. Trump said of investigators on Thursday during the television interview.\nThat contradicts the narrative that prosecutors have described in court papers. American intelligence had picked up Mr. Flynn\u2019s conversations on wiretaps of the ambassador as part of standard surveillance. So the F.B.I. agents had evidence that Mr. Flynn was lying when he denied asking Mr. Kislyak that Russia refrain from reacting harshly to sanctions imposed by the Obama administration over election interference. He also said he did not remember Mr. Kislyak telling him that Moscow had backed off as a result of Mr. Flynn\u2019s request.\nAnd prosecutors revealed on Friday how far investigators had gone during the interview to give Mr. Flynn the chance to tell the truth. At one point, the F.B.I. agents repeated portions of what he had said privately to Mr. Kislyak to jog Mr. Flynn\u2019s memory. \u201cBut the defendant never corrected his false statements,\u201d the prosecutors wrote.\nLawyers for Mr. Flynn have tried to minimize his lying to the F.B.I. as an \u201cuncharacteristic error in judgment.\u201d In their sentencing memo, they also seized on the spurious theory that Mr. Flynn\u2019s relaxed behavior was exculpatory.\n\u201cEven when circumstances later came to light that prompted extensive public debate about the investigation of General Flynn, including revelations that certain F.B.I. officials involved in the Jan. 24 interview of General Flynn were themselves being investigated for misconduct, General Flynn did not back away from accepting responsibility for his actions,\u201d his lawyers wrote.\nThe theory about his body language grew out of F.B.I. memos, court papers and revelations about the interview in which the agents have revealed that Mr. Flynn appeared \u201crelaxed and jocular\u201d when they arrived at the White House. He offered to give them a tour, and they discussed the hotels where Mr. Flynn had stayed during the campaign and the president\u2019s \u201cknack for interior design,\u201d according to court papers.\nOne agent said Mr. Flynn was \u201cunguarded\u201d and \u201cclearly saw the F.B.I. agents as allies,\u201d and he readily answered questions, F.B.I. documents showed. Mr. Flynn had a very \u201csure demeanor\u201d during the interview, according to the senior counterintelligence agent who interviewed him, Peter Strzok, who said he saw no \u201cindicators of deception.\u201d\nBut prosecutors explained his confidence not as evidence of truth-telling but as a result of the numerous dishonest accounts he had already given about his conversations with Mr. Kislyak. \u201cBy the time of the F.B.I. interview,\u201d they wrote, \u201cthe defendant was committed to his false story.\u201d\nJames B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director fired by Mr. Trump, testified last week before Congress that the theory being pushed by allies of Mr. Flynn about his body language was bogus. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt he was lying,\u201d Mr. Comey said.\nIndeed, law enforcement officials grew so concerned about Mr. Flynn\u2019s contacts with Mr. Kislyak and his false explanations for them that they warned the White House that he might be compromised by the Kremlin.\nMr. Strzok viewed Mr. Flynn as \u201cbright but not profoundly sophisticated,\u201d according to court papers. Mr. Strzok, who disparaged Mr. Trump in critical text messages and was fired this year for violating bureau policies, has been a frequent target in Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on law enforcement.\nMr. Flynn\u2019s disclosures this week about his F.B.I. interview also called into question why he waited until just before his sentencing on Tuesday to argue that he was coerced into lying. In pleading guilty last year, he said, \u201cI recognize that the actions I acknowledged in court today were wrong.\u201d\nThe move also prompted a quick response from the judge presiding over the case, Emmet G. Sullivan of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. He ordered that lawyers and prosecutors turn over documents related to Mr. Flynn\u2019s Jan. 24, 2017, interview and could question Mr. Flynn during his sentencing about why he decided to revisit the circumstances of it nearly a year after pleading guilty.\nJudge Sullivan is wary of prosecutorial misconduct. In 2009, he dismissed the ethics conviction of former Senator Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska, and scolded prosecutors, who had withdrawn the charges, for improperly withholding evidence. He took the rare step of appointing a special prosecutor to investigate whether the prosecutors themselves should be charged.\nMr. Flynn\u2019s calls to Mr. Kislyak, during which he made assurances about the incoming administration, were part of a broader effort by senior Trump officials to create foreign policy before they were in power, and they alarmed F.B.I. investigators who were already scrutinizing Mr. Flynn as part of the Russia inquiry.\nProsecutors also reminded the judge that Mr. Flynn had made false statements in trying to conceal lobbying work he had done on behalf of Turkey. The Turkish government had paid Mr. Flynn more than $500,000 to investigate Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish cleric who lives in Pennsylvania. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey believes that Mr. Gulen and his supporters were behind a failed coup attempt in 2016 and has repeatedly demanded the United States extradite him.\n\u201cThe defendant made those false statements while represented by counsel and after receiving an explicit warning that providing false information was a federal offense,\u201d the prosecutors wrote.", "date": "Dec. 14, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/14/us/politics/michael-flynn-fbi-donald-trump.html", "tags": "portray victim prosecutors f.b.i \u201d interview lying flynn attempt rejects agents mueller"}
