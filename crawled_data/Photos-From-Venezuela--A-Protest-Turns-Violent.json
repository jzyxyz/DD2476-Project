{"title": "Photos From Venezuela: A Protest Turns Violent", "content": "Protesters intent on driving out Venezuela\u2019s embattled president took back to the streets on Tuesday, calling upon soldiers to join them in a national uprising.\nThe demonstrations in Caracas, the capital, soon turned violent, as protesters and law enforcement officers loyal to President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro clashed.\nTensions began building after the Venezuelan opposition leader, Juan Guaid\u00f3, stepped up his campaign to oust Mr. Maduro.\nMr. Guaid\u00f3, who declared himself interim president in January, showed up at a military base in the capital and, accompanied by a few soldiers, declared that \u201cthe definitive end of the usurpation starts today.\u201d\nBut in the early hours of the uprising attempt, at least, the authoritarian president still seemed to have a grip on power.\nHere are some photos from the scene of the protests on Tuesday.\nWhile Mr. Guaid\u00f3 did appear to have the support of at least some members of the military, others clearly remained on the side of the president. They clashed with protesters and fellow military members alike.\nMr. Maduro took to Twitter to declare that the military was on his side. Commanders, he said, had assured him of \u201ctheir total loyalty to the people, to the Constitution and to the fatherland.\u201d\nA government spokesman dismissed the \u201csmall group of military traitors\u201d who had thrown their lot in with Mr. Guaid\u00f3, and accused them of trying to stage a coup.\nMr. Guaid\u00f3 has had the backing of the Trump administration since he set out to topple the Maduro government. He says he wants the country to hold free elections.\nOn Tuesday, Trump officials restated their support for the opposition leader, offering a chorus of praise for him on Twitter and at a news briefing.\nBut in the months since Mr. Guaid\u00f3 has staked his claim to power, he has gained little ground.\n\u201cI believe this is very important, but I see apathy and fear in people,\u201d one protester said.", "date": "April 30, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/30/world/americas/venezuela-photos.html", "tags": "guaid\u00f3 protest military maduro took venezuela protesters \u201d violent turns tuesday photos"}
