They\u2019ve all worked for their dads, who were rich. And they all inherited (or will inherit) vast family fortunes.\u201d\nMaher explained how Trump and Mnuchin had wanted to slash corporate tax rates from 35 percent to 15 percent, \u201ceven though most Americans \u2014 six out of ten\u00a0\u2014 think corporations already pay too little.\u201d\nThe comedian also noted that Trump was cheered at a recent rally in Phoenix, for telling the \u201csea of white faces, stretch pants and plastic shoes\u201d that \u201cthe economy was rigged.\u201d\nFor Maher, however, the problem remains that \u201cthe only prescription Trump has for unrigging the economy is tax cuts\u201d that will \u201calmost exclusively benefit the people who are doing the rigging.\u201d\n\u201cMost of the people in Trump\u2019s audience don\u2019t make enough to pay income tax at all, don\u2019t own corporations,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd the closest they\u2019ve ever been to an estate was when they visited Graceland.\u201d\nCheck out Maher\u2019s full blog post here.", "date": "\n09/20/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bill-maher-donald-trump-tax-reform_n_59c22236e4b087fdf5091f46", "tags": "know maher right- tax recent blog \u201d trump donald asks conned bill \u2014 supporters-"}
