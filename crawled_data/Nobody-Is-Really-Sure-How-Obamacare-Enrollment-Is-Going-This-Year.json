{"title": "Nobody Is Really Sure How Obamacare Enrollment Is Going This Year", "content": "TAMPA, Florida \u2015 The Affordable Care Act clearly isn\u2019t \u201cdead,\u201d as President Donald Trump declared a month ago.\nBut despite some surprisingly large sign-up numbers for the first two weeks of open enrollment, it\u2019s way too early to tell just how big a toll Trump\u2019s war on the program has taken \u2015 or how many people will end up with insurance by Dec. 15, the deadline for obtaining 2018 coverage.\nThat\u2019s what you\u2019ll hear from most experts who follow the issue closely. It\u2019s also what you\u2019ll hear from people like Jodi Ray, who is the project director for Florida Covering Kids and Families, a nonprofit that has spearheaded state efforts to get residents health insurance under \u201cObamacare.\u201d\nRay has been there since the program\u2019s beginning, going back to late 2013, when the website didn\u2019t work, and when a combination of plan cancellations and sudden rate hikes sparked an uproar. For a while, it looked like the whole system might just fall apart. It didn\u2019t, of course, and Florida would go on to have some of the largest signup numbers of any state in the country.\nThis year, Ray says, interest in plans seems even stronger.\u00a0\nShe says she\u2019s seen it at her office and at walk-in enrollment events, like one at the University of South Florida on Wednesday, where a group of \u201cnavigators\u201d (the Affordable Care Act\u2019s official enrollment advisors) kept busy with a steady stream of consumers all morning long.\u00a0\nRay has heard similar accounts from her contacts around the state \u2015 including enrollment counselors in the small, rural counties that are traditionally the hardest for organizations like hers to reach. \u201cThey said this year, they have been busier than they have ever been, which astonishes me.\u201d\nThe numbers tell a similar story. Through the first two weeks, 1.5 million people signed up for private insurance through HealthCare.gov, the Department of Health and Human Services reported on Wednesday. That\u2019s roughly 50 percent more than last year\u2019s sign-ups after two weeks.\nStates that run their own online marketplaces, such as California and Minnesota, are reporting similar surges.\u00a0Charles Gaba, the analyst who runs ACAsignups.net, says that he expects sign-ups on HealthCare.gov to pass 2 million over the weekend, with enrollments from state-run marketplaces bringing the national total to around 4 million.\nBut \u201cnobody is calling trends yet,\u201d Ray warns, and it\u2019s easy to see why she is wary. In the past, open enrollment has extended into January. With the much shorter period, accelerated sign-ups are necessary just to hit last year\u2019s mark.\nMeanwhile, organizations like hers are operating with fewer financial resources, because the Trump administration decided to slash federal support. \u00a0(Florida\u2019s Covering Kids took a cut of about $900,000, out of a total $5.8 million budget, according to Ray.) Nor can they can count on the usual barrage of national advertising to promote enrollment, because the Trump administration pulled way back on that spending, too.\nThe scaled-back outreach seems especially troubling because Republican efforts to repeal the program appear to have created a great deal of confusion over its status. \u201cWe\u2019ve got people calling us and saying they stopped paying their premiums, because they thought it was all gone,\u201d Ray said.\nStill, the Affordable Care Act has proven surprisingly resilient in the past -\u2013 and it may be doing so again, sometimes for reasons that are surprising a lot of experts. A case in point is the way Trump\u2019s most well-publicized effort at sabotage has played out.\nIn October, Trump finally carried out his threat to stop a set of vital payments to insurance companies. By that time, several insurers had already left the market, in no small part because they feared such a move was coming. Those that remained jacked up their premiums. But in most states they did so in a way that shielded some or all of their customers \u2015 and, for a variety of complicated reasons, it means that lower-income consumers are actually getting even more assistance than they would have otherwise.\nIt\u2019s a clumsy solution that hasn\u2019t worked for everybody. The number of upper-middle-class consumers facing high, sometimes unaffordable premiums is going up. And it was already pretty high, for reasons that have as much to do with the program\u2019s design as anything the Trump administration did.\nBut people who make a little less money, and thus qualify for the law\u2019s financial assistance, are generally getting a better deal this year. Either they can spend the same amount of money and get a better plan, or they can keep the same plan and just spend less on it.\nOnline brokers, like HealthSherpa, have noticed a shift \u2015 with average lower premiums coming down and interest in \u201cgold\u201d plans, the more generous alternative to traditional \u201csilver\u201d plans, ticking up. And although its sample is not necessarily representative of the whole, officials at Covered California, that state\u2019s marketplace, reported last week they are seeing the same two trends among their consumers.\nStrange as it may sound, all the turmoil may be helping too \u2015 or, at least, having more of a mixed effect than everybody was expecting as recently as last month. At another open enrollment on Wednesday, sponsored by the Health Council of South Florida and held in northwest Miami, Jesse Miro, one of the Health Council\u2019s navigators, told HuffPost that confusion over news reports may be prompting more people to ask questions \u2015 and, ultimately, to check out their coverage options online, where they are discovering the deep discounts.\nLike Ray, Miro said he\u2019s heard of people dropping coverage because they thought the program had ended. But now he\u2019s wondering if the prospect of repeal is having the opposite effect on at least some consumers \u2015 prodding them to sign up, or at least investigate their options, because they think that once they have some insurance it will be easier to hold onto it. \u201cSome seem to think that if they get in now, they\u2019ll get locked in \u2015 end up grandfathered somehow.\u201d\nStill, the people who work in outreach say that, with less publicity and less funding from Washington, they will have less capacity to help people who are hardest to reach, or whose circumstances are the most complicated.\n\u201cI have a woman, she and her kids were all uninsured \u2015 one college aged, one high school, she\u2019s a waitress in a restaurant,\u201d Ray said on Wednesday, describing a family with a particularly complex income situation. \u201cWe enrolled them yesterday, for first time in years. All she could talk about is scheduling her first appointment for a checkup. She was ecstatic. But analyzing health insurance for her was very involved.\u201d", "date": "\n11/19/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/obamacare-enrollment-health-care-insurance_n_5a0e82cae4b0dd63b1a98cb1", "tags": "going sure ray really obamacare nobody \u201d \u2015 year florida like insurance enrollment"}
