{"title": "Donald Trump- I Was 'Never A Fan Of John McCain And Never Will Be'", "content": "President Donald Trump on Tuesday continued to bash the late Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), telling reporters at the Oval Office that he was \u201cnever a fan.\u201d\nAsked why he attacked McCain, who died nearly seven months ago, in a series of weekend tweets, the president said he\u2019s \u201cvery unhappy\u201d that the lawmaker was a key vote against a GOP bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act in July 2017.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s disgraceful,\u201d Trump told reporters ahead of a joint press conference with far-right Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.\u00a0\u201cPlus, there are other things. I was never a fan of John McCain and never will be.\u201d\nTrump and McCain, who died in August 2018 after a more than yearlong fight with brain cancer, frequently butted heads during Trump\u2019s presidency and campaign for office.\u00a0Trump, who avoided military service as a young man, infamously mocked the decorated Navy veteran for having been held as a prisoner of war for more than five years during the Vietnam War.\u00a0\nIn a flurry of tweets on Saturday and Sunday, Trump reignited attacks on McCain. He called out the late senator\u2019s academic record when he was a student years ago at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, and falsely claimed there was evidence that he had provided the infamous Steele dossier, which alleges Russian blackmail on the president, to the media.\nTrump on Saturday quoted Ken Starr, the former independent counsel whose investigation resulted in the impeachment of President Bill Clinton, as calling the Russian dossier \u201ca very dark stain\u201d against McCain.\nMeghan McCain,\u00a0co-host of ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View\u201d and one of the late senator\u2019s children, torched Trump for the remarks on Twitter.\n\u201cNo one will ever love you the way they loved my father,\u201d she tweeted on Saturday. \u201cI wish I had been given more [Saturdays] with him. Maybe spend yours with your family instead of on twitter obsessing over mine?\u201d", "date": "\n03/19/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-john-mccain-oval-office_n_5c91255de4b071a25a878e52", "tags": "trump- \u201c reporters never donald late fan mccain john saturday"}
