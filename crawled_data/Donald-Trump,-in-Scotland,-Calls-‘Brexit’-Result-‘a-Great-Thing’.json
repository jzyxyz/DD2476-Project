Trump arrived in Scotland just as Britain was deciding to leave the European Union and proclaimed the momentous departure \u201ca great thing\u201d and the subsequent decline of the British pound good for local companies \u2014 including his own Turnberry golf course.\nTouching down in Scotland on Friday morning to visit his luxury resort and golf course, Mr. Trump, who before the vote had suggested that Britain leave the European Union, took a victory lap of sorts, landing in his \u201cG-TRMP\u201d helicopter and proclaiming, \u201cI said this was going to happen, and I think that it\u2019s a great thing.\u201d\n\u201cBasically they took back their country,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\nAnd amid global jitters over Britain\u2019s divorce from the European Union, Mr. Trump reacted with celebration and self-interest, predicting that it would benefit his business and declaring that President Obama contributed to the outcome.\n\u201cLook, if the pound goes down, they\u2019re going to do more business,\u201d Mr. Trump said, when asked during a news conference about the referendum\u2019s market ramifications. \u201cWhen the pound goes down, more people are coming to Turnberry, frankly.\u201d\nMr. Trump also said he saw \u201ca big parallel\u201d between the vote in Britain and the broader populist, anti-establishment sentiment that helped fuel his rise to the status of presumptive Republican presidential nominee.\n\u201cPeople want to take their country back, they want to have independence in a sense, and you see it with Europe, all over Europe, and you\u2019re going to have more than just, in my opinion, more than just what happened last night,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have many other cases where people want to take their borders back, they want to take their monetary back, they want to take a lot of things back, they want to be able to have a country again.\u201d\nHis message in favor of \u201cBrexit\u201d was not necessarily welcome here in Scotland, whose citizens had overwhelmingly voted to remain part of Europe and were already discussing the possibility of breaking from England as a result of Thursday\u2019s vote.\nEarly in June, Mr. Trump did not even know what Brexit referred to, and as recently as Wednesday, he said that his opinion on the referendum was insignificant because he had not been following the issue closely.\nBut hours after Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain announced that he was going to resign as a result of the vote, Mr. Trump offered his own political analysis, saying frustration with the status quo had helped influence the result.\n\u201cPeople are angry, all over the world people, they\u2019re angry,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re angry over borders, they\u2019re angry over people coming into the country and taking over, nobody even knows who they are. They\u2019re angry about many, many things.\u201d\nMr. Trump\u2019s trip came at an unusual moment \u2014 just a month before the Republican National Convention, and as many of his aides privately fretted about the timing of the visit as he seeks to unite the party behind him. He arrived after a tough week in the United States \u2014 the firing of his campaign manager and the revelation that his campaign has stunningly little cash on hand \u2014 and the bucolic backdrop belied the turmoil roiling Europe, the markets and even his own political operation.\nAt the news conference, he was pressed repeatedly on the British referendum, and at several points he blamed Mr. Obama, who had urged Britain not to split from the European Union. \u201cIt\u2019s not his country, it\u2019s not his part of the world, he shouldn\u2019t have done it, and I actually think that his recommendation perhaps caused it to fail,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\nHe also attacked Hillary Clinton, saying she had \u201cmisread\u201d the mood of the country \u2014 violating a tacit rule of decorum that politics stop at the water\u2019s edge.\nStill, Mr. Trump\u2019s visit at times had the feel of an American abroad promoting his moneyed golf links, rather than his own candidacy for president. He was greeted, much like the queen of England would be met, by staff members of Trump Turnberry \u2014 all clad in red \u201cMake Turnberry Great Again\u201d hats \u2014 as well as bagpipers who, along with Secret Service agents, preceded him up the sloping steps to his property. And he waxed proud about his golf resort for more than 15 minutes, before finally taking questions on the seismic news of the day.\nAt one point, Mr. Trump even compared his renovation of Trump Turnberry to how he is hoping to overhaul the United States. When a reporter pointed out \u2014 correctly \u2014 that a country is hardly a golf course, Mr. Trump replied: \u201cNo it\u2019s not, but you\u2019ll be amazed how similar it is. It\u2019s a place that has to be fixed.\u201d\nOther candidates have made such trips abroad to burnish their foreign policy credentials and elevate themselves as a statesman in the eyes of voters back home, jamming their days with high-level meetings with dignitaries.\nBut not Mr. Trump, whose business interests have long prescribed his political ones.  Despite landing the day after the referendum, his itinerary consisted simply of 48 hours spread across two of his golf courses \u2014 one on Scotland\u2019s southwest coast on Friday, the other in Balmedie on Saturday, overlooking the chilly North Sea. (Asked if he had huddled with his foreign policy advisers about \u201cBrexit,\u201d he replied, \u201cI\u2019ve been in touch with them but there\u2019s nothing to talk about.\u201d)\nYet even across the ocean, Mr. Trump was unable to escape the news of the campaign trail. A group of Scottish communities and leaders organized a phone call Friday to discuss their opposition to Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy.\nMr. Trump, who nonetheless received a fairly warm welcome in Scotland, where locals say they appreciate the money he has poured into the village economy since buying the golf course in 2014, is unlikely to be greeted as cheerfully when he visits Balmedie, north of Aberdeen.\nThere, his course, Trump International Golf Links, has been rived with controversy, with Mr. Trump trying to push locals out of their homes, promising jobs that never materialized, fighting over an offshore wind farm and even suing the Scottish government. Mr. Trump, whose comments about Mexicans and Hispanics have enraged many, including members of his own party, is expected to be met with a giant Mexican flag flying in view of his clubhouse \u2014 an act of protest by two local men.\nFrank Cruickshanks, 52, who is a caddy at Mr. Trump\u2019s property, including for Mr. Trump\u2019s son Eric, said he appreciated the work Mr. Trump had put into overhauling the golf course.\n\u201cHaving caddied for the last three weeks, mostly for Americans, I have yet to meet one who\u2019s voting for Hillary Clinton,\u201d Mr. Cruickshanks said.\nAsked if those American tourists were voting, then, for Mr. Trump, Mr. Cruickshanks paused. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t say that,\u201d he said, with a mischievous grin.", "date": "June 24, 2016", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/25/us/politics/donald-trump-scotland.html", "tags": "brexit country \u2018 scotland calls mr. golf great thing \u201d trump britain donald result \u2014"}
