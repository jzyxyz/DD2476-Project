{"title": "Argentina Turns to I.M.F., Long Its Villain, as Its Peso Plummets", "content": "BUENOS AIRES \u2014 Argentina has begun negotiating for a line of credit with the International Monetary Fund, turning to the very organization that much of the country still blames for an economic implosion and debt default 17 years ago.\nPresident Mauricio Macri announced the negotiations on Tuesday, just days after the country\u2019s central bank increased the benchmark interest rate to 40 percent and the government vowed a tighter fiscal policy in a bid to stabilize the country\u2019s tumbling currency, the peso. Foreign investors have fled as the peso\u2019s drop in value has accelerated, only increasing the pressure on the economy.\nChristine Lagarde, the I.M.F. managing director, said in a statement that discussions were underway and that ways to strengthen Argentina\u2019s economy would \u201cbe pursued in short order.\u201d\nEven though the announcement helped pare some losses on Tuesday, the peso depreciated almost 3 percent and the local stock market dropped almost 4 percent. Over all, the peso is down nearly 19 percent since the start of the year.\nMr. Macri, president since December 2015, portrayed the request as the product of changing international conditions and the legacy of high government spending.\n\u201cThe problem we have is that we are among the countries in the world that most depend on external financing, the product of the huge public spending that we inherited,\u201d he said in a recorded video message.\nTreasury Minister Nicol\u00e1s Dujovne emphasized that the financing the country could obtain through the I.M.F. would be cheaper than what was available in the markets. Yet he also gave a thinly veiled nod to the widespread skepticism \u2014 if not outright anger \u2014 that many in Argentina have toward the I.M.F.\n\u201cWhat we do have to keep in mind is that we are talking about an International Monetary Fund that is very different from what we knew 20 years ago,\u201d Mr. Dujovne said. \u201cThe fund has learned its lessons from the past, just like we all did.\u201d\nIn a seminal 2004 report, the I.M.F. recognized that it had made mistakes in dealing with Argentina before the 2001 debt crisis, including allowing the country\u2019s debt to balloon out of control by supporting an exchange rate policy that pegged the value of the peso to the dollar.\n\u201cThe I.M.F. is a bad word in Argentina because of the memories it brings to mind of economic programs that almost never turned out well,\u201d said Matias Carugati, chief economist at Management & Fit, a consultancy.\nWhen President N\u00e9stor Kirchner paid off an I.M.F. debt of almost $10 billion in 2006, he celebrated it as a way for the country to regain its sovereignty.\n\u201cWith this payment, we are interring a significant part of an ignominious past,\u201d Mr. Kirchner, who would die in 2010, said at the time.\nMr. Macri took office with an ambitious plan to end a decade of isolation from the international markets by issuing billions in debt. Now, the decision to turn to the I.M.F. could erode Argentines\u2019 confidence in him, said Luis Tonelli, a professor of comparative politics at the University of Buenos Aires.\nMerely seeking the help of the I.M.F. could lead the public to feel that \u201cthe government is weak and has to call the bad guy in the movie,\u201d Mr. Tonelli said.\nMembers of the political opposition were quick to criticize Mr. Macri.\n\u201cThe only idea that Macri came up with is to go to the lender of last resort. That is the I.M.F.,\u201d Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez, who served as the head of Mr. Kirchner\u2019s cabinet, wrote on Twitter.\nFront for Victory, the largest opposition bloc in the lower house of the National Congress of Argentina, called the decision \u201ca severe step backward.\u201d\n\u201cAgreements with the I.M.F. have always been prejudicial to our people,\u201d the group said. \u201cThey have meant cuts in salaries, pensions, privatizations and firings in the public sector and increases in poverty.\u201d\nEconomists cautioned that more information was needed in order to properly analyze the type of credit the government could obtain from the I.M.F. and the conditions that would be imposed as a result.\n\u201cIt is news that should bring a bit of relief to the market,\u201d said Luis Secco, the director of Perspectivas Econ\u00f3micas, a consultancy. \u201cBut it\u2019s undeniable that the words \u2018agreement with the fund\u2019 will also cause a lot of political problems for the government.\u201d", "date": "May 8, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/business/argentina-imf-peso.html", "tags": "debt i.m.f. country mr. macri peso \u201d plummets turns long villain i.m.f government argentina"}
