{"title": "'Game Of Thrones' Just Killed Off Your New Favorite Character", "content": "Tuesday was a sad day for \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d fans as HBO decided to edit out the coffee cup seen round Westeros \u2014 also known as Daenerys\u2019 Season 8, Episode 4 comrade \u2014 Ser Latte.\nMade from the same giant\u2019s milk that gave us Tormund Giantsbane (or was it almond milk?), Ser Latte spent countless nights by Dany\u2019s side, helping her get through the day and giving our queen the boost she needed. Sometimes, she got it hot, like fire \u2014 but other times, of course, there was iced. Still, no matter the temperature, Ser Latte was a key player in the Game of Scones.\nNow, the Night King has succeeded in erasing the beloved to-go cup from our memories.\nSo cheers to you, Ser Latte, for getting Dany through the long nights, as well as those post-battle hangovers. There\u2019s never bean a tall (or was it grande?) latte like you. We\u2019re only sorry that you never got to make it to pumpkin spice season. At least we had winter (cups).\nYour house words \u2014 \u201cMay I take your order?\u201d \u2014 will always be with us.\nChai simply can\u2019t believe it.\u00a0", "date": "\n05/07/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/game-of-thrones-latte_n_5cd1a4f9e4b0e4d75738e5f7", "tags": "ser game latte milk cup new favorite season killed thrones character day \u2014"}
