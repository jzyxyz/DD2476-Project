{"title": "Emilia Clarke Says \u2018Game Of Thrones\u2019 Season 8 Is Like \u2018Meet The Parents\u2019", "content": "Emilia Clarke has offered a tiny glimpse into the eighth and final season of \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d\nBased on the actress\u2019 comments to\u00a0Entertainment Weekly, her character Daenerys \u201cBend-the-Knee\u201d Targaryen really, really wants the Starks \u2014 the family of her lover Jon Snow (Kit Harington) \u2014 to like her when she arrives at Winterfell next season.\nThat\u2019s despite expecting Jon\u2019s last living relatives \u2014 who include Sansa (Sophie Turner), Arya (Maisie Williams) and Bran (Isaac Hempstead Wright) \u2014 to indiscriminately accept her as their new queen. And, ya know, incest.\n\u201cI like to think that it\u2019s like \u2018Meet the Parents,\u2019\u201d Clarke told ET Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s like: \u2018I hope they like me. This dude\u2019s wicked. It\u2019s a real good thing we got going on. He\u2019s the final piece. We\u2019re destined for greatness and world domination is a breath away.\u2019 And so I need to be like: \u2018Can I braid your hair, Sansa? Little Arya, come over here, let\u2019s play some cricket.\u2019 So there\u2019s that. And then, very, very quickly, it\u2019s like: \u2018Wait, is it just me, or do they hate me?\u2019\u201d\nDany\u2019s arrival at Winterfell will kick off the first episode of the next season, according to ET, and an icy reception from the Starks seems likely.\nSansa and Jon both fought tirelessly to reclaim their ancestral home of Winterfell and their region, which resulted in Jon being named the King of the North and Sansa the Lady of Winterfell. The Starks and the Northerners will likely be wary of Jon\u2019s decision to bend the knee to a foreign queen who hails from a family with a brutal reputation.\nJon, however, sees his alliance with Dany (who has a huge army and, well, dragons) as a necessary one if the living have any hope of surviving when the Army of the Dead descends on Winterfell.\nPlus, he kinda digs her.\nIt also seems likely that Jon will learn about his true lineage as soon as he comes home to Winterfell. In Season 7, it was revealed through Gilly\u2019s discovery Samwell Tarly\u2019s (John Bradley) research and Bran\u2019s powers as the Three-Eyed Raven that Jon is not actually the bastard son of Ned Stark, but the legitimate son of Ned\u2019s sister Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen. Rhaegar is Dany\u2019s brother, which makes her Jon\u2019s aunt.\nAnd although incestuous relationships aren\u2019t unheard of in \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d the revelation does make Jon \u201cheir to the Iron Throne\u201d and not Dany \u2014 which could result in some friction in their budding relationship, considering Dany may have a serious identity crisis.\nBut this is all speculation \u2014 because honestly, we truly know nothing until Season 8 premieres this Sunday.", "date": "\n04/08/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/emilia-clarke-game-of-thrones-season-8_n_5cab7d6de4b01b345039fa87", "tags": "\u2018 game clarke parents season \u201d meet emilia sansa jon says winterfell thrones like dany \u2014"}
