{"title": "\u2018It\u2019s Unnatural? Absolutely.\u2019", "content": "Looking back on his life and career in \u201cThe Glass of Fashion\u201d in 1954, Cecil Beaton, the society photographer and social fixture, reported a curious incident sometime in the 1930s. \u201cHearty naval commanders or jolly colonels,\u201d he wrote, \u201cacquired the \u2018camp\u2019 manners of calling everything from Joan of Arc to Merlin \u2018lots of fun,\u2019 and the adjective \u2018terrible\u2019 peppered into every sentence.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t terrible, but it was camp. Camp, in this sense, is not a pup tent, but a circus tent: not an activity, but a way to see, a gimlet-eyed but eyebrow-cocked gloss on the world. To the connoisseur of camp, the world is a stage, artifice trumps art, and exaggeration rarely goes far enough. \nIt is, in the words of the critic Susan Sontag, whose 1964 \u201cNotes on Camp\u201d became its codex and its decoder ring (and in so doing, made its author\u2019s reputation), \u201ca vision of the world in terms of style.\u201d Camp, she wrote, \u201csees everything in quotation marks\u201d; it \u201cconverts the serious into the frivolous.\u201d It is a feint and a frolic. It\u2019s \u201cterrible,\u201d with a giggle. (\u201cYou\u2019re terrible, Muriel!\u201d)\nSontag did not invent camp. The word has been recorded since the very beginning of the 20th century, and the concept has likely been with us much longer, but she brought what had been an esoteric, private code, used largely by and among gay men, into the open air. (From the Oxford English Dictionary\u2019s first documented use of \u201ccamp,\u201d in a 1909 dictionary of Victorian slang: \u201cUsed chiefly by persons of exceptional want of character.\u201d)\nHaving been brought into the open, camp has coursed into general use, and what was marginal has gone mainstream. Camp has inflected art, fashion, film, TV and design, even if what does and doesn\u2019t qualify remains a subject of furious debate. \nIn 1968, Esther Newton wrote of her study of drag queens that \u201cthis ethnography is a map of terra incognita as far as most middle class social scientists are concerned\u201d; now RuPaul is not only in vogue, but in Vogue.\nNext week \u201cCamp: Notes on Fashion\u201d will open at the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, with its famous celebrity-stuffed gala as ribbon cutting. As it does, it\u2019s fair to wonder: Is camp still \u201clots of fun\u201d when everyone\u2019s on board, aboveboard? The \u201cfugitive sensibility\u201d Sontag hoped to capture is now enshrined in the museum. \nSo, whither camp? And are we any closer to agreeing on what it is? On the occasion of the new exhibition, The New York Times invited six individuals whose work or study has touched camp or been touched by it, to discuss.\nJames Bidgood, 86, is a photographer and filmmaker whose work \u2014 from early phantasmagoric beefcake photography to \u201cPink Narcissus,\u201d an erotic film anonymously released in 1971 \u2014 is the subject of \u201cJames Bidgood: Reveries,\u201d a retrospective running through Sept. 8 at the Museum of Sex.\nCharles Busch, 64, is an actor, playwright and cabaret performer, often in drag. His credits include \u201cVampire Lesbians of Sodom\u201d (Off Broadway) and \u201cThe Tale of the Allergist\u2019s Wife\u201d (Broadway). His play \u201cThe Confession of Lily Dare\u201d comes to Primary Stages in January.\nJack Halberstam, 57, is a professor in the department of English and comparative literature and the Institute for Research on Women, Gender and Sexuality at Columbia University. Dr. Halberstam is the author of \u201cFemale Masculinity,\u201d \u201cGaga Feminism\u201d and \u201cTrans*: A Quick and Quirky Account of Gender Variability.\u201d\nParker Kit Hill, 23, is a dancer, performer and model. His short videos attracted an audience of one million on the mobile platform Vine. He now works, as himself and in character as \u201cParklynn,\u201d primarily on Instagram.\nCarmelita Tropicana, 68, the alter ego of the Cuban-American performance artist Alina Troyano, is a veteran of the New York alternative theater scene and the subject of the short film \u201cCarmelita Tropicana: Your Kunst Is Your Waffen\u201d by Ela Troyano.\nZaldy, 52, a fashion and costume designer who has created tour outfits for Lady Gaga, Katy Perry and Michael Jackson, is best known for his long collaboration with RuPaul and \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race,\u201d for which he has won two Emmy Awards.\nWe\u2019ve all come here today to discuss the most important, most frivolous topic: What is camp? I\u2019m interested to know if camp is something that has, in fact, inflected your work, and if it has changed from the way it used to be discussed in the \u201950s and \u201960s.\nJames: When he talks about the past, he looks at me.\nCharles: I\u2019m just so relieved. I thought that I was the oldest one here, but then I saw you and, thought, \u201cOh, thank God.\u201d\nJack: I was rereading the Sontag essay in preparation for this, and I do think that camp is a sensibility, an aesthetic sensibility. I would imagine it really derived from gay culture, gay male culture initially, and then has widened through every different group. Sontag starts with Oscar Wilde, which is a reasonable place to start because he was such a funny commentator on the unnatural. \nAt the time, people wouldn\u2019t have necessarily expressed their antipathy to same-sex sexuality through what we call homophobia, but they would have said, \u201cThis is unnatural.\u201d And so, you could say that one of the foundational gestures of camp is to say, \u201cIt\u2019s unnatural? Absolutely.\u201d\nZaldy: The term was in black and white in the dictionary in the last century, but camp and its queer roots have been there as far back as it goes. It\u2019s just \u2026 camp. I mean, imagine Roman orgies \u2014 that\u2019s camp! That is full-on camp.\nCharles: If we were back at the Roman orgy, it\u2019d be our perception of it as opposed to somebody else\u2019s. Maybe a heterosexual person at the Roman orgy might just be going at it from purely the sex angle, but if we were there, we\u2019d be amused at the look of it, or the person who\u2019s posing and looks foolish because they want to be something that they actually are not. I think an element of camp is what the truth is and what the perception is, when they\u2019re two different things. That\u2019s where often the humor comes in.\nCarmelita: I also think that it\u2019s really important to put women in. I came from the \u201980s, but women were also dressing up and were also acting out in cabaret around that time. Maybe they were not as visible.\nJames: I think they\u2019re all stretching it all too far. It\u2019s just a word that meant exaggerated, too much for the occasion. Susan Sontag did so much writing about nothing, she made a big patootie about something that was a minimal thing and that really defies definition.\nCarmelita: Maybe it\u2019s better to say, \u201cThis is the type of camp that I do.\u201d\nJames: The way you appear right now is camp.\nCarmelita: Exactly.\nJames: But until you put the boobs on, it wasn\u2019t! That\u2019s what camp is. It\u2019s doing something outrageous and over the top. That\u2019s what camp was. I don\u2019t understand what camp is anymore.\nParker, does \u201ccamp\u201d mean something different to you? Is it even a consideration you have? We\u2019re talking about its origins, but not as much about its present.\nParker: Well, being 23, I\u2019m just now learning about camp, so camp to me is just self-expression. It can be that I dress up like a woman, or I dress up like a dog, or I dress up as a house, or something that\u2019s just super over the top and not me. I don\u2019t want to be like myself.\nZaldy: The idea of camp is more around us now than ever, but we would never refer to it as camp. We just don\u2019t use the word.\nJack: It\u2019s lost its resistant edge. At the point that it becomes a show at the Met sponsored by Gucci, let\u2019s be clear that we are not in open rebellion. At that point, whoever defines themselves as camp has entered the mainstream with a flourish.\nI\u2019d love to hear what you all think about that. If camp began as a kind of private language, it is now, I think, the lingua franca of pop culture \u2014 along with irony. I mean, so many things are camp. We were talking just before about the Kardashians \u2026\nCharles: What\u2019s the difference between just pop culture and camp? I\u2019m not quite sure. Why are the Kardashians camp?\nJames: I don\u2019t think the Kardashians are camp at all.\nZaldy: If you think of the level of artifice of what it is to be a Kardashian \u2014 like, somehow, miraculously, they all look exactly the same now. They\u2019ve all been sculpted to look like a Kardashian and that, to me, is so camp.\nJames: Doesn\u2019t camp have to make you giggle at least? Camp, to me, is like a wife going to her husband\u2019s funeral wearing a Day-Glo orange dress and a big feather boa on her head.\nJack: There are certain things that we probably would agree on as camp that have now disappeared into the mainstream, far removed from any kind of subversive, queer culture. They could still be funny, but the question is, is there a sting to them the way that there is when you watch the queens in \u201cParis Is Burning,\u201d for example? \nThat kind of camp is very pointedly a critique, not just of the fashion world but of the cultural appropriation that the fashion world engages in when it basically is mocking and stealing from Latinos and black gay men, and then calling it high fashion. We could talk about cultural appropriation, I think.\nParker: I don\u2019t understand why people don\u2019t get it yet, or why it\u2019s taken so long with cultural appropriation. When are we going to get the proper recognition for it? Because it\u2019s authentic to us, you know. \nCarmelita: I really like hybridity, that\u2019s what I think of. Mixing everything into something. I am Cuban American, a Latina lesbian, a woman of color \u2014 all those things are brought in. \nI\u2019m very happy that I came, in the \u201980s, to New York to find the WOW Caf\u00e9. I studied theater, but this was a totally different world, and being open to what was going on at that time gave me a camp sensibility without me having read Susan Sontag. I didn\u2019t create thinking of camp, it was just in the culture. I wasn\u2019t thinking, \u201cOh yes, I\u2019m going to do this because it fits this theory, or this is what\u2019s going on.\u201d\nI think that\u2019s an interesting question: Do any of you now think about camp consciously when you\u2019re making work? Is this something that just sort of occurs, or is it something that you pursue?\nZaldy: Well, maybe more in my work because I create costumes \u2014 it just goes hand in hand. If I\u2019m working with Ru, there\u2019s a level of camp, just because RuPaul is RuPaul, and what Ru does is camp. Working with Cirque du Soleil is camp. \nIn a way, it always comes up. I don\u2019t really think about it, it\u2019s just a part of how I was raised, what my outlook is, what my references are. But I would never describe myself as camp, even when I was doing drag.\nI\u2019m curious about the way that camp sensibility is passed down. For all of you, is it something that you absorbed from mentors or environments you were in? Or does it have to be taught?\nZaldy: Watching all those classic \u201960s and \u201970s variety shows, they were all so camp. Camp imagery was just part of my life. Benny Hill. \u201cHee Haw.\u201d Everything was camp. Cher, Carol Burnett, that was camp. \u201cThe Brady Bunch,\u201d \u201cThe Partridge Family,\u201d camp, camp, camp.\nJames: Was \u201cValley of the Dolls\u201d camp?\nCarmelita: So much.\nJames: I don\u2019t think you can just do a bad movie and call it camp. That\u2019s just a bad movie. Unless they went and said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to do this camp,\u201d then it\u2019s just that nobody knew what they were doing. But I\u2019m out of place here. I\u2019m, like, 2,000 years old, and what camp was back in the Stone Age is totally different. ... I mean, I don\u2019t know what anyone\u2019s talking about!\nWas camp part of your understanding of what you were doing?\nParker: I feel like my inspiration from it, and the way it came into my life, is through musical theater and ballet. It was like I was taught camp without really knowing what it was, because I was becoming these characters, doing \u201cRomeo and Juliet,\u201d \u201cSwan Lake.\u201d\nCharles: Certainly there\u2019s a camp element to my work, and I\u2019m part of a tradition. I was influenced by Charles Ludlam, and I guess there are people who are influenced by me. We step on each other\u2019s shoulders in a very good way. \nI\u2019ve sometimes felt that straight press, and even gay press, has sometimes limited me by trying to define anything I do as camp, but there\u2019s certainly large camp elements to my work. Sometimes I can\u2019t really define it myself. \nParker: Yeah, and I think that is the kind of camp that I have. It\u2019s just something I can\u2019t define, it\u2019s just there.\nWe\u2019re talking a lot about the past. Do we need distance to understand camp? Is it easier to be camp about an old movie actress, a ballet role from the repertoire? \nCharles: I would have thought, yet actually listening to this conversation, it\u2019s opening my eyes a bit. I really do think that every generation has the stuff from five years before that they grew up on \u2014 whether it\u2019s the \u201980s for you, or the \u201960s for you. \nFor me, being a teenager in the \u201960s, I\u2019m referencing the things I watched \u2014\u00a0 old movies from the \u201930s, \u201940s and \u201950s, but I\u2019m seeing them on TV, on the 4:30 p.m. movie after school. The past for each generation is a very different place, and that\u2019s the point.\nJack: What if we had a critique of camp, how about that? I\u2019m not somebody who thinks that camp is all that. In fact, in my work I\u2019ve critiqued it as being this sort of canonization of a certain set of cultural expressions, often by white gay men, that then stands in for all of gay culture. \nI think that what we\u2019ve seen with camp is the movement from the margins of society \u2014 being critiqued, and then using camp to answer back \u2014 to the mainstream. Like \u201cQueer Eye for the Straight Guy,\u201d it\u2019s now just mainstream TV. It\u2019s just a mode of making money. When you have five gay men on a cable-TV channel telling everyone how to dress, what products to use, at that point how is it not just capitalism?\nI think that\u2019s a convincing critique. What about on the other side? Are there reasons to celebrate the arrival of camp into the mainstream, or at least into the Met?\nCharles: I think the positive thing about the exhibit \u2014 and I haven\u2019t seen it \u2014 but I think how wonderful to see the costumes of these great figures of the past that have real artistic merit. It\u2019s a great aesthetic, and it\u2019d be wonderful to give it one more viewing.\nJack: I personally don\u2019t think there\u2019s much left of camp. I really don\u2019t. I think the fact that it\u2019s in a museum tells us this is pretty much a punctuation mark at the end of an interesting conversation.\nCarmelita: I wouldn\u2019t say just put the nail in the coffin for camp, because I\u2019m really excited about the young generation. I\u2019m looking for Parker in the future of camp.\nCharles: Do we all get to go to the gala because we participated in this?", "date": "May 4, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/04/style/met-gala-camp-theme.html", "tags": "like \u2018 absolutely think something really camp \u201d james unnatural \u2014 charles"}
