{"title": "In John Bolton, Trump Finds a Fellow Political Blowtorch. Will Foreign Policy Burn?", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Shortly after Ambassador John R. Bolton was sent to represent the United States at the United Nations, an institution he had long scorned as an anti-American citadel of corruption, he hosted President George W. Bush for a visit.\n\u201cAre you having fun?\u201d Mr. Bush asked.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a target-rich environment,\u201d Mr. Bolton replied.\nMr. Bolton, who takes over Monday as President Trump\u2019s third national security adviser with Syria as his most immediate challenge, and talks with North Korea and the future of the Iranian nuclear deal not far behind, loves nothing more than a good target. Over a long and colorful career he has had many of them: the United Nations, first and foremost. But also the International Criminal Court and the Antiballistic Missile Treaty. North Korea. Iran. China. Russia. The Palestinian Authority. The European Union.\nAnd then there are \u201cthe Crusaders of Compromise,\u201d as he terms the elite of the national security world; the diplomats he refers to as \u201cthe High Minded,\u201d with the capital H and capital M; \u201cthe True Believers\u201d of the arms control priesthood. And, of course, Republicans who succumb to such muddled thinking, like Colin L. Powell, Condoleezza Rice and even Mr. Bush.\nBut as Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, the targeter is now slated to become the facilitator, charged with mobilizing the policy apparatus rather than simply taking aim at it. He will start by cleaning house. The first change came Sunday night when the National Security Council spokesman Michael Anton stepped down.\nCombative, relentless and proudly impolitic, known for a bushy mustache that is the delight of cartoonists, Mr. Bolton, the enfant terrible of the Bush administration, has a kindred spirit of sorts in Mr. Trump, a fellow practitioner of blowtorch politics. When Mr. Bolton moves into Henry A. Kissinger\u2019s old corner office in the West Wing, it will be a Trumpian marriage of man and moment.\nAnd yet Mr. Kissinger mastered the office by mastering his relationship with a sometimes volatile boss. For Mr. Bolton, the new assignment may require a form of diplomacy that his previous roles did not, one that eluded his predecessor, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, as well as Rex W. Tillerson, the recently ousted secretary of state.\nMr. Bolton may amplify Mr. Trump\u2019s most bellicose instincts, as their critics fear, but the two differ in key areas and even admirers wonder what will happen then.\n\u201cHow will he manage Trump?\u201d asked Eric S. Edelman, an under secretary of defense under Mr. Bush who was often allied with Mr. Bolton. \u201cTrump may love to see John defending him on Fox News. But when John is going to be responsible for policies, he has very strong convictions on things, some of which won\u2019t line up with the president\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cJohn\u2019s personality is also fairly explosive like the president\u2019s,\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t know how that will work out. That will be John\u2019s big challenge.\u201d\nMr. Bolton defines himself as an \u201cAmericanist\u201d sworn to defend the interests of the United States. Too often, in his view, America has sacrificed its own sovereignty following the chimera of global governance.\n\u201cThis is almost identical to President Trump\u2019s theme of America First,\u201d said Frederick Fleitz, a former intelligence officer who worked for Mr. Bolton. \u201cMr. Bolton disagrees with many of the Washington elite, or maybe the international elite, who think globalism or multilateralism should be a priority over the security of the United States. That\u2019s exactly where President Trump is.\u201d\nIn the world of carrot-and-stick diplomacy, Mr. Bolton is a stick man. \u201cI don\u2019t do carrots,\u201d he has said. Opponents call him a warmonger who never met a problem that did not have a military solution, and he remains a strong supporter of the invasion of Iraq and has made the case for strikes against North Korea and Iran to stop their nuclear programs.\nMr. Bolton insists that he does not relish military action. While he declined to be interviewed for this story, his longtime senior adviser, Sarah Tinsley, quoted him as saying recently that he believes diplomacy works the vast majority of the time.\n\u201cMy belief is diplomatic crises, 99 and 44/100ths percent of them can be resolved with public diplomacy,\u201d Mr. Bolton said, a reference to an old soap commercial. \u201cThat\u2019s my view. To those who say I\u2019m going to start a war, that\u2019s what I think.\u201d\nSome of Mr. Bolton\u2019s harshest critics are those who once worked with him. They use words like \u201carrogant,\u201d \u201cbackstabber\u201d and \u201cdisloyal\u201d and others that cannot be printed in a family newspaper. Some view his ascension to the right hand of an already mercurial president with deep alarm.\n\u201cThis will be the scariest thing that\u2019s happened to us in 50 years,\u201d said Lawrence Wilkerson, chief of staff to Mr. Powell when he was secretary of state. \u201cBolton is several things, none of them good. He\u2019s an absolutely brutal manager, treats people like dirt. The stories that have come out are accurate, but they don\u2019t go far enough. And he\u2019s also possessed of some views that are just revolting.\u201d\nRevolting to his adversaries or refreshing to his admirers, his views are no mystery to anyone who follows him on Twitter or Fox News. In a town of cautious talking points, Mr. Bolton, like Mr. Trump, finds no virtue in subtlety. \u201cChina\u2019s jived us for 25 years.\u201d The Iran nuclear deal \u201cmust be ripped up.\u201d\nThe North Koreans are the \u201cbiggest con men in the world,\u201d and their planned talks with South Korea could be a \u201cpropaganda stunt\u201d to buy time. \u201cQuestion: How do you know that the North Korean regime is lying?\u201d Mr. Bolton asked recently on Fox. \u201cAnswer: Their lips are moving.\u201d\nWhen on another occasion the Fox host Tucker Carlson said the ouster of Saddam Hussein in Iraq had empowered Iran, Mr. Bolton dismissed him. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I think your analysis is simple-minded, frankly.\u201d\n\u201cHe has a very provocative style,\u201d said Stephen J. Hadley, who was Mr. Bush\u2019s national security adviser. \u201cThat\u2019s why he was great on Fox. That\u2019s why he was great on the speaking circuit. He loves to provoke. He loves the combat.\u201d\nMr. Hadley, Ms. Rice and other Bush veterans privately cautioned against Mr. Bolton being named deputy secretary of state when Mr. Trump took office. Mr. Hadley declined to discuss that last week, but like other prominent Republicans who do not subscribe to Mr. Bolton\u2019s style or philosophy, he has reconciled himself to the new appointment.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t fault the choice,\u201d Mr. Hadley said. \u201cThis is a very smart guy, very well educated, very well experienced and knows how to work the system.\u201d\nFormer Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who does not share Mr. Bolton\u2019s hawkish views or approach to diplomacy, nonetheless praised Mr. Bolton, who worked for him in several capacities.\n\u201cJohn, for all of his bluster, his conservative and hawkish bluster, is a pragmatist in my view,\u201d Mr. Baker said in an interview. \u201cHe\u2019s pragmatic enough to want to get things done. The most important thing to him is making it happen, not what the philosophy is after it happens so much.\u201d\nMr. Bolton can surprise people with an unlikely charm and lively sense of humor. After leaving government, he worked for years with political and military figures from across the political spectrum who were paid to advocate for the exiled Iranian opposition group known as the Mujahedeen Khalq, or M.E.K., once deemed a terrorist group until Hillary Clinton reversed the designation.\n\u201cHe was a pleasant guy personally, but a pleasant guy can still end up urging someone to use nukes, just as an irascible guy can,\u201d said Edward G. Rendell, the former Pennsylvania governor and Democratic Party chairman who was also paid to advocate for the group. \u201cI know a lot of people who are a little crazy, who are pleasant.\u201d\nMr. Bolton, 69, was born in Baltimore to first-generation American parents who never graduated from high school. His father, a firefighter and machinist, was a quiet man who kept his opinions to himself. Mr. Bolton inherited his outspokenness from his mother, who he said \u201cwas not a quiet woman\u201d and was a socialist in her youth.\nGrowing up in a rowhouse in southwest Baltimore, Mr. Bolton had police officers, roofers and waitresses for neighbors, an upbringing that shaped his conservative outlook. As a 15-year-old, he handed out leaflets for Barry Goldwater, the Republican presidential candidate in 1964.\nHe went to private school on scholarship and earned his way to Yale for college and law school. During a Class Day speech, Mr. Bolton denounced liberal self-congratulation at Yale. \u201cThe conservative underground is alive and well here,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we do not make our influence felt, rest assured we will in the real world.\u201d\nFriends said he does not talk much about his youth but was likely shaped by his encounters with wealthy elites. \u201cAs someone myself who came from modest means and had the opportunity to be exposed to people with more opportunities than I had, I can understand that John, who had much the same experience at prep school and later at Yale, was motivated by that,\u201d said Tom Boyd, a former aide to Mr. Bolton.\nMr. Bolton had little interest in fighting in Vietnam, and joined the National Guard to avoid it. \u201cI made the cold calculation that I wasn\u2019t going to waste time on a futile struggle,\u201d he wrote in his memoir, \u201cSurrender Is Not An Option.\u201d\nInstead, he interned for Vice President Spiro T. Agnew, then practiced law at the Washington law firm of Covington & Burling. He met Mr. Baker during the 1978 off-year elections, then contacted him for a job after Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1980 election.\nMr. Bolton was named assistant administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, where M. Peter McPherson, who led the agency, remembers him as \u201cvery good at getting the bureaucracy to work, pulling together the policies without huge conflict.\u201d\nDuring Mr. Reagan\u2019s second term, Mr. Bolton became an assistant attorney general, working on Robert H. Bork\u2019s ill-fated Supreme Court nomination and getting to know a congressman named Dick Cheney, a member of a committee investigating the Iran-contra affair.\nWhen the elder George Bush was elected, Mr. Baker named Mr. Bolton assistant secretary of state for international organizations. Mr. Bolton successfully pressed the United Nations to repeal a resolution equating Zionism with racism, making him a hero to Israel supporters.\nWhen George W. Bush tapped Mr. Baker to manage the Florida presidential election recount in 2000, Mr. Bolton volunteered to join the effort, becoming an aggressive advocate in the war over hanging chads. After the Supreme Court ended the recount, Mr. Cheney, now the vice president-elect, pressed Mr. Powell to hire Mr. Bolton, who became assistant secretary for nonproliferation and arms control.\nTo many, Mr. Bolton was Mr. Cheney\u2019s agent at the State Department.\nMr. Wilkerson, a retired Army colonel, found Mr. Bolton\u2019s militarism troubling. At one point, Mr. Wilkerson said he warned Mr. Bolton that war with North Korea could result in 100,000 casualties within 30 days, many of them American.\n\u201cI don\u2019t do war,\u201d he recalled Mr. Bolton replying. \u201cThat\u2019s what you guys do.\u201d\n\u201cOh, you just advocate war?\u201d Mr. Wilkerson said he responded.\n\u201cDamn straight,\u201d Mr. Bolton said by this account.\n(A person familiar with Mr. Bolton\u2019s thinking said he does not recall the exchange.)\nJames A. Kelly, then an assistant secretary seeking a diplomatic solution with North Korea, found Mr. Bolton an obstacle. \u201cHe and his people drove my staff nuts,\u201d he recalled. Mr. Bolton disagreed with the policy. \u201cHe honored it, but he tried to undermine it.\u201d\nMr. Bolton led the move by Mr. Bush to withdraw from the Antiballistic Missile Treaty with Russia. A staunch opponent of the International Criminal Court, he traveled the world negotiating agreements with countries committing them to never refer American soldiers on their territory to the tribunal.\nHe also helped create the Proliferation Security Initiative, an agreement to interdict shipments of materials for weapons of mass destruction. \u201cIt was very consistent with John\u2019s view that we don\u2019t need international staffs, we don\u2019t need new institutions, we just need countries to work together,\u201d said Robert Joseph, an ally on the National Security Council staff.\nAlong the way, Mr. Bolton left bruised feelings. Mr. Powell\u2019s team thought Mr. Bolton was undercutting him. Mr. Bolton thought Mr. Powell was undercutting Mr. Bush\u2019s policies.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a very forceful official, and he will argue his points and you had better be ready to argue yours because he\u2019s going to be very well prepared,\u201d said Elliott Abrams, a deputy national security adviser to Mr. Bush. \u201cA lot of people who are making these complaints simply lost arguments to him. But I never found him to be in any way tricky or underhanded.\u201d\nWhen Mr. Bush was re-elected, Mr. Cheney pressed Ms. Rice, the incoming secretary, to give Mr. Bolton another senior job. She was wary, believing Mr. Bolton had been a \u201cconstant source of trouble for Colin,\u201d as she put it in her memoir, and \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure that I could fully trust John to follow my lead at State.\u201d Instead, she tapped him for the United Nations.\nThat provoked a revolt among former colleagues, who told the Senate that Mr. Bolton had been rough on subordinates and politicized intelligence, citing in particular a report on biological weapons in Cuba. Mr. Bolton flatly denied that, but Mr. Powell quietly told senators that he did not think Mr. Bolton was right for the job, and the Senate refused to confirm him.\nMr. Bush gave Mr. Bolton a recess appointment, sending him to the United Nations, where he jousted with diplomats and functionaries to overhaul the organization and block moves he thought undermined American sovereignty. Inside the administration, he resisted negotiations with North Korea, deeming it appeasement. When North Korea denounced him as \u201chuman scum\u201d or Venezuela called him \u201cthe most sinister figure in the U.N.,\u201d he took it as a badge of honor.\n\u201cHe was a practitioner, sometimes along with others, of sledgehammer diplomacy, a take-it-or-leave-it approach to diplomacy,\u201d said R. Nicholas Burns, who as under secretary sparred regularly with Mr. Bolton. Mr. Burns argued for compromise and patient work with allies. \u201cYou can\u2019t just default to leverage, pressure and force.\u201d\nWhen his recess appointment expired after 17 months, the Senate was still disinclined to confirm Mr. Bolton, who was privately upset that Mr. Bush did not push more. He left his post and became an outspoken critic of the president who appointed him, lamenting what he saw as the drift from Mr. Cheney\u2019s assertiveness to Ms. Rice\u2019s accommodation, especially on North Korea.\nNow the North Korea brief falls to him as his new boss prepares to meet with its leader, Kim Jong-un. In Fox appearances before his appointment, Mr. Bolton said the only topic of discussion should be the logistics for how North Korea would surrender its nuclear weapons program to the United States.\nThe meeting, he suggested, should be held in the same room in Geneva where Mr. Baker confronted Iraq\u2019s foreign minister shortly before the Gulf War of 1991. \u201cI think Kim Jong-un ought to sit in that room and look around,\u201d he said, \u201cand think about what happened when he stiffed a former U.S. president.\u201d", "date": "April 8, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/08/us/politics/john-bolton-trump.html", "tags": "finds policy bush burn \u201c bolton united political trump blowtorch foreign fellow john north korea"}
