Get on your dragon and fly out of here if you\u2019re not caught up with \u201cGame Of Thrones.\u201d\nWell, Daenerys Targaryen channeled her father, the Mad King, in the latest episode of \u201cGame Of Thrones\u201d and effectively burned down all of King\u2019s Landing.\nEarly in the episode, the Mother of Dragons was told she should keep an ear open for the bells if she planned to take on King\u2019s Landing. Ringing bells would signify that the city had surrendered.\nDespite being two dragons down from her initial three, Daenerys managed to bring the city to its knees and breathe fire on all the opposing army men in her path.
