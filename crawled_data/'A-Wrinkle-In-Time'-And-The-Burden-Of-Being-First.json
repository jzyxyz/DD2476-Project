{"title": "'A Wrinkle In Time' And The Burden Of Being First", "content": "\u201cA Wrinkle in Time,\u201d Ava DuVernay\u2019s sci-fi blockbuster for Disney, is the latest casualty in the so-called culture wars. With its wildly diverse cast and its message of empowerment for young girls,\u00a0the movie has been described variously with admiration and disdain \u2015 declared both \u201crevolutionary\u201d and a \u201cnoble failure.\u201d\nOne particularly salty review from The Federalist\u00a0called it a\u00a0\u201cvictim of diversity-deranged stunt casting ... more interested in promoting colorblind multi-culturalism than producing an entertaining adaptation.\u201d\nAnother article on Fox News\u00a0condemned some cultural critics for \u201ctrying to look away from the movie\u2019s problems and instead fawn over its politicized message,\u201d and suggested that DuVernay \u201ccares more about advancing social issues than making money for Disney.\u201d The headline refers to the project as \u201cOprah\u2019s ultra-PC\u201d film.\nThere is no question that this movie is important and deeply necessary. There is also no question that it is flawed, and that some critiques\u00a0\u2014 of its pacing, its world-building, its effects\u00a0\u2014 are valid. Several things can be true at once.\u00a0\nBut in the wake of the stellar success of \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d it is worth asking why the specific detail of the film\u2019s deliberately inclusive casting is the subject of so much vitriol. What is the impetus behind equating the movie\u2019s perceived failures \u2015 it\u2019s projected to make around $30 million this weekend, a decent but not stellar amount \u2015 with its diversity?\nOne wonders a great many things about these critics. One wonders if those complaining that PC culture and \u201cmulti-culturalism\u201d\u00a0have \u201cruined\u201d the source material \u2014 Madeleine L\u2019Engle\u2019s 1962 novel,\u00a0in which main character Meg Murry is assumed to be white\u00a0\u2014 truly care all that much about the adaptation\u2019s fidelity to the text. One wonders if the criticism and complaints would cease if the movie were simply based on an original story, or if the mere idea of a diverse cast and crew, no matter the source material, is the main issue here. One wonders if these critics felt the same amount of disgust at the idea of Scarlett Johansson portraying Major Kusanagi in \u201cGhost in the Shell,\u201d a movie that was simply OK.\nOne wonders, too, about the critic I was speaking with last month about the future box office potential of black filmmakers and black-led films. This critic said \u201cA Wrinkle In Time\u201d shouldn\u2019t be part of the conversation, because it\u2019s \u201chalf white.\u201d The critic continued: \u201cIt\u2019s not a black movie. You\u2019ve got Reese Witherspoon and Chris Pine. It\u2019s just a different thing.\u201d\u00a0\nThe success of \u201cBlack Panther\u201d was one thing, but \u201cA Wrinkle in Time\u201d represents, in many ways, a far bigger and more important shift in the ongoing, often exhausting conversation about diversity and representation in Hollywood. What does it mean for someone like DuVernay to make a movie that is difficult, divisive, not universally loved? Why must the critics hedge their negative reviews with patronizing words like \u201cnoble failure?\u201d\u00a0Why aren\u2019t black artists (especially women) given space to fail and win, to be the first but not the best?\nAfter seeing \u201cA Wrinkle in Time\u201d this week, an\u00a0image of actress Dorothy Dandridge\u00a0came to mind. It\u2019s an image of Dandridge in her prime, arriving on the red carpet the night of the 27th Academy Awards in 1955. She\u2019s wearing long silk gloves, a glamorous fur stole, a stunning, long chiffon gown. She\u2019s smiling, waving at the cameras, looking every bit the classic Hollywood star she is. But that night she\u2019s more than just a movie star, of course \u2015 she\u2019s the first black woman, ever, to be nominated for Best Actress at the Oscars.\u00a0\u00a0\nI\u2019ve always wondered what was going through Dandridge\u2019s mind in that photo, during that whole night. I\u2019ve often wondered what, if anything, her megawatt smile might have been concealing as she made history, coming so\u00a0close to gracing the Oscars stage and becoming the first black woman to accept that award. I\u2019ve wondered if she guessed that she would eventually lose (to Grace Kelly), whether she contemplated what losing, for her, a black sex symbol in a racist white town, would ultimately mean.\u00a0\nI\u2019ve wondered about whatever feelings of exhilaration and precariousness she might have felt that night\u00a0\u2014\u00a0 the exhilaration and precariousness of being a\u00a0first.\u00a0\n\u201cA Wrinkle in Time,\u201d itself,\u00a0represents a huge industry first:\u00a0the first live-action movie with a budget of more than $100 million ever to be directed by a black woman.\u00a0\nAnd DuVernay herself has many firsts under her belt: the first African-American to win the U.S. directing award in Sundance\u2019s dramatic category, the first black female director to have a film nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars,\u00a0the\u00a0first black woman\u00a0to be nominated for Best Director at the Golden Globes, the first black woman nominated for Best Documentary at the Oscars, etc.\u00a0\nBut the thing about being \u201cfirst\u201d that we never really talk about when we praise pioneering black entertainers, athletes and politicians is how incredibly charged it is with an energy of devastating expectation. Making history means you\u2019re celebrated, yes, but it also means you\u2019re the only one, the first, and with that comes its own baggage.\u00a0DuVernay is experiencing what so many black folks who are the \u201cfirst\u201d to do anything experience \u2015 the burden of expectations far exceeding those placed on many of her white, male peers, the burden of an individual\u2019s failures being seen in some circles as pervasively revealing of blackness in general.\nThe movie isn\u2019t great for many reasons. I can\u2019t pretend that some of its more earnest lines didn\u2019t make me cringe, that it wasn\u2019t at various points clunky, disjointed and unsure of itself. But the movie also spoke to me on an emotional level that, yes, made it easier for me \u2014 a young black woman who grew up with deep self-hatred, who believed she\u2019d never accomplish anything in life and had few things in her world to suggest the opposite\u00a0\u2014 to look away from its problems.\nI don\u2019t know whether that connection is less important, less relevant than whether this movie is good or bad. I don\u2019t know how to shut off my perspective in order to be more \u201cobjective.\u201d But I also don\u2019t know why this, so often, is asked of people of color who experience art of any kind.\u00a0\u00a0", "date": "\n03/09/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/a-wrinkle-in-time-ava-duvernay_n_5aa27655e4b07047bec58d99", "tags": "first movie \u201d one woman black many time \u2014 burden wrinkle"}
