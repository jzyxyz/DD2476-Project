{"title": "How Mark Zuckerberg Became Too Big to Fail", "content": "A few weeks ago, after Facebook revealed that tens of millions of its users\u2019 accounts had been exposed in a security breach, I began asking people in and around the tech industry a simple question: Should Mark Zuckerberg still be running Facebook?\nI\u2019ll spare you the suspense. Just about everyone thought Mr. Zuckerberg was still the right man for the job, if not the only man for the job. This included people who currently work at Facebook, people who used to work at Facebook, financial analysts, venture capitalists, tech-skeptic activists, ardent critics of the company and its giddiest supporters.\nThe consensus went like this: Even if Mr. Zuckerberg \u2014 as Facebook\u2019s founder, chief executive, chairman and most powerful shareholder \u2014 bore most of the responsibility for the company\u2019s cataclysmic recent history, he alone possessed the stature to fix it. \nMore than one of his supporters told me it was bad faith to even broach the subject \u2014 that Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s indispensability was so plain that the only reason I might have to ask whether he should still run the company was the clicks I would get on this article. But even critics were not that excited about the idea of Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s removal. Barry Lynn, executive director of the Open Markets Institute, an organization that fights monopoly power, argued that Facebook\u2019s problems grew out of its business model and the legal and regulatory vacuum in which it has operated \u2014 not the man who runs it.\n\u201cTo be blunt, if we took Mark Zuckerberg out and we replaced him with Mahatma Gandhi, I don\u2019t think the corporation would change in any significant way,\u201d Mr. Lynn said.\nThat few can imagine a Facebook without Mr. Zuckerberg, 34, underscores how unaccountable our largest tech companies have become. Mr. Zuckerberg, thanks to his own drive and brilliance, has become one of the most powerful unelected people in the world. Like an errant oil company or sugar-pumping food company, Facebook makes decisions that create huge consequences for society \u2014 and he has profited handsomely from the chaos.\nYet because of Facebook\u2019s ownership structure \u2014 in which Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s shares have 10 times the voting power of ordinary shares \u2014 he is omnipotent there, answering basically to no one. \nThis fits a pattern. Over the last two decades, the largest tech companies have created a system in which executives suffer few personal or financial consequences for their mistakes. Big tech has turned founders into fixtures \u2014 when their companies are working well, they get all the credit, and when their companies are doing badly, they are the only heroes who can fix them.\nThere\u2019s another way to put this: For better or worse, Mr. Zuckerberg has become too big to fail.\nIn America, it\u2019s not unusual for executives to escape punishment for how they steer their corporations (see Wall Street after the 2008 financial crisis). Still, when companies step in it badly, there are often at least calls for their leaders\u2019 dismissal. The chief executives of Equifax and Target were pushed out after data breaches. The chief executive of Wells Fargo was ousted after a scandal involving sham accounts. \nEven in Silicon Valley, where company founders are revered as money-laying rainbow unicorns, there is some limit to corporate patience. In the 1980s, Apple fired Steve Jobs. Last year, Uber ousted Travis Kalanick, who was as closely aligned with his company\u2019s culture as Mr. Zuckerberg is with his.\nFacebook\u2019s problems have not reached the level of lawlessness we saw at Uber, but they have been far more consequential. Besides the breach, Facebook has been implicated in a global breakdown of democracy, including its role as a vector for Russian disinformation during the 2016 American presidential election. \nInvestigators for the United Nations have said Facebook was instrumental to genocide in Myanmar; it has also been tied to violence in India, South Sudan and Sri Lanka. There have been privacy scandals (Cambridge Analytica most recently), advertising scandals (discriminatory ads, fishy metrics), multiple current federal inquiries, and an admission that using Facebook can be detrimental to your mental health.\nEven though Mr. Zuckerberg has apologized and vowed again and again and again to fix Facebook, the company\u2019s fixes often need fixing. In the last week, reporters showed that the company\u2019s recent move to clamp down on political ads has not worked \u2014 Vice News bought Facebook ads falsely stating that they were \u201cpaid for\u201d by Vice President Mike Pence and ISIS.\nSo given such failures, another question might be: Why haven\u2019t any heads rolled at Facebook? Although there have been some high-profile defections \u2014 the co-founders of WhatsApp, Instagram and Oculus, all companies bought by Facebook, left in the last few months \u2014 Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s most loyal executives have been with him through thick and thin, many for more than a decade.\nIf Facebook admits now that its problems were caused by a too-idealistic, move-fast culture, and if it is conceding now that its culture must change, how can we be sure that\u2019s happening if most of the people who run Facebook remain the same?\nWhen I asked Facebook about this, the company argued that things were changing. It just hired Nick Clegg, a former deputy prime minister of Britain, as head of global affairs \u2014 a move that the company said imbued it with a serious outsider\u2019s perspective.\nThe social network also put me on the phone with a top executive who argued boisterously for Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s leadership, but declined to do so on the record. The executive explained that fixing Facebook would involve deep costs. The company is hiring more people to review content, for example, and it might have to slow down some of its most ambitious projects to address its impact on the world. The executive argued that Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s total domination of Facebook\u2019s equity, plus the reverence in which employees hold him, allowed him to weather the financial consequences of these changes better than any other leader.\nFacebook\u2019s stock price plunged nearly 20 percent on a single day this summer after it reported slowing revenue growth and increased operational costs. This week, Facebook repeated its slower-growth warning. A \u201cprofessional C.E.O.,\u201d one without such a huge stake in the company, would be tempted to try the easy way out, the executive suggested. But Mr. Zuckerberg was free to do what\u2019s right.\nMr. Zuckerberg\u2019s supporters also argued that he has shown a deep capacity to understand and address Facebook\u2019s problems. After the company went public in 2012, its stock price languished for months because it had no plan to make money from consumers\u2019 shift to mobile devices.\n\u201cMark would tell you that he was too late in understanding the importance of mobile \u2014 but when that became apparent, Mark understood its gravity and he understood how to fix it,\u201d said Don Graham, a former Facebook board member and former publisher of The Washington Post. \u201cHe changed the direction of that company incredibly fast, in detail, not by one action but by 20 actions \u2014 and if you looked at the quarter-by-quarter numbers of what percentage of Facebook\u2019s revenue was coming from mobile, I couldn\u2019t believe how fast it changed.\u201d\nThe question at Facebook now is whether Mr. Zuckerberg has similarly seen the light on its current problems. He has said fixing Facebook was his personal challenge for 2018. But there are signs that its culture remains the same. \nConsider its promise that a new home-hub device, Portal, which it unveiled this month, would not collect information on users that could be used in ads. It had to swiftly walk back that promise because Facebook\u2019s data-collection system is so pervasive that even some of its employees don\u2019t seem to understand it.\n\u201cI think he has demonstrably failed over the last two years, and the reason he\u2019s failed is because he\u2019s unaccountable,\u201d said Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook employee who is now chief strategy officer for the Center of Humane Technology, an activist organization. \u201cGiven a scenario where shareholders and board members had more influence, it\u2019s hard to imagine that there would not have been changes faster.\u201d\nOne fix for Facebook might be to give the board greater power over the company. Trillium Asset Management, an investment firm, recently put forward a shareholder resolution supported by several state funds that would require Mr. Zuckerberg to step down as Facebook\u2019s chairman, though he would still maintain majority voting control of the company.\n\u201cI think by taking the step to relinquish the position of the board chair, it\u2019s a very important structural change so that he would not have a completely free hand to muscle his way through decisions,\u201d said Jonas Kron, a Trillium senior vice president.\nA Facebook spokesman said the company had not yet taken a position on the resolution. In the past, similar measures have been voted down by Mr. Zuckerberg and his allies. \nWhich leaves us here: Either Mr. Zuckerberg fixes Facebook, or no one does. That\u2019s the choice we face, like it or not.", "date": "Nov. 1, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/01/technology/mark-zuckerberg-facebook.html", "tags": "company \u201c fail became facebook mark executive \u2014 zuckerberg said big"}
