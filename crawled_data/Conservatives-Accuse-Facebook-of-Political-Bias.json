{"title": "Conservatives Accuse Facebook of Political Bias", "content": "Facebook scrambled on Monday to respond to a new and startling line of attack: accusations of political bias.\nThe outcry was set off by a report on Monday morning by the website Gizmodo, which said that Facebook\u2019s team in charge of the site\u2019s \u201ctrending\u201d list had intentionally suppressed articles from conservative news sources. The social network uses the trending feature to indicate the most popular news articles of the day to users.\nFacebook denied the allegations after a backlash \u2014 from both conservative and liberal critics \u2014 erupted. \u201cIt is beyond disturbing to learn that this power is being used to silence viewpoints and stories that don\u2019t fit someone else\u2019s agenda,\u201d read a statement from the Republican National Committee. \u201cNOT LEANING IN\u2026 LEANING LEFT!\u201d blared the top story on The Drudge Report, a widely read website.\nThe journalist Glenn Greenwald, hardly a conservative ally, weighed in on Twitter: \u201cAside from fueling right-wing persecution, this is a key reminder of dangers of Silicon Valley controlling content.\u201d And Alexander Marlow, the editor in chief of Breitbart News, a conservative-leaning publication, said the report confirmed \u201cwhat conservatives have long suspected.\u201d\nFacebook, in response, says that it follows rigorous guidelines \u201cto ensure consistency and neutrality\u201d and that it works to be inclusive of all perspectives. \u201cWe take allegations of bias very seriously,\u201d a Facebook spokeswoman said in a statement. \u201cFacebook is a platform for people and perspectives from across the political spectrum.\u201d\nThe back-and-forth highlights the extent to which Facebook has now muscled its way into America\u2019s political conversation \u2014 and the risks that the company faces as it becomes a central force in news consumption and production.\nWith more than 222 million monthly active users in the United States and Canada, the site has become a place that people flock to to find out what is going on. Last year, a study by the Pew Research Center, in collaboration with the Knight Foundation, found that 63 percent of Facebook\u2019s users considered the service a news source.\nIn April, Facebook embraced this role openly, releasing a video to implore people to search Facebook to discover \u201cthe other side of the story.\u201d Politicians have increasingly shared their messages through the social network.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that Facebook has changed fundamentally over the past four, eight years,\u201d said Paul Brewer, director of the University of Delaware Center for Political Communication. \u201cIt\u2019s the sheer volume of communication that\u2019s taking place, and it\u2019s that politicians know that they need to be using Facebook now more than ever before to communicate.\u201d\nAs it has become more influential, Facebook has taken pains to say that it is not an echo chamber of similar opinions. In a peer-reviewed study published last year, Facebook\u2019s data scientists analyzed how 10.1 million of the most partisan American users on the social network navigated the site over a six-month period. They found that people\u2019s networks of friends and the articles they saw were skewed toward their ideological preferences \u2014 but that the effect was more limited than the worst case some theorists had predicted, in which people would see almost no information from the other side.\nYet Gizmodo\u2019s report raises questions about the effects that Facebook\u2019s staff members and their biases \u2014 even unconscious ones \u2014 have on the social network.\nWhile Facebook has pledged to sponsor both the Democratic and Republican national conventions, the company\u2019s top executives have not been shy about expressing where their political sympathies lie.\nAt a Facebook conference in April, Mark Zuckerberg, the company\u2019s chief executive, warned of \u201cfearful voices building walls,\u201d in reference to Donald Trump, the probable Republican presidential candidate.\nThe allegations against Facebook also put the spotlight on how it chooses which news articles to show users under the trending function \u2014 on desktop computers, \u201ctrending\u201d displays on the right side of screens; on cellphones, it appears when users search.\nFacebook has long described its trending feature as largely automatic. \u201cThe topics you see are based on a number of factors including engagement, timeliness, pages you\u2019ve liked and your location,\u201d according to a description on Facebook\u2019s site.\nThe trending feature is curated by a team of contract employees, according to two former Facebook employees who worked on it and who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of nondisclosure agreements. They said they considered themselves members of a newsroom-like operation, where editorial discretion was not novel but was an integral part of the process.\nAny \u201csuppression,\u201d the former employees said, was based on perceived credibility \u2014 any articles judged by curators to be unreliable or poorly sourced, whether left-leaning or right-leaning, were avoided, though this was a personal judgment call.\nThe perception of Facebook as a more conventional news operation opens it to a more familiar line of criticism, which has been mounted against news organizations left and right, large and small, for decades. According to a report last year by Pew, only 17 percent surveyed said that technology companies had a negative influence on the country. For the news media, that number was 65 percent \u2014 and rising.\n\u201cThe agenda-setting power of a handful of companies like Facebook and Twitter should not be underestimated,\u201d said Jonathan Zittrain, a professor of computer science and law at Harvard University. \u201cThese services will be at their best when they are explicitly committed to serving the interests of their users rather than simply offering a service whose boundaries for influence are unknown and ever-changing.\u201d\nBy late Monday, users on the social network looking for more information about the Gizmodo report did not have to look far: It was among the top articles trending on Facebook.", "date": "May 9, 2016", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/10/technology/conservatives-accuse-facebook-of-political-bias.html", "tags": "users trending bias report news political \u201d accuse facebook articles conservatives \u2014"}
