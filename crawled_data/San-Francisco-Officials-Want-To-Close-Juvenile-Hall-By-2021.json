{"title": "San Francisco Officials Want To Close Juvenile Hall By 2021", "content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2015 Dozens of community organizers, youths and city officials stood on the steps of San Francisco\u2019s City Hall on Tuesday, rallying in support of a new measure to shut down the county\u2019s juvenile hall by the end of 2021. \n\u201cWe\u2019re going to shut down juvenile hall, close youth prisons and build leaders together,\u201d Supervisor Shamann\u00a0Walton, who spent time in juvenile hall as a youth, said to cheers from the crowd. People held signs reading, \u201cBooks not bars,\u201d \u201cFree us kids\u201d and \u201cNo youth jail.\u201d\nMembers of the city\u2019s Board of Supervisors introduced legislation on Tuesday, backed by six of the 11 supervisors, to close the youth detention center within three years and instead create programs to serve as \u201calternatives to incarceration\u201d for youth who don\u2019t need to be detained and a smaller rehabilitative \u201cnon-institutional\u201d center for those who need to be in a facility by law.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe bill would create a 12-person working group, made up of officials from city agencies, juvenile justice experts and community members, who\u2019d spend the next couple of years designing alternatives. It would also create a fund to redirect money previously allocated for the juvenile hall to community-based programs, mental health support and academic help for youths involved in the justice system. \nThe city\u2019s public defender\u2019s office and District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n have both come out in support of the measure, with Gasc\u00f3n saying in the supervisors\u2019 news release: \u201cThe days of big juvenile halls should be behind us.\u201d \n\u201cThere is no way in hell we could put a system in place that is worse than juvenile hall,\u201d Walton said at the rally, calling instead for efforts like mentorship and quality after-school programs to give young people \u201copportunities rather than teach them how to be institutionalized.\u201d\nSan Francisco\u2019s juvenile hall had 45 young people (ages 13 to 18) detained in January, according to the city\u2019s juvenile probation department report. The youth detention facility, which can hold up to 132 people, is meant to detain youth accused of committing offenses and who are awaiting court hearings or court-ordered placement.\nThe legislation followed a San Francisco Chronicle report\u00a0last month that documented the drop in youth crime rates across the state in recent years, decreasing the populations in juvenile halls, though spending on facilities remained at high levels. The newspaper found the average daily population in San Francisco\u2019s juvenile hall had dropped by half\u00a0since 2011 but spending remained about $11 million, making the annual cost of detention about $270,000 per person last year. \n\u201cWe have to stop putting kids behind bars,\u201d Supervisor Hillary Ronen, who is a co-author of the bill, tweeted Monday. \u201cWe can use the millions we\u2019re spending to maintain an ineffective 3/4 empty jail OR we can use the brilliance in our community to reinvent a rehabilitative alternative. Let\u2019s do the latter.\u201d\nThere are also stark racial disparities in the population of young people who are detained: In San Francisco, while about 5% of children in the city are black, about 60%\u00a0of the juvenile hall population in January was black. \n\u201cBy ignoring the harms of incarceration, the City is ignoring the damage that it is doing to its young people of color,\u201d Meredith Desautels, staff attorney at Youth Law Center, a San Francisco-based youth justice advocacy group, told HuffPost by email. \nMayor London Breed does not appear to support the juvenile hall\u2019s closing, saying in a statement Tuesday to HuffPost that it was \u201cirresponsible to begin this incredibly important conversation that will impact people\u2019s lives by presupposing any outcomes.\u201d\nOn Monday, Breed announced a \u201cJuvenile Justice Blue Ribbon Panel\u201d to start meeting later this month and make recommendations for reforms to the juvenile justice system. One of its aims is to \u201cdrastically reduce\u201d the number of young people detained in juvenile hall, according to a news release.\nThe new legislation to close the facility will likely come to a final vote in June after moving through the legislative process, the Chronicle reported. The bill would need the backing of eight supervisors to override a potential mayoral veto. HuffPost asked Breed\u2019s office if she would veto the bill, but her office did not immediately provide a response.
