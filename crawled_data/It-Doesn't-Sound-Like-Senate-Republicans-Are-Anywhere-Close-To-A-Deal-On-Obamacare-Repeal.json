More than two weeks later, Senate Republicans are nowhere near reaching an agreement on a bill of their own.\nAs scandal after scandal piled up for the Trump administration last week, Republicans were given some cover. Rather than being flooded with questions as they exited multiple meetings about their own disagreements on how to repeal and replace Obamacare, they were asked about the firing of FBI Director James Comey and the investigation into Russia\u2019s meddling in the presidential campaign.\nBut even with some of the pressure off, they appear to have made only a little headway \u2015 enough to identify the key issues dividing them but not to make much progress on resolving those differences.\nA substantial number of Senate Republicans have made it clear they cannot vote for the House bill, which would reduce regulations on health insurance, rearrange tax credits for people buying health insurance and dramatically cut funding for Medicaid \u2015 leaving many millions of Americans without health insurance while exposing older, sicker people to some combination of higher premiums and out-of-pocket costs.\nThe Medicaid cut is a big sticking point for senators from states such as Ohio and West Virginia that have expanded the program and have come to rely on it to finance treatment amid an opioid addiction epidemic. \nAsked if she still had concerns about the health care talks, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) said her problems haven\u2019t changed from weeks ago when the House passed its bill.\n\u201cWell, still the Medicaid expansion piece, and whether the tax credits are sufficient at the lower end,\u201d she said, referring to credits afforded to older Americans who face higher premiums under the House bill. \u201cThose are the two biggest.\u201d\nSen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) backed up Capito\u2019s complaints and added that the House bill\u00a0goes too far in \u201cnot protecting\u201d communities reeling from the opioid epidemic. Still, Portman wouldn\u2019t offer details on where talks are headed.\nAnd scaling back the Medicaid cuts or bolstering tax credits for older consumers \u2015 a priority for many GOP senators \u2015 costs money. And the Republicans don\u2019t have a lot of money at their disposal.\nUnder the rules of the budget reconciliation process \u2015 a procedural mechanism Republicans are using to avoid a Democratic filibuster \u2015 the Senate\u2019s bill can\u2019t increase the deficit. The only way to free up money would be to keep more of Obamacare\u2019s taxes in place \u2015 and doing that risks losing the support of more conservative members who, all things being equal, would rather the Senate bill look more like the House bill, not less.\nThe parliamentary math for GOP leaders is difficult. Even under reconciliation rules, which allow Republicans to pass legislation with just 50 votes assuming Vice President Mike Pence breaks the tie, leadership can afford to lose only two members. And there are plenty more than two members who seem convinced the Senate is far from agreeing on anything.\nAsked to share what major sticking points are holding up the talks, Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) laughed and said: \u201cWhere do I start?\u201d\nSen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) told HuffPost he isn\u2019t even sure where negotiations are headed. \n\u201cIt\u2019s totally fluid,\u201d he said, adding that he has no clue when the Senate would even be ready to bring a bill to the floor. \n\u201cI\u2019m not ducking. I just can\u2019t answer it,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\nAnd the current disagreements among Republicans could only become worse once the Congressional Budget Office releases its projection on the effects of the House bill. \nThe CBO score, which is expected Wednesday, is \u201cvery important,\u201d Cassidy said. He stressed that it will help \u201cinform policy decisions\u201d facing Republicans in the Senate, and he appeared hopeful that it would steer his colleagues away from the House bill. \n\u201cThere\u2019s still some idea that we might use the House plan as a basis for which to proceed,\u201d he said. \nOf course, the prospects for getting a repeal bill through the House looked bleak until it didn\u2019t. After House leaders pulled the bill in March because it didn\u2019t have the votes, senior members began negotiating quietly on their own until they\u2019d worked out a deal capable of \u2015 just barely \u2015 getting enough votes to pass.\nIt looks as if Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is trying to do the same thing by having his caucus work out a deal behind closed doors and then bring it to the floor right when he is within striking distance of a majority. Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) is among the senators who\u00a0aren\u2019t happy about the process. On Tuesday, that irritation came to a boiling point for him.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very awkward process, at best,\u201d Corker said. \u201cThere are no experts. There\u2019s no actuarials. \u2026 Typically, in a hearing, you\u2019d have people coming in, and you\u2019d also have the media opining about if a hearing took place and X came in and made comments.\u201d\nLater Corker called the entire saga \u201cvery difficult at best,\u201d adding that there\u2019s been \u201ca lot of progress in understanding the problems\u201d senators have with the House bill, and between each other, \u201cbut there\u2019s no bill written.\u201d \nBut leadership hasn\u2019t indicated a desire to move negotiations out into the open, and it\u2019s not so hard to imagine how, eventually, they could work out a deal that would get them close to the 50 votes they need \u2015 while still keeping the guts of the House plan and its dramatic effects on insurance coverage.\nLeaders might try to win over holdouts like Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), who has said she wants to protect her state\u2019s Medicaid population, by offering extra money for Alaska \u2015 much as Democrats in 2009 used special funding for Nebraska to bring along then-Sen. Ben Nelson (D-Neb.) in what became known as the \u201cCornhusker Kickback.\u201d Maybe they could win over Capito and Portman with extra money for opioid treatment as a way to replace a little bit of the money their states would lose from Medicaid.\u00a0\nOn the Medicaid expansion front, Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) offered some insight into where the talks are at, saying there\u2019s an interest among many Republicans to have a \u201clonger tail on [repeal] phase-out.\u201d Under the House bill, the extra federal funds for Medicaid expansion would phase out starting in 2020.\u00a0Senate Republicans could push back that date or find some other way to make the transition more gradual, although, notably, the debate seems to be over when \u2015 and not whether \u2015 to end federal funding for the expansion.\nThere\u2019s also the issue of pre-existing conditions and the tax credits, which are sticking points for Thune himself. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of members who\u2019ve made statements and are very committed to having a solution in place for pre-existing conditions. There are just a lot of ideas about how to do it,\u201d Thune said.\nAnd the tax credits are a \u201cwork in progress,\u201d Thune said. A big concern there, he said, is that the House bill \u2015 unlike the Affordable Care Act \u2015 doesn\u2019t tailor the tax credits to income, making it a lot harder for the poor and even some middle-class consumers to afford coverage.\nA lot depends on whether external political events, like the upcoming special House elections in Georgia and Montana, change the political calculus of Republicans \u2015 so many of whom seem convinced that the political cost of doing nothing is worse than the political cost of doing something that appears to be highly unpopular.\nAbout the only sure thing seems to be that neither GOP leaders nor members want to be dealing with health care forever. They continue to say they would like a vote no later than the August recess, even though the possibility of reaching a deal by then seems highly uncertain.\nAs Thune put it, \u201cAt some point we need to vote, and so that day of reckoning will come.\u201d ", "date": "\n05/23/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/senate-republicans-health-care-repeal_n_5924b986e4b00c8df29fd656", "tags": "obamacare anywhere sound repeal medicaid close \u201d \u2015 house senate bill republicans like deal"}
