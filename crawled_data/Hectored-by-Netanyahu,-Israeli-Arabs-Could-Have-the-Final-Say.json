{"title": "Hectored by Netanyahu, Israeli Arabs Could Have the Final Say", "content": "UMM AL-FAHM, Israel \u2014 With three weeks to go, the Israeli election is so close that Arab voters, who make up only a fifth of the population, could help bring Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s long career to an abrupt end.\nMr. Netanyahu has been fanning the flames of anti-Arab sentiment almost daily.\nHe has warned Israelis that his main challenger, the retired army chief Benny Gantz, would \u201chand over parts of the homeland to the Arabs\u201d and that he would make alliances with Arab parties that \u201cwant to destroy\u201d Israel. Mr. Netanyahu has also joined forces with a racist faction whose leaders support expelling Arab citizens and call them \u201cthe enemy.\u201d\nSuch appeals have worked for Mr. Netanyahu in the past. This time they might backfire.\nSmall Arab communities like the Druze, who prize their loyalty to the state and often vote for right-wing parties, show signs of deserting Mr. Netanyahu en masse, according to a new poll from the University of Maryland. The poll also suggests that Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s racial provocations may spur turnout among Arab voters motivated to usher him out of office.\n[Read our overview of the Israel elections.]\nIf the race between Mr. Gantz\u2019s Blue and White party and Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s Likud remains a nail-biter, the swing of a single seat in Parliament could be decisive.\nAnd the two Arab parties could, as Mr. Netanyahu warns, help make Mr. Gantz the prime minister through postelection deal-making.\n\u201cWe need to tell Netanyahu, \u2018Thank you for your incitement, now go home,\u2019\u201d said Afif Abu Much, 37, a computer engineer and political activist from Baqa al Gharbiyye, a town abutting the West Bank.\nThe danger for Mr. Netanyahu is that his belaboring of the threat posed by Palestinians could drive them to the ballot box.\nBased on a new survey of more than 700 Arab voters, Shibley Telhami, director of the University of Maryland\u2019s Critical Issues Poll, projects that Arab turnout will rise to 69 percent of eligible Arab voters, up from about 64 percent in 2015.\n\u201cFor now, it looks like this strategy is working against Netanyahu, not for him,\u201d Mr. Telhami said.\nBut with three weeks to go, anything could happen. Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s strategy has proved reliable before and could still succeed if it depresses the Arab vote while energizing right-wing Israelis.\nIt was already a stormy time for Arab citizens of Israel, who were jolted last year by passage of a basic law formally declaring their country the nation-state of the Jewish people alone. The law, pushed through by Mr. Netanyahu, downgraded the Arabic language and dealt a blow to ideals of equality.\nMr. Abu Much still winces at the memory of a slogan in Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s first election, in 1996: \u201cBibi is good for the Jews.\u201d The implication for Arab voters, many of whom prefer to be called Palestinian citizens of Israel, was clear.\nIn his most recent campaign, in 2015, Mr. Netanyahu played on racial enmity on Election Day, warning that Arabs were being bused to the polls \u201cin droves.\u201d It energized his supporters, and he won handily, though he drew stern rebukes from the Obama administration and was forced to apologize.\nIn a sly wink to that remark, Israel\u2019s leading Arab politicians, Ayman Odeh and Ahmad Tibi, are running ads showing themselves smiling in front of buses and urging voters to \u201cflock to the polling stations.\u201d\nThis year, with little fear of White House pressure and ample reason not to wait, Mr. Netanyahu has stirred the pot on a daily basis.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not new, but he\u2019s made it into an art form,\u201d said Amal Jamal, a professor at Tel Aviv University who specializes in political communication. \u201cBegin and Shamir were also racist. Even Rabin also said a few things that, if they were said against Jews in the U.S. or the U.K., the whole world would be standing on its back feet. But Netanyahu has turned it into the center of the campaign.\u201d\nMr. Netanyahu\u2019s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe prime minister\u2019s haranguing against Arabs and their parties was so conspicuous that a popular Israeli model and television host, Rotem Sela, took Mr. Netanyahu to task, writing on Instagram that \u201cthe Arabs are also human beings,\u201d that \u201call people are born equal,\u201d and that \u201cthis is a country of all its citizens.\u201d\nTo which Mr. Netanyahu responded with a fresh affront, saying matter-of-factly that Israel was decidedly not a state of all its citizens. \u201cIsrael is the nation-state of the Jewish people \u2014 and not anyone else,\u201d he said, adding a day later that Israel\u2019s \u201cArab citizens have 22 nation-states around them and they do not need another.\u201d\nAgain, the implication was clear: \u201cIt means he\u2019s depicting Arab citizens not only as second-class, but as traitors, as a fifth column, as illegitimate,\u201d Mr. Jamal said.\nThe barbs seem to be taking a toll on the Druze, an Arab ethnic group whose members serve in the Israeli army, prize their loyalty to the state and had been a source of significant support for Mr. Netanyahu. More than half of likely Druze voters are now backing Mr. Gantz, Mr. Telhami said, and Druze support for right-wing parties as a whole \u2014 already exceptional among Arabs \u2014 has plunged to less than 20 percent from around twice that.\n\u201cWe are very disappointed,\u201d said Manal Birani, 47, a Hebrew and math teacher in Daliyat al-Karmel, a Druze town near Haifa. \u201cVery angry. I hope that Gantz will win. When he says, \u2018I\u2019m against the nation-state law and I\u2019ll help you to change it,\u2019 he wants to change it.\u201d\nBut many Arabs say they cannot root for Mr. Gantz, who announced his candidacy with ads trumpeting the numbers of \u201cterrorists\u201d he had killed as army commander during the 2014 war in Gaza.\n\u201cGantz started his campaign with a confession of war crimes,\u201d said Majd Kayyal, a 28-year-old novelist living in Haifa. He said he would not vote: \u201cI don\u2019t care with what instrument I will be oppressed.\u201d\nIn Umm al-Fahm, a hilly town of 54,000 in the so-called Northern Triangle of heavily Arab Israel, residents complain that violent crime receives little attention and the police do little except hand out traffic tickets.\n\u201cWhen it\u2019s a Muslim Arab killing another Muslim Arab, there\u2019s nothing done,\u201d said Raja Mahmeed, 37, a fishmonger in a crowded strip mall. \u201cThis all comes from the Israeli politics \u2014 \u2018Let them kill each other,\u2019\u201d he said.\nMr. Mahmeed said he would vote either for an Arab party or for Meretz, a left-wing party that put up big billboards in the center of town.\nBut others, disillusioned by Arab political infighting, say they are sitting out the election. \u201cIt\u2019s useless,\u201d said Samir Mahmeed, 37, a barber shop manager from the same extended family. \u201cWho would I choose? I want to choose someone who works for the Arab community, for Umm al-Fahm. No one\u2019s doing anything for the Arabs.\u201d\nThe practical consequence is that Arabs who abstain \u2014 either out of support for a boycott or frustration with the options \u2014 are likely to benefit Mr. Netanyahu.\nPerhaps the most poignant finding in Mr. Telhami\u2019s new survey was the steady increase in the number of Arabs identifying themselves as Israeli first, rather than Arab, Palestinian or Muslim. That number has been steadily ticking up, to 17 percent, from 12 percent in 2011.\nAt the same time, other polls have shown that nearly half of Israeli Jews would favor expelling all Palestinians, and a large majority believes Jews should have privileges that Arabs do not.\n\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking,\u201d Mr. Telhami said. \u201cJust as Arabs are getting to be more and more Israeli, the Jews want them to be less Israeli.\u201d\nRaja Mahmeed, the fishmonger, said he considered himself both an Israeli and a Palestinian Israeli.\n\u201cBelieve me, the people themselves, in the market, in the street, we and the Jews live together,\u201d he said. \u201cOur problem is just with Netanyahu, the extreme right wing. If we could just have them leave the government, we could live in peace.\u201d", "date": "March 20, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/20/world/middleeast/netanyahu-arabs-election.html", "tags": "\u201c israel say hectored netanyahu israeli arabs could final arab"}
