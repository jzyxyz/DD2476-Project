Is in \u2018Tatters\u2019", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 As the F.B.I.\u2019s Russia investigation draws closer to him, President Trump on Sunday unleashed an extraordinary assault on the nation\u2019s premier law enforcement agency, calling it a biased institution whose reputation for fairness was \u201cin tatters.\u201d\nIn a series of early-morning tweets, Mr. Trump said the F.B.I.\u2019s standing was now the \u201cworst in history.\u201d The attack was one of the harshest in a generation on an independent agency that two days earlier had helped secure a guilty plea and a pledge of cooperation from the president\u2019s first national security adviser.\nCurrent and former F.B.I. officials, historians and lawmakers rebuked the president over his efforts to undermine the F.B.I.\u2019s credibility as it investigates whether his campaign colluded with Russian officials to sway the 2016 election. A president who has positioned himself as devoted to law and order is now in a public dispute with the country\u2019s top law enforcement agents.\nThomas O\u2019Connor, the president of the association representing F.B.I. agents, defended their integrity in a statement. \u201cF.B.I. agents are dedicated to their mission,\u201d he said, asserting that they demonstrated \u201cunwavering integrity and professionalism\u201d on the job. \u201cSuggesting otherwise is simply false,\u201d he added.\nOn Friday, Michael T. Flynn, the former national security adviser, admitted that he had lied to the F.B.I. about his conversations with the Russian ambassador during the presidential transition. As part of the bureau\u2019s inquiry, the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, is believed to be examining whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice by firing James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, who was overseeing the inquiry. Mr. Comey has said Mr. Trump asked him to drop the investigation into Mr. Flynn.\nBut on Sunday, the president condemned Mr. Comey as a liar, saying that \u201cI never asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn\u201d and that Mr. Comey had harmed the bureau and its employees. He also accused the bureau\u2019s agents of spending years pursuing a \u201cphony and dishonest\u201d investigation into the email server of his 2016 rival, Hillary Clinton.\nMr. Trump\u2019s fury at those investigating him stunned even those with fresh memories of his repeated attempts over the past year to disparage intelligence agencies, the State Department and other parts of his government. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said the frenzied nature of the president\u2019s tweets suggested that he knew that Mr. Mueller was building an obstruction of justice case against him.\n\u201cI see it in the hyper-frenetic attitude of the White House, the comments every day, the continual tweets,\u201d Ms. Feinstein said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday.\nEric H. Holder Jr., who was President Barack Obama\u2019s first attorney general, responded to the president\u2019s tweets with one of his own defending the bureau. \u201cYou\u2019ll find integrity and honesty at FBI headquarters and not at 1600 Penn Ave right now,\u201d Mr. Holder wrote.\nAs he sought to discredit the Russia inquiry, which he has long called a political \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d Mr. Trump on Sunday seized on reports that Mr. Mueller had removed a veteran F.B.I. agent because he sent text messages that appeared to express views critical of Mr. Trump.\nIn several tweets, the president harshly criticized the agent, Peter Strzok, who had previously helped lead the 2016 investigation into whether Mrs. Clinton had mishandled classified information on her private email account. Mr. Strzok is considered one of the bureau\u2019s most experienced and trusted counterintelligence investigators.\n\u201cReport: \u2018ANTI-TRUMP FBI AGENT LED CLINTON EMAIL PROBE,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump said in his 10th tweet on Sunday, which by the early evening had been retweeted more than 24,000 times. \u201cNow it all starts to make sense!\u201d\nMost presidents enter the Oval Office with an instinct to defend and promote the integrity and capabilities of the nation\u2019s law enforcement agencies. Mr. Trump arrived with a different compulsion, fueled by a belief that intelligence and law enforcement officials were stoking questions about the legitimacy of his election victory.\nBy suggesting \u2014 as he has before \u2014 that the F.B.I. and other agencies are motivated by politics, Mr. Trump again embraced the kind of suspicions that feed conspiracy theories about a \u201cdeep state\u201d operating with a secret bias against him.\nStill, even though Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on government agencies are now a familiar theme, former F.B.I. officials and veteran observers of the agency said they were surprised at the ease with which the president sought to defend himself by attacking the reputations of Mr. Comey, Mr. Mueller, Mr. Strzok and the 35,000 people who work at the F.B.I.\nRobert E. Anderson Jr., a former top spy hunter at the bureau, said the president\u2019s comments would have a dispiriting effect on F.B.I. morale, especially among those who are not involved in political investigations.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got men and women working tirelessly in every corner of this world to protect the United States and its people,\u201d Mr. Anderson said. \u201cWhen he says what he says, it\u2019s an insult and it\u2019s degrading to the men and women who are sacrificing their lives to protect this great nation.\u201d\nMr. Anderson also came to the defense of Mr. Strzok, calling him \u201cone of the most methodical, most meticulous, hard-working counterintelligence experts in the entire United States intelligence community.\u201d Mr. Anderson said Mr. Strzok \u201cnever displayed political bias.\u201d\nThe president retweeted a Twitter post urging Christopher A. Wray, the current F.B.I. director, to \u201cclean house\u201d at the agency. In a statement on Sunday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said he had directed Mr. Wray to \u201creview the information available on this and other matters and promptly make any necessary changes.\u201d\nMr. Trump has repeatedly described the F.B.I. as an agency in turmoil, often blaming Mr. Comey \u2014 a \u201cshowboat\u201d and a \u201cgrandstander\u201d \u2014 for losing support among rank-and-file agents. He cited such supposed turmoil when he fired Mr. Comey in May. But several years of internal employee surveys by the F.B.I. undercut that claim, showing that employees gave Mr. Comey high marks for his leadership.\nAnd since taking over four months ago, Mr. Wray has repeatedly praised the bureau\u2019s work force. In a speech in October, Mr. Wray described the bureau\u2019s employees as \u201coutstanding and dedicated.\u201d\n\u201cI wake up every day fired up to come to work \u2014 to be part of this extraordinary group \u2014 and to see where we can go next,\u201d he said.\nMr. Trump\u2019s efforts to shift attention away from Mr. Flynn\u2019s guilty plea began Saturday night, when he assailed the Justice Department for its handling of the Clinton email investigation and questioned the department\u2019s dedication to living up to its name.\n\u201cMany people in our Country are asking what the \u2018Justice\u2019 Department is going to do about the fact that totally Crooked Hillary, AFTER receiving a subpoena from the United States Congress, deleted and \u2018acid washed\u2019 33,000 Emails?\u201d he wrote, referring to messages that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s lawyers had deemed unrelated to her government work. \u201cNo justice!\u201d\nIn another tweet Saturday night, Mr. Trump accused the F.B.I. of destroying Mr. Flynn\u2019s life for his lying to agents, while letting \u201cCrooked Hillary Clinton\u201d off easy for what he said were her own lies to agents. \u201cRigged system, or just a double standard?\u201d he said.\nBut Mr. Trump appears to remain especially fixated on Mr. Comey, who testified  before Congress in June that the president had asked him to drop the inquiry into Mr. Flynn\u2019s activities one day after Mr. Trump had fired Mr. Flynn. Mr. Comey declined to do so, and the president fired Mr. Comey several months later.\nIn one tweet on Sunday, Mr. Trump blamed \u201cyears of Comey\u201d at the helm of the F.B.I. for what he views as the damage to its reputation.\n\u201cAfter years of Comey, with the phony and dishonest Clinton investigation (and more), running the FBI, its reputation is in Tatters \u2014 worst in History!\u201d Mr. Trump wrote. \u201cBut fear not, we will bring it back to greatness.\u201d\nThe tweet drew a sharp rebuke from Mr. Holder. \u201cThe FBI\u2019s reputation is not in \u2018tatters,\u2019\u201d Mr. Holder wrote on Twitter. \u201cIt\u2019s composed of the same dedicated men and women who have always worked there and who do a great, apolitical job.\u201d", "date": "Dec. 3, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/03/us/politics/trump-fbi-tatters.html", "tags": "guilty \u2018 f.b.i \u201c comey plea bureau trump says flynn defending tatters \u2014"}
