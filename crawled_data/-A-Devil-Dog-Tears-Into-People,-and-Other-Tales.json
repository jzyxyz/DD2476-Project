{"title": " A Devil Dog Tears Into People, and Other Tales", "content": "Even if you\u2019re pleased to be living during the golden age of television, you might find yourself overdosing on oversexed political soap operas or noir detectives with anguished back stories. For those moments when you want something a little different \u2014 well, more than a little different \u2014 there\u2019s Adult Swim, which this week adds two new shows to its catalog of late-night, 15-minute transgressions against coherence and good taste.\nThe less tasteful but more mainstream of the two is the animated \u201cMr. Pickles\u201d on Sunday night, about a smiling, preternaturally cheerful pet collie who likes pickles and happens to be the devil \u2014 not in the sense of barking too much or tearing up the garden, but in the sense of tearing people\u2019s entrails out or herding them into fetish orgies. It\u2019s \u201cLassie\u201d (the dog\u2019s clueless 6-year-old master is Tommy instead of Timmy) done as a comic horror story in the Seth MacFarlane spirit (the dog can\u2019t keep his paws off Tommy\u2019s equally clueless mother). Only poor old Grandpa sees Mr. Pickles for what he really is. The overall effect is more grisly than funny, but a cult following seems ensured, and for added surreal-pop-culture cachet, Brooke Shields voices the mother.\nThe more interesting show makes its bow on Thursday night (actually very early Friday morning), when the comedy team of Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim returns to Adult Swim with \u201cTim & Eric\u2019s Bedtime Stories.\u201d More polished than their sketch series \u201cTim & Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!,\u201d \u201cBedtime Stories\u201d mimics the sort of dark tales of human nature that fill the schedule of reality channels like A&E and Investigation Discovery, turning them into absurd and creepy yet unsettlingly ordinary vignettes. It\u2019s like a postgraduate course in contemporary anti-comedy, and the episodes get funnier when you watch them a second time.\nThursday\u2019s premiere features Mr. Heidecker and Mr. Wareheim in a parody of the suburban-nightmare story of the psychotic neighbor. Next week\u2019s episode raises the stakes, with Bob Odenkirk starring in a risky comic take on a doctor who abuses his female patients while they\u2019re under anesthesia \u2014 in this case, he cuts off their toes, though it\u2019s with their consent. The story takes a lighter turn when the great character actor M. Emmet Walsh appears, playing a private eye who brings to mind his own character from \u201cBlood Simple.\u201d Things don\u2019t go so well for the doctor. Then Mr. Walsh\u2019s investigator turns to the doctor\u2019s young son and says, laconically but with feeling, \u201cI\u2019m your dad now.\u201d It\u2019s a small laugh, but I\u2019ll take it over one of Matthew McConaughey\u2019s monologues in \u201cTrue Detective.\u201d", "date": "Sept. 17, 2014", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/18/arts/television/mr-pickles-and-a-new-tim-eric-show-on-adult-swim.html", "tags": "people pickles eric devil story tim \u201d doctor tales dog stories \u2014 tears"}
