Presidential Vote Is a Test of Erdogan\u2019s Building Spree", "content": "ISTANBUL \u2014 From soaring bridges to a giant mosque to plans for the world\u2019s biggest airport, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey has used gargantuan building projects as an engine of growth and a signature way of leaving an indelible stamp on his nation.\nAs he campaigns for re-election on Sunday, Mr. Erdogan has promised his most ambitious project yet: a canal that would bisect the country and create a Turkish-owned trade route, which he says would make Turkey a great power and leave a legacy for the history books.\n\u201cWhat makes Panama is the Panama Canal,\u201d Mr. Erdogan told supporters at a rally in Istanbul last weekend. \u201cSuez is the biggest source of revenue for Egypt. Let\u2019s have a vote. God willing the Istanbul Canal will be another fresh breath for our city.\u201d\nThe election is shaping up as an up-or-down vote on how Mr. Erdogan has transformed Turkey during 15 years in charge. He has amassed sultanlike powers, jailed political enemies and trimmed civil liberties, even as average annual economic growth of 5 percent has spawned and nurtured a middle class.\nBut the most obvious way Mr. Erdogan has left his mark stands before the eyes of any visitor: grandiose monuments and infrastructure investments in just about every town.\nThere are signs that the public is weary of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s building mania. The canal is the latest dividing line between those who see Mr. Erdogan\u2019s projects as visionary, and those who say the works are guided by an insatiable construction industry that has enriched his ruling circle, raising questions about his management of a faltering economy.\nMr. Erdogan called the election a year and a half ahead of schedule, hoping to beat the economic downturn nipping at his heels. A once-fractured opposition has united against him, making it increasingly uncertain whether Mr. Erdogan will meet the 50 percent threshold to win outright and avoid a runoff against his top challenger.\nMr. Erdogan counts his building feats at virtually every election rally and warns that his opponents plan to tear down everything his Justice and Development Party, or A.K.P., has built. The party \u201cbuilt 284,000 classrooms,\u201d he declared recently in the town of Mugla, adding \u201cAre you going to demolish them too?\u201d\nHe lists his big canal project in first place on his campaign posters. Not one shovel has been put in the ground, but Mr. Erdogan has vowed to begin construction immediately if he is re-elected as president and assumes sweeping new powers.\nAll of his megaprojects have been about creating symbols of his strength as he aims for a place in the pantheon of great Turkish leaders, from the Ottoman sultans to the founder of the republic, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk.\nBut the 28-mile canal linking the Black Sea to the Sea of Marmara \u2014 estimated to cost $15 billion, though critics say the figure is closer to $65 billion, and displace some 800,000 people \u2014 has been dubbed his \u201ccrazy idea\u201d since Mr. Erdogan first conceived it seven years ago.\n\u201cIt means crazy, wow, in a good sense,\u201d said Mehmet Akarca, head of Turkey\u2019s general directorate for press and information and an adviser to the president. \u201cIt will make money, and ships will use it, and they will pay tolls to use it.\u201d\nThat is the hope, at least, though many doubt whether it will ever happen \u2014 or whether it will work if it does.\nEnvironmentalists warn that the canal would damage the ecosystem so much that Istanbul could become uninhabitable. Archaeologists caution that it would threaten a top-class Paleolithic site. Economists say the project is not financially viable.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like playing Moses,\u201d said Serkan Taycan, an artist and opponent of the canal who has mapped the area that would be disturbed.\nOzgur Unluhisarcikli, the Ankara director for the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a research organization, credits Mr. Erdogan for building infrastructure that has helped Turkey\u2019s rapid urbanization by linking cities to one another and to their suburbs. The construction sector has also provided millions of jobs to Turkey\u2019s largely uneducated work force.\n\u201cOne aspect of the big projects is that they are generating growth,\u201d Mr. Unluhisarcikli said.\nBut Mr. Erdogan\u2019s opponents say his economic model is dubious, even corrupt.\nAbdullatif Sener, a former deputy prime minister, has alleged that Mr. Erdogan\u2019s way of governing is all about the profit that the president and his close circle can gain in kickbacks.\nMr. Sener was a co-founder of the Justice and Development Party, as was Mr. Erdogan, but he resigned from the party in 2008 because of corruption, he says, and is now running for Parliament with the opposition Republican People\u2019s Party.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t think about the concerns of the citizens,\u201d Mr. Sener said of the government at a campaign rally in Aziziye, in central Turkey. \u201cThey think about \u2018How can I make my friend, my family, my close circle, my buddy richer.\u2019 With this mentality, this country could not escape disaster.\u201d\nMr. Erdogan has accused his opponents of peddling lies. \u201cWe invested billions in Istanbul, and now they say we robbed the country?\u201d he said last week at a rally in Istanbul. \nOthers criticize Mr. Erdogan for prioritizing construction over industry and trade, which would generate more income.\n\u201cWe are not using the resources in the best way to earn money,\u201d Durmus Yilmaz, a former chief of the Turkish central bank and a co-founder of a new opposition party, the Good Party, said in an interview at his home in Ankara.\n\u201cThis is all financed through foreign borrowing,\u201d he said. \u201cAre these investments generating enough income so we can pay back the loans?\u201d\nTurkish industry has shrunk since 2002, when Mr. Erdogan first came to power \u2014 to 16 percent of gross domestic product from 22 percent \u2014 and the construction sector has grown in its place.\nThe decline has left new ports and tunnels underutilized and Turkey lacking enough exports to finance its ballooning foreign debt, Mr. Yilmaz said.\nThen there are the extravagant projects \u2014 such as the presidential palace, four times the size of Versailles \u2014 that seem to be more about Mr. Erdogan\u2019s legacy than profitability.\nOn Istanbul\u2019s highest hill above the Bosporus, Mr. Erdogan is building the white marble Camlica mosque, appointing it with six minarets, the insignia of greatness.\nMany wonder if he plans to build a mausoleum for himself beside his project, as did the sultans of old.\n\u201cSome are white elephants, that\u2019s very clear,\u201d said Refet Gurkaynak, a professor of economics at Bilkent University in Ankara.\nThe government has said that growth has been more than 7 percent in the last two quarters, but the economy is already stumbling, Mr. Gurkaynak said.\n\u201cWe are in recession,\u201d he said, and \u201cwe are going to have a painful recession.\u201d\nHousing construction has reached its limit, and two million apartments are unsold in the country. Construction work is grinding to a halt, and companies are offering real estate on soft loans or barter.\nIn such a climate, Mr. Gurkaynak said, \u201cCanal Istanbul makes no sense whatsoever and will be impossible to finance.\u201d \nIt does not help that the proposed canal route would run parallel to the Bosporus, where transit is free under the 1936 Montreux Convention.\nOfficials insist there will be enough traffic to make the canal profitable. But Mr. Gurkaynak and others argue that shippers would be unlikely to pay when there is a free passage a few miles away.\nNew oil and gas pipelines are already reducing tanker traffic through the straits, according to a report by Istanbul\u2019s Chamber of Environmental Engineers.\nThe looming pitfalls are familiar. Two of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s much vaunted bridges \u2014 the Osman Gazi Bridge over the Gulf of Izmit, and the Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge, which spans the Bosporus \u2014 have little traffic partly because of the high tolls charged. The government is paying the shortfall.\nMr. Akarca, the presidential adviser, defended the projects\u2019 financing system, which has been mostly a variety of public-private partnerships.\n\u201cTurkey actually is not borrowing any money,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are the Turkish firms that are borrowing money; it is individual debt.\u201d\nBut the government has guaranteed the loans and the revenue, so some economists have said that the financing model is enriching private firms while saddling the country with debt.\nOther resistance to Mr. Erdogan\u2019s building spree is centered on the environment and conservation.\nTo the horror of archaeologists, Mr. Erdogan started the $4 billion Marmaray railway project beneath Istanbul\u2019s historic peninsula, and built a highway along the Byzantine city walls of a World Heritage site, over Unesco protests.\nResidents have pushed back against projects that have favored construction magnates, most prominently at the central Taksim Square, where huge protests exploded in May 2013 to save the park from commercial developers.\nThe protests, which left eight people dead and hundreds more injured, drew many citizens to oppose Mr. Erdogan\u2019s headlong drive to modernize Turkey\u2019s cities.\nYet instead of listening to them, Mr. Erdogan doubled down on his projects. Taksim became a symbol of his determination to impose his will.\n\u201cHe needed opponents and victories and symbols,\u201d said Mucella Yapici, an activist and a member of Istanbul\u2019s Chamber of Architects. \u201cTaksim is the most important.\u201d\nLast month, Istanbul\u2019s cultural center, an emblem of Ataturk\u2019s openness to the West, was pulled down at the site, and a vast domed mosque raised opposite it, dwarfing Ataturk\u2019s statue and robbing the square of its republican nature.\n\u201cThis is an attempt to erase the collective memory of the space,\u201d Ms. Yapici said.\nMuch more stands to be erased in the canal project \u2014 entire towns and villages, as well as the ecology of Istanbul\u2019s main water source.\nThe greatest concern is the potentially huge inflow of nutrient-rich water from the Black Sea, which scientists say would encourage the growth of algae and kill life in Sea of Marmara.\nThe Bosporus is so deep that it allows a countercurrent. The canal would have no such balancing effect.\nOne scientist has warned that Istanbul will come to stink of bad eggs from hydrogen sulfide. Other environmentalists warn that the vital wetlands used by migratory birds will be destroyed.\nThe government held a single meeting in March with landowners to introduce an environmental impact assessment. It claimed the canal would have negligible effect.\nIstanbul\u2019s Chamber of Environmental Engineers produced its own assessment, warning that the canal project \u2014 which includes plans for a new city for as many as three million people \u2014 would cause irreversible harm.\n\u201cIn the long run we will lose the Sea of Marmara and do damage to the Black Sea,\u201d said Sedat Durel, an environmental engineer who worked on the report.\nMr. Durel estimated that as many as 800,000 people would be displaced.\nThey include several thousand Crimean Tatars, refugees from the Crimean War who settled in the Sazlidere Valley west of Istanbul 150 years ago, after being granted the land by the sultan of the Ottoman Empire.\nTheir descendants, mostly farmers and factory workers, are anticipating with some dread any official orders to be uprooted again.\n\u201cOf course the canal is important,\u201d said Oktay Teke, the mayor of Sazlibosna, a village amid meadows beside the river. \u201cBut what about all these villages? What will happen?\u201d", "date": "June 21, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/21/world/europe/turkey-election-ergodan-canal-megaprojects.html", "tags": "turkey building \u201c istanbul canal spree presidential test vote erdogan \u2014"}
