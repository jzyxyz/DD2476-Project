{"title": "Iran sanctions: Rouhani condemns US 'psychological warfare'", "content": "Iran's President Hassan Rouhani has hit out at the United States over its reinstatement of economic sanctions.\nHe described the measures, which came into effect overnight, as \"psychological warfare\" which aimed to \"sow division among Iranians\".\nThe sanctions take aim at various sectors, with further punitive action planned against Iran's oil trade. \nThe European Union has spoken out against the measures, vowing to protect firms doing \"legitimate business\".\nIt follows the US withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, also known as the Iran nuclear deal, earlier this year.\nThe deal, negotiated during the presidency of Barack Obama, saw Iran limit its controversial nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. \nUS President Donald Trump says the deal is \"one-sided\" and he believes renewed economic pressure will force Iran to agree to a new deal and end its \"malign\" activities. \nMr Trump signed an executive order which brought sanctions back into place at 00:01 EDT (04:01 GMT) on Tuesday. They target:\nA second phase is planned to come back into effect on 5 November which will have implications for Iran's energy and shipping sectors, petroleum trading and transactions by foreign financial institutions with the Central Bank of Iran.\nThe imposing of sanctions follows Mr Trump's withdrawal from the 2015 deal earlier this year. \nMr Trump had long spoken out against the agreement, labelling it \"disastrous\" and the \"worst deal I've ever seen\". \nOnly the US has withdrawn, with other signatories remaining committed to the original agreement.\nMr Trump says Iran faces a choice to \"either change its threatening, destabilising behaviour and reintegrate with the global economy, or continue down a path of economic isolation\".\n\"I remain open to reaching a more comprehensive deal that addresses the full range of the regime's malign activities, including its ballistic missile programme and its support for terrorism,\" Mr Trump said on Monday.\nMr Rouhani said the US government had \"turned their back on diplomacy\" with the action.\n\"They want to launch psychological warfare against the Iranian nation.\" Mr Rouhani said. \"Negotiations with sanctions doesn't make sense. We are always in favour of diplomacy and talks... but talks need honesty,\"\nHe also accused the Trump administration of using Iran as domestic political leverage ahead of November's midterm elections in the United States.\nThe foreign ministers of Germany, the UK and France released a statement on Monday that said the nuclear deal remained \"crucial\" to global security. \nThey also unveiled a \"blocking statute\" which is intended to protect European firms doing business with Iran despite the new US sanctions.\nAlistair Burt, the UK's minister of state for the Middle East, told the BBC: \"If a company fears legal action taken against it and enforcement action taken against it by an entity in response to American sanctions, then that company can be protected as far as EU legislation is concerned.\"\nHowever, German car and lorry maker Daimler, a major firm which announced a joint venture in Iran last year, confirmed this week that it has now ceased activities in the country.\nThe US had previously rejected calls to offer exemptions, with Mr Trump vowing \"severe consequences\" against firms and individuals who continued to trade with Iran.\nAn anonymous senior US official said that the administration was \"not particularly concerned\" by EU protection efforts.\nIran has seen unrest since last December over a poorly-performing economy.\nRising food prices, unemployment and even poor water supplies have led to protests in a number of cities.\nDemonstrations in Tehran in June were said to be the capital's biggest since 2012.\nHow much they are tied to the new US sanctions policy is hard to determine, but one definite link is the effect on Iran's currency. It lost around half of its value since Mr Trump announced the US withdrawal from the nuclear deal.\nIran acted to ease its foreign exchange rules on Sunday and the rial has since strengthened by 20%.\nIranians have been hoarding gold as a safeguard, pushing it to a record high in Tehran.\nThe sanctions may bite hardest in November, when the US blocks Iranian oil sales. \nThis could halt about half of Iran's exports of some two million barrels a day, although Iran may look to China and Russia to keep its industry afloat.\nThe International Monetary Fund said in March that Iran's net official reserves could decline this year to $97.8bn, which would finance about 13 months of imports. And analysts at BMI Research say Iran's economy could contract by 4.3% in 2019.\nHowever, Barbara Slavin, of the Future of Iran Initiative at the Atlantic Council, told the Wall Street Journal that when sanctions hit hard, it often means ordinary people become \"totally dependent\" on their government and so sanctions do not tend to topple regimes.", "date": "7 August 2018", "href": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-45092498", "tags": "sanctions iran us mr nuclear warfare rouhani year condemns action deal"}
