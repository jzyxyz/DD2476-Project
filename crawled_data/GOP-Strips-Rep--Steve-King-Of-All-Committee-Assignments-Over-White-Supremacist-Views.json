{"title": "GOP Strips Rep- Steve King Of All Committee Assignments Over White Supremacist Views", "content": "Republican leaders have stripped Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) of all of his committee assignments for the current Congress following a new wave of outcry over the lawmaker\u2019s vast history of white supremacist viewpoints and racist rhetoric.\n\u201cWe will not be seating Steve King on any committees in the 116th Congress,\u201d House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said Monday after a meeting of the GOP Steering Committee. The decision was unanimous.\nKing lambasted his removal\ufeff in a statement released late Monday, saying,\u00a0\u201cMcCarthy\u2019s decision to remove me from committees is a political decision that ignores the truth.\u201d\n\u201cUltimately, I told him \u2018You have to do what you have to do and I will do what I have to do,\u2019\u201d King wrote. \u201cI will continue to point out the truth and work with all the vigor that I have to represent 4th District Iowans for at least the next two years.\u201d\nAs HuffPost has extensively reported,\u00a0it was clear long before his recent comments that King is a white supremacist.\u00a0\nRepublicans made the move after a coalition of party leaders denounced King\u2019s long history of white nationalist views. The controversy was reignited last week after King gave an interview to The New York Times in which he asked: \u201cWhite nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization \u2014 how did that language become offensive?\u201d\nMcCarthy told reporters Monday that he was not removing King from the GOP House conference and said voters \u201chave that decision to make\u201d in terms of the lawmaker\u2019s future in the chamber.\n\u201cBut I think we spoke loud and clear that we will not tolerate this in the Republican Party,\u201d McCarthy said.\nHouse Democrats, who took control of the chamber this month, were pushing for intense sanctions against King, and McCarthy himself came out against the lawmaker, saying King\u2019s language had \u201cno place in America.\u201d\n\u201cThat is not the America I know, and it\u2019s most definitely not the party of Lincoln,\u201d McCarthy said.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) also denounced King, saying his statements were \u201cunwelcome and unworthy of his elected position.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t understand why \u2018white supremacy\u2019 is offensive, he should find another line of work,\u201d McConnell told The Washington Post.\nKing, who was elected to a ninth term in November, held seats on the House committees on agriculture, the judiciary and small business.", "date": "\n01/14/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/gop-steve-king-committee-assignments_n_5c3d2cd2e4b0e0baf54058bc", "tags": "steve strips committee lawmaker gop views white \u201d house supremacist assignments king rep- mccarthy decision"}
