{"title": "Arike Ogunbowale Strives for Greater Fame. But First, Another Title.", "content": "The ball was inbounded to Notre Dame guard Arike Ogunbowale. \u201cFour, three, two,\u201d came the shouts, counting down the expiring clock. Ogunbowale put up the shot \u2026 and \u2026 it was an air ball.\nNo matter. This happened last month, during a practice at the Joyce Center in South Bend, Ind., on the day before the Fighting Irish women\u2019s team played its regular-season finale. Notre Dame won that game, as it has won all but three games this year. It needs to win only two more to claim its second straight national championship; the first could come in the national semifinals Friday night, when Notre Dame (34-3) faces Connecticut (35-2).\n[Read our preview of the N.C.A.A. Women\u2019s Final Four here.]\nOgunbowale will be ready. Now a senior, she has made buzzer-beaters when they counted. Specifically, last year, in a sequence without precedent, Ogunbowale hit last-second shots to give her team victories in both the semifinals and the championship game.\nThe stunning nature of Ogunbowale\u2019s feats catapulted her to the kind of mainstream fame rarely bestowed on women\u2019s college basketball, which despite improved play and the introduction of a few more top programs has struggled to broaden its appeal.\nOgunbowale appeared on \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show,\u201d where Kobe Bryant greeted her as a surprise guest. She participated in the television competition \u201cDancing With The Stars.\u201d She won the ESPY Award for play of the year.\n\u201cShout out to women\u2019s basketball as a whole,\u201d she said in her acceptance speech. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people with their opinions about us, but all I got to say is, come see us on the court.\u201d\nIt was a telling moment: Even in triumph, winning out over other worthy nominees, mostly from men\u2019s sports, Ogunbowale chose to promote her game.\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a long way to go, which is why we have to advocate for ourselves,\u201d Ogunbowale said in an interview last month.\n\u201cI think our Final Four was super-exciting,\u201d she added, noting that the other semifinal had also gone to overtime, \u201cand that got people thinking, like, O.K., yeah, it\u2019s actually fun to watch.\u201d\nThe Final Four, and the response to it, illustrated just how intertwined the discussion of women\u2019s basketball is with a more meta discussion about women\u2019s basketball\u2019s popularity.\n\u201cIf Arike were on the men\u2019s side, you take that and roll with it,\u201d said Courtney Cox, a doctoral candidate at the University of Southern California who studies women\u2019s basketball. \u201cBut instead she has all this pressure to come back and do it again.\u201d\nIf it wins twice this weekend, Notre Dame would be only the fourth women\u2019s basketball team to repeat as national champion. And if Ogunbowale again plays a starring role, she seems as good a candidate as any to become the rare women\u2019s basketball star to have the kind of first-name status enjoyed by star athletes like Michael, Kobe, LeBron and Serena.\n\u201cThis notion of \u2018growing the game\u2019 is this phrase we hear a lot \u2014 W.N.B.A., college game,\u201d Cox said. \u201cBut I think the game is flourishing. Part of it is acknowledging the disparity that\u2019s already existed, the fact that the women\u2019s tournament has only existed on the N.C.A.A. level since 1982.\u201d\nThe college basketball establishment has changed several visible aspects of the women\u2019s game in an effort to increase its exposure. For instance, Ogunbowale\u2019s shots might have made a larger splash because they came on a Friday and a Sunday \u2014 the nights before the men\u2019s semifinals and title game \u2014 rather than the Sunday-Tuesday time slots that the women\u2019s Final Four had previously occupied.\nThat was one of several recommendations made in a paper that Val Ackerman, the first W.N.B.A. president, wrote for the N.C.A.A. in 2013 amid fears of declining attendance, stagnant ratings and a top-heavy women\u2019s tournament. Others included experimental rule changes, such as a 24-second shot clock and toying with a slightly lower rim; considering making women\u2019s basketball a one-semester sport; and even hosting the men\u2019s and women\u2019s Final Fours in the same city (or establishing a multiyear site for the women\u2019s event, much as Omaha always hosts the College World Series).\n\u201cThe visibility levels are a bit lower than they are in the men\u2019s,\u201d said Ackerman, who is now the Big East commissioner. \u201cIt\u2019s just one of the broader challenges.\u201d\nOf Ogunbowale, Ackerman added, \u201cThe aftermath of that championship for her proved that it can happen, when you have compelling performances on a national stage.\u201d\nThere is more than one kind of compelling, though. One of this season\u2019s more interesting moments also involved Ogunbowale and occurred when Connecticut visited Notre Dame for a nonconference game in December. During the game, which the Huskies won easily, Ogunbowale received a technical foul when she appeared to have words with Connecticut Coach Geno Auriemma \u2014 the latest spat between the two, who once subtweeted one another when Ogunbowale dropped UConn from her list of programs during recruiting.\nNeither Ogunbowale nor Notre Dame Coach Muffet McGraw would address the technical directly in interviews. But the argument that it was good for the game \u2014 that it resembled the drama that drives the N.B.A. news cycle \u2014 was made by the likes of the ESPN writer D\u2019Arcy Maine, who said, \u201cI\u2019m here for all the pettiness.\u201d\nMuch as the N.B.A. has ridden the personalities of its stars to greater popularity, women\u2019s basketball\u2019s growth will require what sports leagues have always needed: talented and charismatic stars.\n\u201cThe more we can do to get the casual fan to go, \u2018Oh, Notre Dame\u2019s playing \u2014 I\u2019m going to turn it on to see Arike,\u2019\u201d said McGraw, \u201cthe more interest, the more fans we\u2019ll get.\u201d\nCoincidentally or not, broadcasts of Notre Dame regular-season games on ESPN networks were up 12 percent over last year, according to a network spokeswoman.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not there yet,\u201d said Gregory Ogunbowale, Arike\u2019s father. \u201cArike and the others are trying to put it on the map. O.K., we\u2019re equally as good. As the father of a woman, I respect that. It\u2019s not all about dunking, it\u2019s about fundamentals, it\u2019s about skills, and they have all those.\u201d\nHe has noticed one difference, however. One of Arike\u2019s older brothers, Dare, is a running back who has played for Wisconsin and now a few N.F.L. teams. In the past, Gregory said, when teachers at the Milwaukee elementary school where he is the principal would ask about Dare, others would mention that his daughter was an athlete, too. Now, he said, it\u2019s the reverse.\n\u201cOne of my colleagues a couple weeks ago passed by my office and said, \u2018Hi, Arike\u2019s Dad,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI never heard that before.\u201d", "date": "April 4, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/sports/notre-dame-uconn-final-four-arike-ogunbowale.html", "tags": "game basketball title first notre fame ogunbowale greater strives \u201d one another dame women arike"}
