{"title": "Obama Joins Hillary Clinton on Stump, Saying She \u2018Has Been Tested\u2019", "content": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. \u2014 As Hillary Clinton braced for political fallout from her use of a private email server, President Obama delivered a stemwinder on her behalf on Tuesday, praising her \u201csteady judgment\u201d as his secretary of state and criticizing Donald J. Trump for his own lack of transparency.\nSleeves rolled up and declaring himself \u201cfired up\u201d on her behalf, Mr. Obama heaped admiration on Mrs. Clinton and assailed Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, saying American voters face a critical choice between \u201csome imaginary past, or whether we are going to reach for the future.\u201d\n\u201cI can tell you this, Hillary Clinton has been tested,\u201d Mr. Obama said as he interrupted repeatedly by the cheering crowd. \u201cThere has never been any man or woman more qualified for this office,\u201d the president boomed.\nBut the jubilant rally \u2014 Mr. Obama\u2019s first campaign appearance with Mrs. Clinton \u2014 unfolded at an awkward moment, just hours after the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, accused Mrs. Clinton of being \u201cextremely careless\u201d in her email use as he announced the end of an investigation that has engulfed her candidacy and put the Obama administration on the defensive.\nThe dueling political events on Tuesday were as discordant as they were separate: The president and his first-term secretary of state sidestepped the email issue at their rally, where Mr. Obama clasped hands with his onetime rival and predicted victory in the fall, making no mention of Mr. Comey\u2019s dramatic announcement in Washington faulting Mrs. Clinton even as he recommended against criminal charges.\nWithout mentioning the email controversy, Mr. Obama pointed to the political attacks that have chipped away at Mrs. Clinton\u2019s trust among voters. \u201cCan I be blunt?\u201d he said. \u201cHillary\u2019s got her share of critics.\u201d But, he added, \u201cThat\u2019s what happens when you dedicate yourself to public service over a lifetime.\u201d\nMr. Obama delicately touched on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s perceived weaknesses as a candidate even as he marveled at her tenacity in the nominating fight they waged against each other eight years ago. In an election year in which outsider candidates have railed against the establishment, Mr. Obama portrayed Mrs. Clinton\u2019s decades-long experience as a plus.\n\u201cSometimes we take somebody who has been in the trenches and fought the good fight and been so steady for granted,\u201d he said, recognizing that voters\u2019 yearning for the next new thing had helped his own 2008 campaign. \u201cWe don\u2019t do that, by the way, for airline pilots.\u201d\nAt a time when her State Department tenure is being picked apart by political critics, he defended her turn as the nation\u2019s top diplomat, noting how her popularity faded only once she returned to the political spotlight. \u201cIt\u2019s funny how the filter changes a little bit,\u201d he said. \u201cThe filter is a powerful thing.\u201d\nMrs. Clinton, perched on a stool behind the president, grinned and gently nodded.\nThe swing-state rally in North Carolina was rescheduled after a previous campaign event in Wisconsin was hastily canceled after the Orlando shootings. But in some ways, the moment had been years in the making.\nEight years ago, after a brutal primary fight, Mrs. Clinton appeared arm in arm with Mr. Obama for the first time in Unity, N.H., where she declared, \u201cUnity is not only a beautiful place, it\u2019s a wonderful feeling, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nMr. Obama referred to that event at Tuesday\u2019s rally in North Carolina, a rally that served as a kind of bookend to two remarkable careers that at times seemed destined to clash. \u201cWe went to Unity, N.H., just in case people missed the point,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cI saw the grace and the energy with which she threw herself into my campaign.\u201d\nMrs. Clinton spoke before the president, an unusual departure from how she appears at events with high-powered surrogates, and at times it felt like she was campaigning not for herself, but for Mr. Obama\u2019s legacy, praising his \u201cheart, depth and humility.\u201d\nShe repeatedly referred to their former rivalry, even praising Mr. Obama\u2019s political deftness at defeating her. \u201cHe knows a thing or two about winning elections, take it from me,\u201d she said.\nThe F.B.I.\u2019s decision not to recommend criminal charges came days after an unplanned, brief meeting between former President Bill Clinton and Attorney General Loretta Lynch at an airport in Phoenix. To avoid any appearance of political interference, Ms. Lynch said Friday that she would accept the recommendations of career prosecutors and the F.B.I. director on whether to bring charges against Mrs. Clinton.\nOn Saturday, Mrs. Clinton and her lawyers met with officials from the F.B.I. and the Justice Department to answer nearly four hours of questioning related to her email server.\nAides to both Democrats said Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton did not discuss the F.B.I. investigation on the flight to Charlotte. A spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, Nick Merrill, added that Mr. Obama looked at photos of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s grandchildren aboard Air Force One.\nServing as Mr. Obama\u2019s secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton engendered good will with the White House, and the experience of accepting Mr. Obama\u2019s offer to run the State Department became one of the most popular stories she relayed on the campaign trail, particularly when wooing black voters.\nMrs. Clinton also fired away at Mr. Trump, saying that Mr. Obama was \u201csomeone who has never forgotten where he came from \u2014 and Donald, if you\u2019re out there tweeting, it\u2019s Hawaii,\u201d a reference to Mr. Trump\u2019s calls in 2011 for the president to produce his birth certificate.\nFor several attendees, many of whom waited for hours in sweltering conditions to get into the rally, the chief draw was the chance to glimpse Mr. Obama as he sets off on something of a farewell tour.\nThe crowd was heavily African-American, flashing clothing and trinkets dedicated to the sitting president. Vendors sold tote bags and T-shirts emblazoned with images of Mr. Obama\u2019s teenage daughters, and T-shirts promising to continue Mr. Obama\u2019s historic 2008 victory by electing the first female president.\n\u201cIt was on my bucket list,\u201d Ivy Dunn, 69, said of seeing him.\nAsked if she thought Mrs. Clinton could be as effective in office, Ms. Dunn paused. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say yes,\u201d she said, \u201cbut she\u2019ll be good.\u201d\nMrs. Clinton will need to nurture Mr. Obama and his supporters, particularly after she strayed to the left of his policies during her nominating fight on issues like the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal and the Keystone XL Pipeline. A majority \u2014 51 percent \u2014 of Americans approve of the president, according to a recent Gallup poll.\nAs Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton touched down at the Charlotte airport, and strode off Air Force One together in a sign of solidarity, a reporter asked John D. Podesta, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman and a former White House chief of staff to Mr. Obama, whether the F.B.I. announcement overshadowed the rally.\nHe replied with a single word: \u201cHardly.\u201d", "date": "July 5, 2016", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/06/us/politics/hillary-clinton-obama.html", "tags": "saying \u2018 joins hillary clinton political \u201d rally obama stump mrs. tested said"}
