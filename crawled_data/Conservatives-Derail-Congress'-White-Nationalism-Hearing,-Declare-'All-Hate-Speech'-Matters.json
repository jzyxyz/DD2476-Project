{"title": "Conservatives Derail Congress' White Nationalism Hearing, Declare 'All Hate Speech' Matters", "content": "A congressional hearing on hate crimes and the rise of white nationalism was derailed by conservatives questioning whether white supremacy exists today at all, with some urging the committee to focus instead on \u201call hate speech.\u201d\nThe House Judiciary Committee had the perfect opportunity acknowledge the problem and attempt to address it at the source while questioning a panel of expert witnesses on extremism and hate in the country, as well as executives from Facebook and Google, whose platforms are under fire for amplifying that extremism.\nInstead, the floor was repeatedly given to conservative witness Candace Owens, a Trump-supporting Infowars and Fox News contributor who recently said Hitler would have been fine if he had simply remained a nationalist in Germany.\u00a0The focus of the meeting quickly shifted from the rising death toll in the name of white supremacy to Owens\u2019 main talking point: that discussing white nationalism at all is a Democratic ploy to win elections.\n\u201cThe hearing today isn\u2019t about white nationalism, it\u2019s a preview of a Democrat 2020 election strategy, same as the 2016 election strategy,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they were really concerned about white nationalism, they\u2019d hold hearings on Antifa.\u201d\nSuch a willfully ignorant statement disregards the white nationalist violence that others on the panel had been trying to bring attention to all morning: the recent shooting at two mosques in New Zealand that claimed 50 lives; the 2018 shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh; the deadly Unite the Right rallies in Charlottesville in 2017; the Emmanuel A.M.E. Church shooting committed by a white supremacist in 2015 and more.\u00a0\nBut Owens\u2019 talking point gave Republicans on the committee an avenue of deflection \u2015 a way of implying that Democrats, social media platforms and anyone else decrying white supremacy or demanding accountability are instead unfairly targeting conservative voices. One after another, Republicans bit on Owens\u2019 prompt, and one after the other, they proved they didn\u2019t come to talk about the rise in white nationalism at all.\nInstead, they victimized themselves. Rep. Louis Gohmert (R-Texas) asked a Facebook representative why the platform is so hard on \u201cmy friends, Diamond and Silk,\u201d referring to the pro-Trump social media stars. Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) complained Democrats showed \u201canimus\u201d by listing Owens as a \u201cconservative activist\u201d in the witness list, and said white supremacist hate crimes aren\u2019t worth focusing on.\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t that there isn\u2019t hate speech, it\u2019s that we need to condemn all hate speech,\u201d he said, to which Owens responded, \u201cI agree.\u201d\nRep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.) joked that Owens \u201ctriggers the left\u201d and suggested she shoot guns with him in Colorado sometime. A few chairs away sat Dr. Mohammad Abu-Salha, whose daughters and son-in-law were shot to death in a 2015 hate crime.\nThese exchanges turned into an argument over whether white supremacy exists and whether Owens plays a part in its proliferation, despite being a black woman. When Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) was given the floor, he used his phone to play back Owens\u2019 quote about Hitler becoming too global, which she said in February in front of members of conservative advocacy group Turning Point USA, of which she is the communications director.\u00a0\nAs Google and Facebook executives provided statements in the hearing, the comment section of a YouTube livestream of the meeting was disabled because of racist comments that\u00a0promoted neo-Nazi and white supremacist ideology almost exclusively.\nFacebook in particular has come under scrutiny in countries worldwide after the New Zealand shooting was livestreamed on the platform. As countries across the world sought to enact new rules that penalized platforms for allowing such material to live on their sites, Facebook unveiled a new rule banning white nationalism and separatism \u2015 a policy that was immediately debunked when a Facebook spokesperson told HuffPost a week later that prominent white nationalist Faith Goldy\u2019s content was not at all white nationalist.\nRep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) mentioned HuffPost\u2019s story\u00a0and asked what Facebook is doing to proactively ban white nationalist leaders. Neil Potts, the public policy director for Facebook, noted Goldy had eventually been banned, and that the platform was working to ban other white nationalists when it sees them.\nIn reality, Facebook has a hard time enforcing its own rules, even when extremist content is obvious.\nLast week, federal authorities charged a 22-year-old white supremacist who managed an extremist Facebook group. He and his cousin, the feds said, spoke admiringly of the Christchurch shooter and appeared to be plotting a similar attack. An FBI affidavit said that Facebook turned over information on the account on a \u201cvoluntary emergency disclosure\u201d basis. The Facebook account and white supremacist group \u2015 along with several other extremist Facebook groups with similar names \u2015 were still live when federal authorities unveiled the charges.\nAt the end of the day, the discrepancies in the platforms\u2019 action plans against white nationalist violence weren\u2019t pushed or adequately questioned by Congress. It was unclear whether some considered white supremacy an issue worth addressing at all.\nHuffPost reporters Ryan Reilly and Jen Bendery contributed to this report.", "date": "\n04/09/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/congress-held-a-hearing-on-white-nationalism-and-left-questioning-its-existence_n_5cacd268e4b043f7925c2995", "tags": "hearing supremacy hate speech derail declare matters nationalist owens white \u201d nationalism facebook conservatives congress"}
