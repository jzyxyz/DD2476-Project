Mr. Bonadio also ordered the freezing of assets of about $8.5 million each for Mrs. Kirchner and her son, and $6.5 million for her daughter.\nL\u00e1zaro B\u00e1ez, a construction tycoon in Patagonia who was detained last year in a separate money laundering case, and a casino magnate, Cristobal L\u00f3pez, were also indicted along with 16 others. They are all forbidden from leaving the country. The indictments can be appealed.\nThe two businessmen, along with associates, set up a system to \u201cillegally reimburse\u201d the presidential family for public works projects, Mr. Bonadio wrote in his ruling.\nThis is the latest in a series of cases that have engulfed Mrs. Kirchner since she stepped down from her two-terms as president in December 2015 and was succeeded by Mauricio Macri, a political opponent who faces critical midterm elections in November.\nA separate court is investigating allegations of kickbacks involving the renting of rooms in a hotel owned by the Kirchner family. The former president has also been indicted on fraud and corruption charges relating to public works projects in Santa Cruz province in southern Argentina.\nLast month, Mr. Bonadio ordered Mrs. Kirchner to stand trial on charges that she planned to defraud the government through the dollar futures market. And the country\u2019s highest criminal appeals court also called for an investigation into claims that Mrs. Kirchner sought to seal a secret deal with Iran relating to suspicions that it played a role in the 1994 bombing of a Jewish center in Buenos Aires.\nMrs. Kirchner has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, saying she is the victim of a judicial persecution orchestrated by the current administration.\nThe former president took to Twitter to characterize the indictment as nothing but the latest \u201cact\u201d in a series of \u201cmedia-judicial setups\u201d designed to distract the population from the country\u2019s current economic woes.\n\u201cI have no doubt that in the jurisprudential history of Argentina, there is no ruling that is more unfounded,\u201d An\u00edbal Fern\u00e1ndez, Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s former cabinet chief, said.\nBut Margarita Stolbizer, an opposition lawmaker who helped initiate the investigation into the real estate company, celebrated the ruling, writing on Twitter that \u201cwe are starting to regain trust in the judiciary.\u201d", "date": "April 4, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/world/americas/argentina-cristina-fernandez-de-kirchner-corruption-indictment.html", "tags": "bonadio kirchner former \u201d charges indicted children ex-president also mrs. argentina"}
