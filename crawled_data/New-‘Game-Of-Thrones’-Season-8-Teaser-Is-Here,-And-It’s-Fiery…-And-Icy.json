{"title": "New \u2018Game Of Thrones\u2019 Season 8 Teaser Is Here, And It\u2019s Fiery\u2026 And Icy", "content": "A battle between fire and ice is coming.\nOr at least that\u2019s what is implied in the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d Season 8 teaser that\u00a0HBO\u00a0released Thursday.\nThe 39-second animated clip shows ice and fire sweeping over a map of Westeros. A figure of a direwolf is covered in ice (probably representing House Stark), then a miniature dragon is frozen (a reference to House Targaryen or possibly zombie dragon Viserion). Fire engulfs a lion figure (a nod to House Lannister), and at the end of the clip, the two elements clash in the middle, likely representing a pretty epic battle in the series\u2019 final season. That, or the PR team at HBO is really harping on the whole \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire\u201d thing (the name of the book series that the show is based on) before the series concludes.\nThe teaser also confirms the next season will premiere in April 2019.\nIn the previous season of \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d Jon Snow (Kit Harington) and Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) decided to join forces (and their loins) to defeat the White Walkers. But Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey) is still ruling the Seven Kingdoms and is hellbent on keeping her power despite threats from snow-dwelling, baby-stealing monsters and another pair of\u00a0incestuous\u00a0star-crossed lovers.\nCheck out the clip above!", "date": "\n12/06/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/game-of-thrones-season-8-trailer_n_5c099f66e4b0b6cdaf5d66d2", "tags": "teaser \u2018 game fire ice clip icy thrones season series battle \u201d fiery\u2026 house new"}
