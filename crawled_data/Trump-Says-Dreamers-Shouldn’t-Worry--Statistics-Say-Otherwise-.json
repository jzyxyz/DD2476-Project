{"title": "Trump Says Dreamers Shouldn\u2019t Worry- Statistics Say Otherwise-", "content": "AUSTIN, Texas \u2015 President Donald Trump offered words of reassurance to Dreamers on Friday, telling the Associated Press that he didn\u2019t intend to deport the undocumented youths who qualify to remain in the country. \nTrump said his administration is \u201cnot after the Dreamers, we are after the criminals,\u201d according to AP, adding that undocumented youths with permission to work legally should \u201crest easy.\u201d \nBut even as he pledged that Dreamers and law-abiding immigrants without papers should stop worrying, data released Friday by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse undermined his claims. \nTRAC\u2019s preliminary review of court records under Trump\u2019s first two months in office showed that the number of people detained while their deportation cases proceed more than doubled, from 27 percent of the total to 61 percent. \u00a0\nNearly 26,000 people were served with Notices to Appear in immigration court \u2015 the first step in deportation cases \u2015 from Trump\u2019s inauguration in late January through March. That figure amounts to roughly the same pace as in the final months of the Obama administration. \nBut unauthorized border crossings have plummeted since Trump took office. That means a larger share of the people winding up in deportation proceedings were arrested from within the interior of the country and likely lived here for years \u2015 a major shift that\u2019s already ensnaring more people without serious criminal records into the removal system. \n\u201cInterior enforcement has increased,\u201d Muzaffar Chishti, who directs the New York office of the non-partisan Migration Policy Institute, told HuffPost. \u201cThat means now, more longer-term established residents are now going to be picked up than people who just crossed the border yesterday. That\u2019s a significant change in the kinds of people you are removing.\u201d \nIn the last two years of the Obama administration, deportations dropped from record highs \u2015 partly because unauthorized border crossings also dropped and partly because the administration often declined to deport undocumented immigrants already living in the U.S. without serious criminal records or previous deportations. \nAn Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman called the TRAC study \u201cmisleading and vague,\u201d in an emailed statement, but affirmed that the agency has widened its net under Trump. \u201cICE focuses its enforcement resources on individuals who pose a threat to national security, public safety and border security,\u201d the statement said. \u201cHowever, as Secretary Kelly has made clear, ICE will no longer exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement.\u201d\u00a0\nThe average daily population in immigrant detention as of April 8 was 40,467, according to ICE \u2015 slightly lower than when Trump took office. \nEven before the TRAC data became available, The Washington Post reported this week that the number of people without criminal records deported under Trump through March doubled to 5,441. \nSuch people were often allowed to check in with ICE and delay their deportations in former President Barack Obama\u2019s final years. In the last months of Obama\u2019s administration, more than half of those served with a Notice to Appear in immigration court never saw the inside of a detention center, according to TRAC. \nBut within weeks of Trump taking office, ICE began detaining and removing people at their check-ins. Those arrests show immigration authorities under Trump are going after \u201clow-hanging fruit,\u201d according to former ICE Director John Sandweg. People checking in with ICE have normally exhausted all their appeals to stay in the country, so ICE can deport them more swiftly. \nAnd under Trump, ICE has already arrested several beneficiaries of the 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which allows undocumented immigrants who came to the country as youths to work and reside legally in the country for a renewable two-year period. On Feb. 17, Border Patrol summarily removed Juan Manuel Montes, a 23-year-old Mexican national shielded by DACA through 2018.\nNone of these trends make Dreamers feel safe.\n\u201cI\u2019m certainly not resting easy,\u201d Karla P\u00e9rez, a leader with the immigrant rights group United We Dream, who holds DACA, told The Huffington Post. \u201cJust this week, a DACA-mented person, Juan Manuel Montes, was deported from his family.\u201d\u00a0\nP\u00e9rez pointed out that the Trump administration and many state and local governments are working together to expand the detention and deportation system. \nIn Texas, where she lives, the state legislature is set to vote next week on Senate Bill 4, a law that would ban all jurisdictions from enacting \u201csanctuary\u201d policies by declining to hold undocumented immigrants who qualify for release in local jails on behalf of immigration authorities. And more than a dozen local jurisdictions in Texas have applied for 287(g) agreements, which allow police to perform some immigration enforcement functions normally reserved for the federal government. \n\u201cIt\u2019s important that people don\u2019t lull themselves into thinking, \u2018Oh I have DACA, I\u2019m safe,\u2019\u201d P\u00e9rez said. \u201cProposals like Texas SB 4 will make all of us unsafe, including those of us that do have DACA. \u201d \nJuan Escalante, who works as a digital organizer for the advocacy group America\u2019s Voice and who also holds DACA, said he isn\u2019t taking Trump at his word.\n\u201cEven with those promises that he won\u2019t go after DACA-mented youth, that\u2019s not the case,\u201d Escalante said.\nEven if the Trump administration left DACA beneficiaries alone, Escalante said, many face bureaucratic obstacles, like coming up with $495 for their application renewal or getting it through the backlogged U.S. Immigration and Citizenship Services system in time to avoid a lapse in coverage that would leave them more vulnerable to deportation. \n\u201cEveryone has to do what they\u2019ve always been told to do \u2015 know your rights, make a plan,\u201d Escalante said. \u201cThis is only a couple months into the administration. Who knows what\u2019s going to happen in a couple of years.\u201d", "date": "\n04/21/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-says-dreamers-shouldnt-worry-statistics-say-otherwise_n_58fa76a9e4b06b9cb916faaa", "tags": "people administration immigration ice worry- otherwise- daca statistics \u201d trump \u2015 say says dreamers"}
