{"title": "North Carolina Fails To Repeal Anti-LGBTQ Bill", "content": "What was supposed to be a smooth repeal of North Carolina\u2019s anti-LGBTQ law fell apart Wednesday as Democrats said Republicans backed out on a deal to put forward a clean repeal bill. The General Assembly voted to adjourn its special session after more than nine hours with the law still on the books.\u00a0\nHB2 barred cities and localities from enacting anti-discrimination policies that protect people on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity; it also prevented schools from allowing transgender students to use the restroom that corresponds with their gender identity rather than the gender assigned to them at birth.\u00a0\nRepublican Gov. Pat McCrory and Republican lawmakers pushed HB2 through the state legislature after Charlotte passed a nondiscrimination ordinance protecting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people.\u00a0\nBut there have been significant changes in the state since then. Businesses have pulled their jobs and events out of the state, McCrory lost his re-election to Democrat Roy Cooper and Republicans are sick of having to deal with the national uproar.\u00a0\nOn Monday, Charlotte\u2019s city council also voted unanimously to rescind its nondiscrimination ordinance under the promise that the General Assembly would then move to repeal HB2.\u00a0\nIn response to Charlotte\u2019s move, McCrory called the legislature back for a special session Wednesday.\nDemocrats said Wednesday that they were expecting a clean repeal bill. But instead, Sen. Phil Berger, the GOP leader of the chamber, put forward a measure that would set a six-month \u201ccooling-off\u201d period during which time localities would be barred from making changes to their ordinances on issues of employment and public accommodations. In other words, HB2 would essentially be in effect for another six months. The measure could also have tied the hands of localities looking to change ordinances on issues like the minimum wage.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that helps us get to a reset so that to the extent you think we\u2019ve done the right thing or the wrong thing, you think Charlotte has done the right thing or the wrong thing, it gives everyone an opportunity to start over,\u201d Berger said on the Senate floor Wednesday afternoon. \u201cYou don\u2019t get those chances very often.\u201d\nHe added that it would allow the General Assembly to work on a \u201clong-range solution\u201d to the issues, although it\u2019s unclear what that would be.\u00a0\nDemocrats, however, came out against the GOP bill.\nState Sen. Floyd McKissick (D) took to the floor and said his fear was that the six-month period would continually be extended, meaning HB2 would essentially be left in place. \u00a0\nRepublicans similarly said they felt betrayed by Democrats. The Charlotte City Council\u00a0didn\u2019t repeal the entire ordinance\u00a0Monday; it left in place a few provisions \u2015 including one barring contractors from discriminating on the basis of gender identity. Republicans balked when they found out, and the council reconvened Wednesday, voting 7-2 to repeal the entire ordinance.\nLate Tuesday night, the North Carolina GOP put out a statement blasting Cooper and politicians in Charlotte for their move.\u00a0\nAnd there were some Republicans who didn\u2019t want to see any repeal at all; Republican legislators spent hours meeting behind closed doors to figure out how to move forward. North Carolina Lt. Gov. Dan Forest (R) put out a statement Wednesday saying he opposed repeal efforts \u2015 despite the turmoil and economic hit the state has taken.\n\u201cNo economic, political or ideological pressure can convince me that what is wrong is right,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will always be wrong for men to have access to women\u2019s showers and bathrooms.\u201d\nLate Wednesday evening, Berger divided his bill into two parts \u2015 one for full repeal and one on the moratorium \u2015 with votes on each. If either part failed, the entire repeal effort failed.\u00a0The first part failed, meaning the repeal legislation was dead. The Senate then voted to join the House in adjourning.\nBerger blamed Cooper for the defeat.\n\u201cMake no mistake: Roy Cooper and Senate Democrats killed the repeal of HB2, abandoning Roy Cooper\u2019s commitment to avoid divisive social issues by shooting down a temporary cooling off period on ordinances like the one that got us into this mess last March,\u201d he said in a statement Wednesday evening.\u00a0\n\u201cAs promised, I called a Special Session to reconsider a manufactured political issue that strategically targeted the city of Charlotte and our state by well-funded left-wing interest groups. This was at least the third time that pressure from the left sabotaged bipartisan good faith agreements for political purposes,\u201d McCrory added in his own statement.\nCooper said he was deeply disappointed over the \u201cbreach of trust\u201d with Republicans.\nEven with the repeal of HB2, North Carolina\u2019s LGBTQ community would be left without protections. The state still has no protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.\u00a0\nIn a statement Monday, Cooper indicated that he would push for equality when he takes office as governor in the new year.\u00a0\nStill, much of the reaction was negative this week to Charlotte agreeing to rescind its ordinance in a deal with the state legislature. Mayor Jennifer Roberts (D) defended the move, saying it\u00a0\u201cshould in no way be viewed as a compromise of our principles or commitment to non-discrimination.\u201d\n\u201cThey made a calculated guess about whether this was going to work,\u201d said James Esseks, director of the ACLU\u2019s LGBT and HIV Project. \u201cAnd if it doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019m sure they\u2019re going to have a lot of regrets, because they will have taken protections away from the citizens of Charlotte and gotten nothing in return. That is a sad day. It seems awful hard to do political business in North Carolina. That\u2019s for sure.\u201d\nThe city of Charlotte issued a statement Wednesday night saying it had \u201cacted in good faith\u201d to facilitate the repeal of HB2 and remained committed to \u201cmaintaining and protecting diverse and inclusive communities.\u201d\nThe ACLU, along with Lambda Legal, is also challenging the constitutionality of HB2 in court, with a ruling expected from a federal appeals court next year.\n\u201cSo this law, I think, is going to go away one way or another,\u201d Esseks said. \u201cIt would be much better if the legislature simply got rid of it now so people don\u2019t have to wait any longer for justice.\u201d\nBusinesses and corporations, which often go further than governments in their pro-LGBTQ policies, have been very critical of HB2 and pushed North Carolina to repeal it. IBM tweeted its disappointment that the effort failed Wednesday night.\u00a0\nIn November,\u00a0Cooper defeated McCrory, whose loss was attributed in large part to the heat he took over HB2.\u00a0McCrory conceded on Dec. 5, after a month of wrangling and raising unproved theories\u00a0about fraud and other problems.\nIn response, the GOP-controlled legislature pushed through several bills\u00a0to take away powers from the incoming Democratic governor.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re now in a place where state legislatures around the country are going to convene in January or early in the year,\u201d Esseks said. \u201cAnd some of those people are thinking about doing, in essence, copycat bills like HB2. I think the message to all of them is, \u2018Really? Do you really want the kind of backlash that North Carolina has experienced?\u2019 And I hope that their answer is no.\u201d\nThis piece has been updated with additional reactions to the repeal effort.\n\u00a0\nWant more updates from Amanda Terkel?
