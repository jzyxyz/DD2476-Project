I fought. But still I was like, Why did I open that door?\"\nThe actress says Weinstein asked her to go to his hotel room under the guise of a business meeting, but appeared in a bathrobe and asked if he could give her a massage or if she could watch him shower.\nShe refused, and says he got revenge by seeking to damage her career.

It was a nightmare.\"\nLucia Evans - nee Stoller - encountered Weinstein in 2004 in a New York club when she was an aspiring actress. She says she was forced to perform oral sex by the producer after going to his office for what she thought was a casting meeting.\n\"The type of control he exerted, it was very real,\" she told The New Yorker. \"Even just his presence was intimidating.\"\nThe Boardwalk Empire star has accused Weinstein of raping her twice in New York in 2010.\nThe first time was after he offered her a ride home, and the second was when he turned up uninvited at her apartment. \"I did say no, and when he was on top of me I said, 'I don't want to do this',\" she said.\nPaltrow says Weinstein asked her to give him a massage in his hotel suite after casting her in the leading role of 1996's Emma when she was 22.\nShe refused. \"He screamed at me for a long time. It was brutal,\" she said. She told then boyfriend Brad Pitt - who threatened to kill the producer if he did anything like that to Paltrow again.\nFormer production worker Mimi Haleyi alleges that she was raped by Weinstein when he forcibly performed oral sex on her in 2006 in his New York apartment.\n\"I told him 'no, no, no'.

I stopped him and managed to get out of the room,\" she says.\nThe French actress has written about how he invited her to come to his hotel room for a drink.\n\"We were talking on the sofa when he suddenly jumped on me and tried to kiss me,\" she wrote in The Guardian. \"I had to defend myself. He's big and fat, so I had to be forceful to resist him.\"\nJolie says she was propositioned by Weinstein in a hotel room in 1998. \n\"I had a bad experience with Harvey Weinstein in my youth, and as a result, chose never to work with him again and warn others when they did,\" she said.\nThe Pulp Fiction actress says Weinstein pushed her down and \"tried to expose himself\" at the producer's hotel room in London during the 1990s. \n\"He tried to shove himself on me... He did all kinds of unpleasant things,\" Thurman said. \"But he didn't actually put his back into it and force me. You're like an animal wriggling away, like a lizard.\"\nThe Boogie Nights actress told Variety she was once propositioned by Weinstein in the early 2000s when she met him to discuss being cast in one of his movies.\nShe alleges he implied she had to sleep with him to get a film role, telling her that his wife would have been fine with it.\nThe model and actress says he asked for a massage in the south of France in 1997. She said: \"I didn't know what to do and I felt that letting him maybe touch me a little bit might placate him enough to get me out of there somehow.\"\nBefore long, she \"bolted\" into the bathroom.

She left.\nThe Splash actress says she repeatedly turned down Weinstein's advances during promotion for Kill Bill and its sequel. He tried, she says, to get into her hotel room on multiple occasions, once getting a key and \"burst[ing] in like a raging bull.\"  \nHe asked to grope her breasts and then asked her to expose herself to him, she alleges.
