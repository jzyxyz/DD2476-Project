W. Bush on Wednesday.\u00a0\nFootage from the event shows much of the church, including the former presidents seated with Trump, standing to recite the profession of faith.\u00a0\nTrump and first lady Melania Trump stood, but did not recite the creed, which was written in the program, nor did they sing the hymns.\u00a0\nGiven Trump\u2019s widespread support among evangelical Christians, that led to plenty of criticism on social media:\nCORRECTION: This article previously referred to the Apostles\u2019 Creed as a \u201cprayer\u201d; rather, it is a statement of belief.", "date": "\n12/06/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-apostles-creed_n_5c08d01ce4b0bf813ef4063c", "tags": "recited people creed definitely recite president twitter former every trump donald except calling apostles noticed"}
