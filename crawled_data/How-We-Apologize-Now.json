{"title": "How We Apologize Now", "content": "To be famous in 2019 one must possess (in addition to talent, or at least popularity) a patina of authenticity and a willingness to admit wrongdoing. Also: an iPhone. \nLady Gaga makes for a perfect case study. On Thursday, she sent an apologetic message to her more than 77 million Twitter followers. The singer wanted to let her Little Monsters know that, after renewed criticism of R. Kelly, she had decided to pull a track she had recorded with him in 2013 from streaming music services. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she wrote, her words cast against a grayish faux-paper background familiar to Apple users and celebrity news consumers, \u201cboth for my poor judgment when I was young, and for not speaking out sooner. I love you.\u201d\nHer statement was written using Notes, a free app that is preloaded onto Apple devices for the purpose of storing personal memories and to-do lists. In recent years, though, it has become the medium of choice for celebrity mass communication. \nThe reasons for writing these Notes notes vary, but oftentimes they are mea culpas for public errors. Armie Hammer apologized with a Notes app note for criticizing his peers for posting grief selfies after Stan Lee\u2019s death (\u201cI want to apologize from the bottom of my heart and will be working on my Twitter impulse control\u201d). Kendall Jenner apologized for her clothing line\u2019s insensitive use of the Notorious B.I.G.\u2019s and Tupac Shakur\u2019s likenesses (\u201cwe are huge fans of their music\u201d). Logan Paul apologized for videotaping a dead body in Japan (\u201cI intended to raise awareness for suicide and suicide prevention\u201d). Cardi B notably did not apologize for secretly marrying Offset (\u201cat least ya can stop saying i had a baby out of wedlock\u201d). Ariana Grande once apologized for licking a doughnut (\u201cI will strive to be better\u201d).\nOther public figures who have used Notes to make statements include Taylor Swift, Lena Dunham, Drake, Pete Davidson and Sarah Huckabee Sanders.\nPart of the medium\u2019s appeal is the ease with which its contents may be shared. Notes app apologies are screenshotted and dispersed, first on Twitter and Instagram, and then in entertainment news reporting. They are embedded into tabloid websites and quoted by magazines, as polished statements coming directly from publicists might be.\nZara Rahim, who handled publicity for Vogue before joining The Wing, a women\u2019s co-working space, as its communications director, said that the efficacy of these statements lies not only in their speed but also their appearance. \u201cI can just write this quick note on my Notes app, because it looks like I did it on my phone, have my publicist take a quick glance at it, if I\u2019m smart,\u201d she said, \u201cand then post it directly on my Instagram.\u201d\nSometimes statements include grammatical and spelling errors, or profanity, which function (perhaps unwittingly) as rhetorical devices, making the authors seem not only unpretentious but fallibly human. Their notes also frequently employ clich\u00e9s of spoken apologies: \u201cfrom the bottom of my heart,\u201d \u201cprofoundly,\u201d \u201cI wish I knew then what I know now,\u201d and so on. These tics foster the false sense of intimacy that most social media encourages. \nOf course, the marks of a direct-from-the source apology may come across as simply impulsive or careless. \u201cThe worst Notes app apologies are the ones that clearly were being written stream of consciousness and didn\u2019t get the edit, that were way, way, way too reactive to the point of where there are misspellings,\u201d Allison P. Davis, a pop culture reporter for New York Magazine, said.\nThere are also signs of possible fraudulence. After Taylor Swift said, in a Notes app statement directed at Kanye West and Kim Kardashian West, that she would \u201cvery much like to be excluded from this narrative,\u201d people seized on a minute detail of her shared screenshot: the \u201csearch\u201d icon in the upper left corner. Its presence suggested that the published note was one of many drafts she had carefully constructed with professional help, thus undercutting her attempt to appear off-the-cuff.\nThe best Notes app statements follow the same guiding principles of any good apology: get in and get out; be direct; don\u2019t try too hard to defend yourself; and (this is a bonus!) maybe say what you\u2019re doing moving forward. \u201cFolks are more likely to give you a second shot if you are just willing to say you made a mistake, and that you are going to do better,\u201d Ms. Rahim said.\nThe brevity of social media pushes most people toward a short and sweet statement. But when 280 characters doesn\u2019t quite cut it, Notes app, or whatever text keeper Androids come with, does the trick. (Jeff Bezos, who has been known to use BlackBerry and Samsung phones, released a divorce announcement this week that appeared to be formatted by a newspaper typesetter.) \nSharing a Notes app apology does have its pitfalls. If fans suspect an apology isn\u2019t as heartfelt or genuine as its straight-from-my-personal-device format implies, the entire thing could backfire. But even worse is a completely unapologetic apology. After the music-retreat-for-one-percenters known as Fyre Festival proved to be a scam, Ja Rule, its co-organizer, made sure to relinquish himself of blame: \u201cI truly apologize as this is NOT MY FAULT.\u201d \n\u201cYou want to avoid the Notes app spiral, long and short,\u201d Ms. Rahim said, referring to the age-old tendency to get defensive, blowing out what should be a simple \u201csorry\u201d into a long and winding tale of excuses.\nIf it seems like the trick to crafting a good Notes app apology isn\u2019t too different from the trick to crafting a regular old apology, that\u2019s because \u2014 surprise! \u2014 they\u2019re one and the same. A Notes app apology is just written in fear of (or, perhaps, in service of) going viral.", "date": "Jan. 12, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/12/style/notes-app-celebrity-statements.html", "tags": "notes statements \u201d app apologized apologize apology get also"}
