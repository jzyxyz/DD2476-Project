{"title": "The Latest Anti-Obamacare Lawsuit Is Both Bonkers And Dangerous", "content": "The latest legal assault on the Affordable Care Act is downright laughable,\u00a0but the consequences would be deadly serious if it succeeded.\u00a0\nPresident Donald Trump and congressional\u00a0Republicans failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act last year despite making a real go at it, and conservative activists and state officials failed in two previous attempts to get the Supreme Court to overturn or upend the law. Now they\u2019re trying again to get the judiciary to do their dirty work for them.\nThe Trump administration is now taking the nearly unprecedented step of refusing to defend the law against a legal challenge from elected GOP officials in 20 states.\nThose state officials maintain that the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate is now unconstitutional because Congress repealed the tax penalties owed by those who fail to comply with it. And, further, they say the entire law must fall if the mandate doesn\u2019t conform to the Constitution. \nThe Trump administration merely wants the court to throw out the protections for people with pre-existing conditions. This, by the way, is separate from all the other stuff Trump is doing to damage the Affordable Care Act\u2019s insurance markets.\nBefore reviewing the absurd legal arguments of the U.S. Department of Justice under Attorney General Jeff Sessions, it\u2019s important to be clear about what would happen if these Republican officials succeed.\nAt a minimum, a ruling against the Affordable Care Act would eliminate the most popular part of the law President Barack Obama enacted in 2010: the ban on health insurance companies rejecting people or charging them higher premiums because of pre-existing conditions.\nIt might seem bizarre for the Trump administration to call for the end to a consumer protection that\u00a0the vast majority of Americans support\u00a0in the middle of an election year in which\u00a0Democrats\u00a0already are attacking the GOP\u00a0for harming the insurance markets and\u00a0driving up costs.\nBut the Justice Department lawyers thought of that. They asked the federal judge in Texas hearing the case to hold off on wrecking the insurance market until January \u2015 a couple of months after the midterm elections.\nA ruling in favor of the state officials or the Trump administration \u2015 each of which wants to court to blow up the Affordable Care Act in a different way \u2015 would herald the return of the days when people with any black marks on their medical histories could find themselves uninsurable.\nApplications for health coverage would once again require consumers to detail every time they\u2019ve been sick or injured, going back as far as 10 years, so that insurers could decide whether to issue a policy and how much to charge.\nIn other words, those with the greatest need for health care would again face the biggest obstacles to getting it.\nBut this wouldn\u2019t affect only people with histories of serious or chronic illnesses, such as cancer or diabetes. Women who have experienced postpartum depression or underwent Caesarean sections could be tagged as having pre-existing conditions. A high school sports injury or adolescent acne could even be enough for an insurance company to deny coverage or jack up rates.\nThis is how it worked before the Affordable Care Act for those who don\u2019t get health benefits from a large employer or a government program like Medicare.\nMore than 50 million Americans have something in their medical histories that could disqualify them from health insurance absent the Affordable Care Act\u2019s rules, according to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit research organization that focuses on national health issues.\nThese consequences would extend beyond those consumers who currently get their health insurance from the Affordable Care Act\u2019s exchange marketplaces or directly from insurers.\nPeople who have health benefits from a large employer wouldn\u2019t see their coverage disappear, but new employees could have to wait months for their coverage to start or shoulder the costs of any medical conditions they had before joining a company. Employees at small companies could face higher premiums because insurers could go back to setting rates based on the health status of the workers on these plans.\nThe original plaintiffs in the case are Maine Gov. Paul LePage (R), Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant (R) and the GOP attorneys general of 18 other states, led by Ken Paxton\u00a0of Texas. These officials, who brought the lawsuit in February, are seeking to have to entire Affordable Care Act stricken. \nThis would result in a 50 percent increase in the national uninsured rate,\u00a0boosting the number of people without coverage by 17.1 million, according to an analysis by the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.\nIf you live in Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia or Wisconsin, this is what your elected officials are doing.\nSessions\u2019 Justice Department doesn\u2019t go quite as far as these state officials, seeking only to have the court invalidate the protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Other parts of the Affordable Care Act, including its subsidies for private insurance and its expansion of Medicaid for poor adults, would remain if the court rules the way Justice wants. \nHow exactly the subsidies would still work under this scenario is unclear, since their value is calculated based on the cost of a standard insurance policy in each geographic area, and such a \u201cbenchmark\u201d plan can\u2019t exist if insurers can vary prices by each customer\u2019s health status.\nEven a ruling on these less-destructive grounds would still invalidate the pre-existing condition coverage portions of the Affordable Care Act. And health insurance markets\u00a0could become inhospitable again to anyone who has been to a doctor more than a couple of times in the last decade. \nTo understand how we got here and what the state GOP leaders and the U.S. Department of Justice are arguing, it\u2019s necessary to review what happened the first two times conservatives turned to the courts to undo the Affordable Care Act and what has happened since.\nIn 2012, the\u00a0Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Obama administration in a case challenging the law\u2019s individual mandate, which requires most U.S. residents to obtain health coverage or face fines for failing to comply. The question in that case was essentially whether the federal government can compel individuals to buy a commercial product and penalize them if they don\u2019t. At the time, Obama\u2019s Justice Department maintained the entire law couldn\u2019t stand without the mandate.\nChief Justice John Roberts and four other justices decided that this was constitutionally sound\u00a0because Congress has the authority to tax people, and the penalties qualified as such.\nThree years later, Roberts and five other justices sided with the Obama administration again in another attempt to damage the Affordable Care Act by eliminating insurance subsidies for more than half the country. \nThis case, engineered by conservative and libertarian lawyers, heavily relied on a fictitious history of Congress\u2019 intentions when lawmakers wrote the Affordable Care Act in 2009 and 2010. Seizing on a few words in the statute, these lawyers argued that Congress\u00a0wanted only residents of states that set up health insurance exchanges, not those in states that used the federal exchanges, to have access to subsidies. Roberts wasn\u2019t having it.\nAnd then last year, Trump and the GOP\u00a0Congress spent months trying to repeal major parts of the law \u2015 and uninsure 20 million or so people in the process \u2015 but failed. But they eventually were able to deal some damage to the law by repealing the financial penalties associated with the individual mandate, which, for practical purposes, eliminated the mandate.\nThen we come to the latest legal challenge, which appears to be as rigorously considered as a snotty Facebook comment.\nThe states\u2019 argument goes like this: The mandate was legal as a tax, but it\u2019s not a tax \u2015 or constitutional\u2015 now that there isn\u2019t a penalty (aha, take that, John Roberts!). But it goes further: Because the Obama administration argued in 2012 that the court couldn\u2019t invalidate the mandate without blowing up the whole law, the court should blow up the whole law now that there are no fines and there shouldn\u2019t be a mandate (aha, take that, Barack Obama!).\u00a0\nThe Justice Department\u2019s argument is similar to what the attorneys general assert but would only blow up the parts of the law for people with pre-existing conditions, not the rest of it (aha, take that, Barack Obama \u2015 but please not until after Election Day).\nTo be fair, using Roberts\u2019 argument about taxing and Obama\u2019s argument that the Affordable Care Act couldn\u2019t work without the mandate against them is clever, in a high school debate club kind of way.\u00a0\nThree career Justice Department attorneys took their names off the department\u2019s brief to the court last week. One of them, a veteran of more than 20 years, quit the day after it was issued. Chad Readler, the political appointee heading the Justice Department\u2019s civil division, signed off instead, and Trump announced his intention to nominate him to the federal appeals court the same day.\nSessions\u2019 decision to abandon the government\u2019s defense of a federal law is highly unusual. The Justice Department is responsible for representing the United States in lawsuits and is charged with defending lawful statutes as long as there is \u201cany reasonable argument\u201d\u00a0supporting the government\u2019s case. \nOne exception was the Justice Department\u2019s refusal under Obama to protect the Defense of Marriage Act in court seven years ago. That case was about human rights; the current one is about health insurance regulations.\u00a0\nStepping in for the federal government in this Affordable Care Act\u00a0are Democratic state leaders, led by California Attorney General Xavier Becerra,\u00a0who are defending the law instead. Officials from Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington state and the District of Columbia also are participating.\nIn different ways, the Republican state officials and Sessions\u2019 Justice Department argue that a ruling against the pre-existing condition provisions must also be a ruling against other parts of the law or the whole thing. \u00a0\nLeading legal scholars \u2015 including those who were central to bringing the previous lawsuits against the Affordable Care Act \u2015 think this lawsuit is nonsense.\n\u201cCongress told us what it wanted through its 2017 legislative actions. ... It repealed the penalty while leaving the insurance reforms in place,\u201d reads a brief to the court written by an ideologically diverse group of legal scholars.\u00a0\nThe American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans,\u00a0AARP\u00a0and a slew of other health care groups also think the lawsuit is very bad.\u00a0\nSo do Alaska Gov. Bill Walker (I),\u00a0Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper (D),\u00a0Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R),\u00a0Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf (D),\u00a0Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R),\u00a0Montana Gov. Steve Bullock (D),\u00a0Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval (R),\u00a0North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D) and Gov. Jay Inslee (D).\u00a0\n\u201cHelping our neighbors get health insurance even though they have a pre-existing condition is something Americans support and the administration\u2019s action will hurt families in our states,\u201d the governors wrote Monday in a joint statement.\u00a0\nSiding with the Republican state officials and the Trump administration are Gun Owners of America and a handful of conservative dark money and activist groups.\nAs for Congress as a whole, Republican lawmakers are more or less or stammering their way through justifications or misgivings.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) made some noises about how \u201ceverybody\u201d in the Senate supports protections for pre-existing conditions \u2015 a strange comment from a man who attempted to shepherd the weakening of those protections through the Senate last year.\u00a0\nThis court case could take months to resolve. If McConnell or any other GOP leaders in Congress wanted to, they could resolve the dispute with legislation, or at least file briefs of their own explaining their intentions when they repealed the mandate penalties. But they haven\u2019t, and there\u2019s no evidence they will. \nAfter all, they also want Obamacare obliterated \u2015 they just don\u2019t want their fingerprints on the detonator.
