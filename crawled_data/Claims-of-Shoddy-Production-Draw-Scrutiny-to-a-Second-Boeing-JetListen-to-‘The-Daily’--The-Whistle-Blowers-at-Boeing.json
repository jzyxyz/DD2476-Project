{"title": "Claims of Shoddy Production Draw Scrutiny to a Second Boeing JetListen to \u2018The Daily\u2019: The Whistle-Blowers at Boeing", "content": "NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. \u2014 When Boeing broke ground on its new factory near Charleston in 2009, the plant was trumpeted as a state-of-the-art manufacturing hub, building one of the most advanced aircraft in the world. But in the decade since, the factory, which makes the 787 Dreamliner, has been plagued by shoddy production and weak oversight that have threatened to compromise safety.\nA New York Times review of hundreds of pages of internal emails, corporate documents and federal records, as well as interviews with more than a dozen current and former employees, reveals a culture that often valued production speed over quality. Facing long manufacturing delays, Boeing pushed its work force to quickly turn out Dreamliners, at times ignoring issues raised by employees.\nComplaints about the frenzied pace echo broader concerns about the company in the wake of two deadly crashes involving another jet, the 737 Max. Boeing is now facing questions about whether the race to get the Max done, and catch up to its rival Airbus, led it to miss safety risks in the design, like an anti-stall system that played a role in both crashes.\n[Read more about how two high profile crashes led to a corporate crisis at Boeing.]\nSafety lapses at the North Charleston plant have drawn the scrutiny of airlines and regulators. Qatar Airways stopped accepting planes from the factory after manufacturing mishaps damaged jets and delayed deliveries. Workers have filed nearly a dozen whistle-blower claims and safety complaints with federal regulators, describing issues like defective manufacturing, debris left on planes and pressure to not report violations. Others have sued Boeing, saying they were retaliated against for flagging manufacturing mistakes.\nJoseph Clayton, a technician at the North Charleston plant, one of two facilities where the Dreamliner is built, said he routinely found debris dangerously close to wiring beneath cockpits.\n\u201cI\u2019ve told my wife that I never plan to fly on it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a safety issue.\u201d\nIn an industry where safety is paramount, the collective concerns involving two crucial Boeing planes \u2014 the company\u2019s workhorse, the 737 Max, and another crown jewel, the 787 Dreamliner \u2014 point to potentially systemic problems. Regulators and lawmakers are taking a deeper look at Boeing\u2019s priorities, and whether profits sometimes trumped safety. The leadership of Boeing, one of the country\u2019s largest exporters, now finds itself in the unfamiliar position of having to defend its practices and motivations.\n\u201cBoeing South Carolina teammates are producing the highest levels of quality in our history,\u201d Kevin McAllister, Boeing\u2019s head of commercial airplanes, said in a statement. \u201cI am proud of our teams\u2019 exceptional commitment to quality and stand behind the work they do each and every day.\u201d\nAll factories deal with manufacturing errors, and there is no evidence that the problems in South Carolina have led to any major safety incidents. The Dreamliner has never crashed, although the fleet was briefly grounded after a battery fire. Airlines, too, have confidence in the Dreamliner.\nBut workers sometimes made dangerous mistakes, according to the current and former Boeing employees, some of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity because they feared retaliation.\nFaulty parts have been installed in planes. Tools and metal shavings have routinely been left inside jets, often near electrical systems. Aircraft have taken test flights with debris in an engine and a tail, risking failure.\nOn several planes, John Barnett, a former quality manager who worked at Boeing for nearly three decades and retired in 2017, discovered clusters of metal slivers hanging over the wiring that commands the flight controls. If the sharp metal pieces \u2014 produced when fasteners were fitted into nuts \u2014 penetrate the wires, he said, it could be \u201ccatastrophic.\u201d\nMr. Barnett, who filed a whistle-blower complaint with regulators, said he had repeatedly urged his bosses to remove the shavings. But they refused and moved him to another part of the plant.\nA spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration, Lynn Lunsford, said the agency had inspected several planes certified by Boeing as free of such debris and found those same metal slivers. In certain circumstances, he said, the problem can lead to electrical shorts and cause fires.\nOfficials believe the shavings may have damaged an in-service airplane on one occasion in 2012, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.\nThe F.A.A. issued a directive in 2017 requiring that Dreamliners be cleared of shavings before they are delivered. Boeing said it was complying and was working with the supplier to improve the design of the nut. But it has determined that the issue does not present a flight safety issue.\n\u201cAs a quality manager at Boeing, you\u2019re the last line of defense before a defect makes it out to the flying public,\u201d Mr. Barnett said. \u201cAnd I haven\u2019t seen a plane out of Charleston yet that I\u2019d put my name on saying it\u2019s safe and airworthy.\u201d\nLess than a month after the crash of the second 737 Max jet, Boeing called North Charleston employees to an urgent meeting. The company had a problem: Customers were finding random objects in new planes.\nA senior manager implored workers to check more carefully, invoking the crashes. \u201cThe company is going through a very difficult time right now,\u201d he said, according to two employees who were present and spoke on the condition of anonymity.\nSo-called foreign object debris is a common issue in aviation. Employees are supposed to clean the bowels of the aircraft as they work, often with a vacuum, so they don\u2019t accidentally contaminate the planes with shavings, tools, parts or other items.\nBut debris has remained a persistent problem in South Carolina. In an email this month, Brad Zaback, the head of the 787 program, reminded the North Charleston staff that stray objects left inside planes \u201ccan potentially have serious safety consequences when left unchecked.\u201d\nThe issue has cost Boeing at other plants. In March, the Air Force halted deliveries of the KC-46 tanker, built in Everett, Wash., after finding a wrench, bolts and trash inside new planes.\n\u201cTo say it bluntly, this is unacceptable,\u201d Will Roper, an assistant secretary of the Air Force, told a congressional subcommittee in March. \u201cOur flight lines are spotless. Our depots are spotless, because debris translates into a safety issue.\u201d\nBoeing said it was working to address the issue with the Air Force, which resumed deliveries this month.\nAt the North Charleston plant, the current and former workers describe a losing battle with debris.\n\u201cI\u2019ve found tubes of sealant, nuts, stuff from the build process,\u201d said Rich Mester, a former technician who reviewed planes before delivery. Mr. Mester was fired, and a claim was filed on his behalf with the National Labor Relations Board over his termination. \u201cThey\u2019re supposed to have been inspected for this stuff, and it still makes it out to us.\u201d\nEmployees have found a ladder and a string of lights left inside the tails of planes, near the gears of the horizontal stabilizer. \u201cIt could have locked up the gears,\u201d Mr. Mester said.\nDan Ormson, who worked for American Airlines until retiring this year, regularly found debris while inspecting Dreamliners in North Charleston, according to three people with knowledge of the situation.\nMr. Ormson discovered loose objects touching electrical wiring and rags near the landing gear. He often collected bits and pieces in zip-lock bags to show one of the plant\u2019s top executives, Dave Carbon.\nThe debris can create hazardous situations. One of the people said Mr. Ormson had once found a piece of Bubble Wrap near the pedal the co-pilot uses to control the plane\u2019s direction, which could have jammed midflight.\nOn a Dreamliner that Boeing had already given a test flight, Mr. Ormson saw that a bolt was loose inside one of the engines. The small piece of metal could have caused the engine to malfunction.\nAmerican Airlines said it conducted rigorous inspections of new planes before putting them into service. \u201cWe have confidence in the 787s we have in our fleet,\u201d said Ross Feinstein, a spokesman for the airline.\nWhen it was unveiled in 2007, the 787 Dreamliner was Boeing\u2019s most important new plane in a generation. The wide-body jet, with a lightweight carbon fiber fuselage and advanced technology, was a hit with carriers craving fuel savings.\nAirlines ordered hundreds of the planes, which cost upward of $200 million each. Spurred by high demand, Boeing set up a new factory.\nNorth Charleston was ideal in many ways. South Carolina has the lowest percentage of union representation in the nation, giving Boeing a potentially less expensive work force.\nSouth Carolina doled out nearly $1 billion in tax incentives, including $33 million to train local workers. Boeing pledged to create 3,800 jobs.\nWhile Boeing has nurtured generations of aerospace professionals in the Seattle area, there was no comparable work force in South Carolina. Instead, managers had to recruit from technical colleges in Tulsa, Okla., and Atlanta.\nManagers were also urged to not hire unionized employees from the Boeing factory in Everett, where the Dreamliner is also made, according to two former employees.\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t want us bringing union employees out to a nonunion area,\u201d said David Kitson, a former quality manager, who oversaw a team responsible for ensuring that planes are safe to fly.\n\u201cWe struggled with that,\u201d said Mr. Kitson, who retired in 2015. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t the qualified labor pool locally.\u201d Another former manager, Michael Storey, confirmed his account.\nThe 787 was already running years behind schedule because of manufacturing hiccups and supplier delays. The labor shortages in North Charleston only made it worse.\nThe initial excitement when the first Dreamliners entered service in late 2011 was short lived. A little more than a year later, the entire fleet was grounded after a battery fire on a Japan Airlines plane.\nBoeing was forced to compensate carriers, hurting profit. All the while, the production delays mounted, and Airbus was close behind with a rival plane, the A350.\nIn North Charleston, the time crunch had consequences. Hundreds of tools began disappearing, according to complaints filed in 2014 with the F.A.A. by two former managers, Jennifer Jacobsen and David McClaughlin. Some were \u201cfound lying around the aircraft,\u201d Ms. Jacobsen said in her complaint.\nThe two managers also said they had been pushed to cover up delays. Managers told employees to install equipment out of order to make it \u201cappear to Boeing executives in Chicago, the aircraft purchasers and Boeing\u2019s shareholders that the work is being performed on schedule, where in fact the aircraft is far behind schedule,\u201d according to their complaints.\nThe F.A.A. investigated the complaints and didn\u2019t find violations on its visit to the plant in early 2014. But the agency said it had previously found \u201cimproper tool control\u201d and the \u201cpresence of foreign object debris.\u201d\nBoth managers left after they were accused of inaccurately approving the time sheets of employees who did not report to them. They both claim they were retaliated against for flagging violations. Through their lawyer, Rob Turkewitz, they declined to comment.\nGordon Johndroe, a spokesman for Boeing, said, \u201cWe prioritize safety and quality over speed, but all three can be accomplished while still producing one of the safest airplanes flying today.\u201d\nPlanes were also damaged during manufacturing. A Dreamliner built for American Airlines suffered a flood in the cabin so severe that seats, ceiling panels, carpeting and electronics had to be replaced in a weekslong process.\nWhile inspecting a plane being prepared for delivery, Mr. Clayton, the technician currently at the plant, recently found chewing gum holding together part of a door\u2019s trim. \u201cIt was not a safety issue, but it\u2019s not what you want to present to a customer,\u201d he said.\nAn employee filed a complaint about the gum with the F.A.A. The agency is investigating, an F.A.A. official said.\n[If you\u2019ve worked at Boeing and want to discuss your experience, reach us confidentially here.]\nThe disarray frustrated one major carrier. In 2014, factory employees were told to watch a video from the chief executive of Qatar Airways.\nHe chastised the North Charleston workers, saying he was upset that Boeing wasn\u2019t being transparent about the length or cause of delays. In several instances, workers had damaged the exterior of planes made for the airline, requiring Boeing to push back delivery to fix the jets.\nEver since, Qatar has bought only Dreamliners built in Everett.\nIn a statement, Qatar Airways said it \u201ccontinues to be a long-term supporter of Boeing and has full confidence in all its aircraft and manufacturing facilities.\u201d\nIn the interest of meeting deadlines, managers sometimes played down or ignored problems, according to current and former workers.\nMr. Barnett, the former quality manager, who goes by Swampy in a nod to his Louisiana roots, learned in 2016 that a senior manager had pulled a dented hydraulic tube from a scrap bin, he said. He said the tube, part of the central system controlling the plane\u2019s movement, was installed on a Dreamliner.\nMr. Barnett said the senior manager had told him, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d He filed a complaint with human resources, company documents show.\nHe also reported to management that defective parts had gone missing, raising the prospect that they had been installed in planes. His bosses, he said, told him to finish the paperwork on the missing parts without figuring out where they had gone.\nThe F.A.A. investigated and found that Boeing had lost some damaged parts. Boeing said that as a precautionary matter, it had sent notices to airlines about the issue. The company said it had also investigated the flawed hydraulic tube and hadn\u2019t substantiated Mr. Barnett\u2019s claims.\n\u201cSafety issues are immediately investigated, and changes are made wherever necessary,\u201d said the Boeing spokesman, Mr. Johndroe.\nBut several former employees said high-level managers pushed internal quality inspectors to stop recording defects.\nCynthia Kitchens, a former quality manager, said her superiors penalized her in performance reviews and berated her on the factory floor after she flagged wire bundles rife with metal shavings and defective metal parts that had been installed on planes.\n\u201cIt was intimidation,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery time I started finding stuff, I was harassed.\u201d\nMs. Kitchens left in 2016 and sued Boeing for age and sex discrimination. The case was dismissed.\nSome employees said they had been punished or fired when they voiced concerns.\nMr. Barnett was reprimanded in 2014 for documenting errors. In a performance review seen by The Times, a senior manager downgraded him for \u201cusing email to express process violations,\u201d instead of engaging \u201cF2F,\u201d or face to face.\nHe took that to mean he shouldn\u2019t put problems in writing. The manager said Mr. Barnett needed to get better at \u201cworking in the gray areas and help find a way while maintaining compliance.\u201d\nLiam Wallis, a former quality manager, said in a wrongful-termination lawsuit that Boeing had fired him after he discovered that planes were being manufactured using obsolete engineering specifications. Mr. Wallis also said in the suit, filed in March, that an employee who didn\u2019t exist had signed off on the repairs of an aircraft.\nHis boss had criticized him in the past for writing up violations, according to the lawsuit and emails reviewed by The Times. Boeing said it had fired Mr. Wallis for falsifying documents.\nThrough his lawyers, Mr. Wallis declined to comment for this article. Boeing has denied his claims and moved to dismiss the case.\nIn North Charleston, the pace of production has quickened. Starting this year, Boeing is producing 14 Dreamliners a month, split between North Charleston and Everett, up from the previous 12. At the same time, Boeing said it was eliminating about a hundred quality control positions in North Charleston.\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to shorten the time of manufacturing,\u201d said Mr. Mester, the former mechanic. \u201cBut are you willing to sacrifice the safety of our product to maximize profit?\u201d\n[The reporters on this article can be reached at Natalie.Kitroeff@nytimes.com and David.Gelles@nytimes.com.]", "date": "April 20, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/20/business/boeing-dreamliner-production-problems.html", "tags": "\u2018 charleston \u201c safety boeing daily claims second production scrutiny former jetlisten planes whistle-blowers employees shoddy draw"}
