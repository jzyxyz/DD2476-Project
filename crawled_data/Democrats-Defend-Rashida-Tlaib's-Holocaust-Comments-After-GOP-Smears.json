{"title": "Democrats Defend Rashida Tlaib's Holocaust Comments After GOP Smears", "content": "Democrats defended Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) as she faced a wave of backlash from Republicans attempting to twist a comment she made about the Holocaust.\nLast week Tlaib,\u00a0who became the first Palestinian-American woman in Congress in January, said during an interview she was \u201chumbled\u201d and got a \u201ccalming feeling\u201d when recalling that her \u201cancestors provided a [safe haven] in many ways\u201d for Jews during the Holocaust.\nHere\u2019s the full quote, made during an interview with Yahoo News\u2019 \u201cSkullduggery\u201d podcast\u00a0in commemoration of Holocaust Remembrance Day:\nRepublicans \u2015 including President Donald Trump \u2015 latched onto her use of \u201ca calming feeling\u201d in discussing the Holocaust, twisting the phrase for an opportunity to call the congresswoman anti-Semitic. The smear campaign smelled similar to the one Republicans lobbed at Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) \u2015 the fallout of which is ongoing.\nIn Tlaib\u2019s case, Dems were quick to condemn the bad faith operation. This week a number of Democrats came to her aid, including Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif), who tweeted, \u201cRepublicans\u2019 desperate attempts to smear @RepRashida & misrepresent her comments are outrageous. President @realDonaldTrump & House GOP should apologize to Rep. Tlaib & the American people for their gross misrepresentations.\u201d\nOmar fired directly at Trump, noting that he \u201cpraised people at a neo-Nazi rally.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThis is another transparent attempt to sow division between minority communities and distract from your own criminal behavior by smearing a Muslim woman,\u201d she stated on Twitter.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) called on Republicans to \u201cstop your ugly attacks against Muslim women in Congress.\u201d\u00a0\nTlaib pushed back herself, accusing Republicans of twisting her words for a \u201cracist and hateful agenda.\u201d\n\u00a0", "date": "\n05/14/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dems-defend-rashida-tlaibs-holocaust-comments-after-gop-smears_n_5cdabf26e4b0f7ba48ab24b2", "tags": "tlaib rashida democrats week holocaust defend gop republicans \u201d \u2015 comments smears made rep."}
