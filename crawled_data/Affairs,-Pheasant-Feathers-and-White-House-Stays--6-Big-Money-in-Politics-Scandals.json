{"title": "Affairs, Pheasant Feathers and White House Stays: 6 Big Money-in-Politics Scandals", "content": "Overnight stays in the White House for wealthy donors. A re-decoration of a congressional office with red walls and a plume of pheasant feathers. An elaborate strategy to hide an affair and a pregnancy.\nThe list of scandals related to money in politics got two new additions last month. In one, Michael D. Cohen, President Trump\u2019s former lawyer and fixer, pleaded guilty to breaking campaign finance laws.\nMr. Cohen said in court that Mr. Trump had directed him to arrange payments to two women \u2014 a pornographic film star and a former Playboy model \u2014 during the 2016 campaign to keep them from speaking publicly about affairs they said they had with Mr. Trump.\nIn the other, Representative Duncan Hunter, Republican of California, was accused of using $250,000 in campaign funds on personal expenses and lying to the Federal Election Commission.\nExperts say the majority of campaign finance law violations are clerical errors or missed deadlines, and are rectified by the parties involved. Many result in civil penalties \u2014 President Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign paid a $375,000 penalty to the F.E.C., largely for failing to notify regulators of contributions totaling $1,000 or more within 48 hours of receiving them.\nBut other cases are more extraordinary, like the vast fund-raising operation that enabled the Watergate break-in.\nIn fact, quite a few recent high-profile political scandals have had a campaign finance twist. Let\u2019s take a look.\n____\nHe became known as the \u201cLove Gov.\u201d\nIn April 2017, Gov. Robert Bentley, Republican of Alabama, stepped down under threat of impeachment and amid accusations that he was having an affair with his senior political adviser, Rebekah Caldwell Mason.\nA report by a special counsel to a state legislative committee had said that Mr. Bentley encouraged \u201can atmosphere of intimidation\u201d around his staff to keep them from speaking of his relationship with Ms. Mason, and that he had directed state employees to cover up the relationship. (Mr. Bentley had denied a physical relationship with Ms. Mason long before he resigned, despite recordings that suggested physical intimacy.)\nCentral to Mr. Bentley\u2019s resignation was a guilty plea to two misdemeanor charges: failing to file a major contribution report and knowingly converting campaign contributions to personal use.\nThe report describes how Mr. Bentley tried to use a member of his security detail to break up with Ms. Mason on his behalf, and how Mr. Bentley demanded that she be allowed to travel in official vehicles after she left the state\u2019s payroll.\nBefore the plea deal, the Alabama Ethics Commission had said it had probable cause to find that Mr. Bentley had committed felonies before he resigned, and had referred its findings to prosecutors.\n[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping the 2018 elections with our new politics newsletter.]\n____\nIn 2015, Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, was charged with bribery-related crimes based on his relationship with an eye doctor, Salomon E. Melgen.\nProsecutors said Dr. Melgen made more than $700,000 in direct and indirect political contributions to Mr. Menendez. Within days of one set of contributions, Mr. Menendez pressed federal officials to intervene in a Medicare billing dispute worth almost $9 million to Dr. Melgen. As evidence of illicit behavior, prosecutors also pointed to private flights for Mr. Menendez, as well as travel to a luxury hotel in Paris and seaside stays in the Dominican Republic.\nMr. Menendez maintained that he and Dr. Melgen were just close friends. The federal corruption trial for the two men ended in a mistrial in November.\nProsecutors initially said they intended to retry Mr. Menendez, but after a judge said some elements of their case were \u201cempty of relevant evidential fact,\u201d the Justice Department dropped the charges.\nIn a separate case, Dr. Melgen was convicted of Medicare fraud in April 2017.\nAs Mr. Menendez faces re-election in November, Republican efforts to defeat him have seized on the case.\n____\nWhen Aaron Schock joined the House in 2009, he was 27, and a rising Republican star from Illinois.\nHe pushed for more trade with Colombia, and attracted attention for his Instagram account with photos showing him surfing or glacier-jumping.\nBut in 2015, Mr. Schock resigned amid accusations that he had used taxpayer and campaign funds on private jets and concerts, and had failed to report extravagant gifts on financial disclosure forms.\nHe was also criticized for a series of office renovations that included blood-red walls, a crystal chandelier and a plume of pheasant feathers. The renovations were compared to the environs seen on the show \u201cDownton Abbey,\u201d and mocked by many. Mr. Schock had never \u201cseen \u2018Downton Abbey\u2019 and did not request an office designed like it,\u201d his lawyer said in 2016.\nMr. Schock eventually paid back the government tens of thousands of dollars for the renovations, according to The Associated Press.\nIn 2016, he was indicted on charges including wire fraud and theft of government funds. His trial date is scheduled for early 2019.\n____\nAn illicit affair, a pregnancy and a scheme to hide them during the 2008 presidential race.\nThat would become the focus of a trial in 2012 over whether John Edwards, a former Democratic presidential candidate, vice-presidential nominee and senator, broke campaign finance laws as part of the cover-up. A two-year investigation led to his indictment by a federal grand jury in 2011.\nMr. Edwards began the affair with a campaign videographer, Rielle Hunter, in 2006; she became pregnant the next year. Prosecutors said Mr. Edwards had used about $1 million to hide Ms. Hunter from his wife, Elizabeth Edwards, and the public. They also said he initially had an aide claim paternity of the child, who was born in 2008. Mr. Edwards admitted the child was his in 2010.\nMrs. Edwards died that December after battling cancer. One of her closest friends testified about the emotional turmoil Mrs. Edwards went through to believe that her husband had not conceived a child with Ms. Hunter.\nA jury could not reach a verdict on five charges of campaign finance fraud and conspiracy, and found Mr. Edwards not guilty on one other charge. Federal prosecutors later said they would not retry him.\n____\nThe Democratic Party\u2019s fund-raising tactics during the 1996 presidential campaign, including overnight stays for top donors in the White House\u2019s Lincoln Bedroom, became the subject of much controversy.\nIt would emerge that President Bill Clinton had personally approved a plan, years earlier, to reward Democratic donors and fund-raisers with meals, golf outings and jogs with him, as well as stays in the Lincoln Bedroom to \u201cenergize\u201d them for his re-election campaign. Critics referred to the selling of the Lincoln Bedroom.\nAfter Mr. Clinton\u2019s re-election, the administration released a list of 938 guests who stayed in the Lincoln Bedroom and other rooms, including some who did not donate.\nMr. Clinton largely defended the visits, saying that the guests had stayed as friends, not as contributors.\nThe scandal was soon overshadowed by revelations of Mr. Clinton\u2019s affair with a White House intern, Monica Lewinsky.\n____\nAnother scandal tied to that campaign would follow Vice President Al Gore for years.\nIn 2000, a longtime fund-raiser for Mr. Gore was convicted of five felony counts for helping arrange illegal donations to the Democratic Party and its candidates in 1996. About $55,000 of that was in connection with a visit by Mr. Gore to a Buddhist temple in the Los Angeles area during the campaign.\nProsecutors said that the fund-raiser, Maria Hsia, arranged for nuns and monks to write checks to make it seem that they were the donors to the Democratic National Committee. But they were actually reimbursed by the temple, a religious, tax-exempt institution barred from making political contributions.\nMr. Gore\u2019s credibility regarding what he knew came under scrutiny.\nThe scandal resurfaced during his failed 2000 presidential run. \u201cWho\u2019s he going to be today?\u201d one television ad asked. \u201cThe Al Gore who raises campaign money at a Buddhist temple? Or the one who promises campaign finance reform?\u201d", "date": "Sept. 9, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/09/us/politics/money-politics-corruption-scandal.html", "tags": "prosecutors scandals edwards \u201c money-in-politics bentley feathers menendez white house one affairs stays campaign pheasant big"}
