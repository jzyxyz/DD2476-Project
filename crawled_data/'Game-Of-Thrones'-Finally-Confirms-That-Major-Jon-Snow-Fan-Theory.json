{"title": "'Game Of Thrones' Finally Confirms That Major Jon Snow Fan Theory", "content": "(Warning! Spoilers are coming.)\nSnow doubt about it.\nFor years, fans have speculated that Jon Snow's true parentage isn't what it seems -- that is, he's the bastard son of Ned Stark and an unknown lowborn woman. In Sunday night's \"Game of Thrones\" Season 6 finale, we finally got the evidence we deserved.\n(Sorry, Ned. You are not the father.)\nThe most popular \"Game of Thrones\" theory claims that Jon Snow's real parents are Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark (hence the nickname, \"R + L = J\") -- and now,\u00a0it's been confirmed.\nOn Sunday, we finally got to see the rest of the Tower of Joy scene teased earlier in Season 6. In one of Bran's flashbacks, Ned makes it into the tower and finds his sister, Lyanna. As she lays dying post-childbirth, Lyanna tells Ned to protect her newborn baby.\nThen, a sharp cut to a fully grown Jon Snow.\u00a0\nWhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaattttttt!!!!!!\nLyanna Stark is Jon Snow's mommy.\nBut who's the daddy?\nWe don't actually have 100 percent confirmation that it's Rhaegar Targaryen, but, c'mon. Duh. He supposedly \"kidnapped\"\u00a0Lyanna and took her on the run. The Tower of Joy scene happens about a year after that. (According to science, that's long enough to have a baby.)\nHe's likely the dad. Thanks, science!\nALL HAIL THE KING IN THE NORTH!\u00a0\nCheck out our \"Game of Thrones\" Season 6, Episode 10 after show on below:\u00a0", "date": "\n06/26/2016", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/game-of-thrones-confirms-jon-snow-theory_n_576b0b93e4b065534f48e1a3", "tags": "game tower stark confirms season finally ned theory -- jon fan snow thrones lyanna major"}
