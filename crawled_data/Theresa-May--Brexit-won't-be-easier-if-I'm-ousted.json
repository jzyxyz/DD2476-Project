{"title": "Theresa May: Brexit won't be easier if I'm ousted", "content": "Theresa May has told her critics that getting rid of her as PM would not make delivering Brexit any easier.\nMrs May defended last week's draft agreement for leaving the EU and said there was a \"critical\" week ahead.\nShe suggested agreeing more details of UK's future relationship with the EU, ahead of an expected summit next week, could satisfy the concerns of some of the Tory MPs opposed to her plans.\nEx-Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said the UK was being \"bullied\" by the EU.\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party could get a better deal in time for Brexit, which is due to happen on 29 March.\nThere has been widespread criticism of the 585-page withdrawal agreement - published alongside a  shorter document setting out what the UK and EU's future relationship could look like - which is set be signed off at a summit next week.\nThere is also doubt over whether it can win the approval of the House of Commons.\nSome cabinet ministers have resigned, including Mr Raab, and others are believed to be trying to change its wording.\nIn other developments:\nMrs May told Sky News's Ridge on Sunday it had been a \"tough week\" but that she would not be distracted. She added the next seven days \"are going to be critical\" for the UK's future.\nAsked whether Sir Graham Brady - chairman of the backbench 1922 committee - had received the 48 letters needed to trigger a confidence vote in her leadership, she replied: \"As far as I know, no - it has not.\"\nAnd in a warning to those pushing for a change of leader, she said: \"It is not going to make the negotiations any easier and it won't change the parliamentary arithmetic.\"\nMrs May said negotiations were still taking place to put more detail into the future deal proposals, saying it was this part that \"delivers on the Brexit vote\".\nShe also said she would be meeting European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels ahead of the summit.\nBBC Europe editor Katya Adler\nThe European Commission says Mrs May will only meet Mr Juncker when concrete progress has been made on the content of the political declaration document on the future relationship.\nThose negotiations have been going on this weekend and had been expected to conclude on Tuesday - let's see.\nEU sources are clearly spelling out that the PM's visit would be to finalise this political declaration - and not to re-open the withdrawal deal approved last week by the cabinet.\nDespite the political turmoil in the UK, the EU intends the Brexit summit between EU leaders and the PM to go ahead next Sunday unless she is kicked out of her job, or she suddenly politically denounces the divorce deal she has been trying to sell.\nDon't forget - the withdrawal agreement will be legally binding. The political declaration on the future will not. It can be altered after Brexit, because it is only then that the detailed EU-UK negotiations on a future trade deal begin in earnest.\nEU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has been meeting diplomats from the 27 remaining EU member states.\nThe EU has now proposed 31 December 2022 as the ultimate end date for a possible extension to the transition period.\nThis period, during which the UK will have left but arrangements will largely continue as they are, is currently forecast to finish by the end of 2020.\nThe draft withdrawal agreement includes the option of extending it if more time is needed to reach a trade deal - but rather than specifying an end date, says a decision may be taken \"extending the transition period up to [31 December 20XX].\"\nAlso in the meeting there was a divide between states that want an ambitious trading relationship with the UK and those who want Britain's access to the single market to be more constrained, BBC Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming said.\nThe UK wants to maintain the status quo on internal security, which is also \"a problem,\" ambassadors were told. \nAnd Spain raised serious concerns about Gibraltar, which officials fear could grow in the coming days, he added.\nA diplomat said the message from the EU's Brexit negotiators to the member states was: \"Keep a lid on your concerns for now and we'll deal with them in the negotiations on the future relationship.\"\nSir Graham told BBC Radio 5 Live's Pienaar's Politics he would not reveal how many letters he had received - saying he had not even told his wife, who is his parliamentary assistant.\n\"I get asked in the supermarket, in the street,\" he said.\nSir Graham said he found the suggestion he had received 48 letters but not acted on it to be \"slightly offensive\".\n\"It's critical that people trust my integrity in this,\" he said.\nSir Graham also told the BBC's Sunday Politics North West it was \"very likely\" Mrs May would win a vote of no-confidence if there was one.\nIt is difficult to see how the 25 November EU summit could go ahead if Mrs May were to lose a confidence vote next week.\nIt is up to Sir Graham to decide when such a vote would be held, but he has said the process will move quickly. \nThe last time a Tory leader was ousted by their own MPs, in 2003, Iain Duncan Smith faced a confidence vote the next day.\nIf Mrs May were to lose that confidence vote it would spark a leadership election but she would not be allowed to run. She would remain prime minister until the contest was over unless she opted to resign and hand over to a caretaker prime minister.\nIn either circumstance, her version of Brexit would be in doubt.\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk has said the summit will go ahead unless something \"extraordinary\" happens - he did not elaborate on what that might be.\nMr Raab, who negotiated with the EU's Michel Barnier, explained his decision to quit on the BBC's Andrew Marr show.\nWith \"two or three points\" being changed he could support the government's proposals, he said.\nHe said he did not know who had inserted a clause on customs relations into the future partnership document but said it was a \"clear breach\" of the Conservative manifesto.\n\"The difficulty for me is that I was being asked to go over to Brussels and sign on the bottom line... on a deal which I said in good conscience I did not feel was right for the country,\" he said.\n\"I do think we are being bullied, I do think we are being subjected to what is pretty close to blackmail frankly.\n\"I do think there is a point at which, we probably should have done it before, where we just say 'I'm sorry this is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, we cannot accept those dictated terms'.\"\nThe draft document sets out the terms of the UK's departure, including details such as how much money will be paid to the EU, details of the transition period and citizens' rights.  \nBoth the UK and the EU want to avoid a hard Northern Ireland border so they agreed to include in the deal a \"backstop\" - or back-up plan - in case they cannot reach a long-term trade agreement which does this.\nThis would mean Northern Ireland would stay more closely aligned to some EU rules, which critics say is unacceptable.\nAnd the UK would not be able to leave the backstop without the EU's consent.\nWriting in the Sunday Telegraph, the Brexiteer MP Zac Goldsmith said under the PM's plan \"in effect, Britain would remain in the EU, but without having any say\".\nHe added: \"Had that been the choice, I personally would have voted to remain.\"\nLabour leader Mr Corbyn says his party, which has 257 MPs, will not support the deal.\nHe told Sky News the \"one-way agreement\" on Northern Ireland was \"not acceptable\", and there were no guarantees on workers' rights and environmental protections.\nIf it was voted down in the Commons, he said the government should go back to the EU and \"renegotiate, rapidly\".\nMr Corbyn insisted Labour would be able to negotiate a better deal, saying the proposed transition period - which will only happen if there is a withdrawal agreement - offered \"some opportunities\" for this.\nHe also said another referendum - as demanded by some of his MPs - was \"an option for the future but not an option for today\".\nHe said he voted Remain in the 2016 referendum but if there were to be another \"I don't know how I would vote - what the options would be at that time\".\nHe also revealed that he had not yet read all of the 585 page draft EU withdrawal agreement.", "date": "18 November 2018", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46250607", "tags": "brexit agreement may easier uk wo eu theresa future told ousted vote deal"}
