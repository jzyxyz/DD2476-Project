{"title": "German Far Right and Counterprotesters Clash in Chemnitz", "content": "BERLIN \u2014 Protesters flashing Nazi salutes and shouting \u201cForeigners out\u201d clashed Monday night with counterdemonstrators chanting, \u201cRefugees welcome,\u201d in a second night of violence in the east German city of Chemnitz that left several people injured and a country dismayed over images of rioting.\nThe police in Saxony said on Tuesday that several people had been treated for injuries sustained in the clashes Monday night. Ten people are being investigated for giving the Hitler salute, they said.\nThe violence first broke out on Sunday, after nationalists and far-right soccer fans called on supporters, including on social media, to take to the streets to \u201cdefend\u201d their country from immigrants after the killing of a 35-year-old German man.\nChancellor Angela Merkel expressed her condolences to the victim\u2019s family and condemned the violence, telling reporters in Berlin on Tuesday that she had seen videos of demonstrators \u201cgoing after people, riotous assemblies and hate in the streets.\u201d\n\u201cI can only stress that this has nothing to do with the rule of law in this country,\u201d Ms. Merkel said. \u201cThere can be no place in our streets for such rioting.\u201d She also welcomed the offer by her interior minister, Horst Seehofer, to support the authorities in Saxony in ensuring the rule of the law in Chemnitz.\nA 21-year-old Iraqi and a 22-year-old Syrian were arrested on Monday on suspicion of having stabbed the victim during an altercation with him and two other men, both of whom were injured, Christine M\u00fccke, a prosecutor in Chemnitz, said on Monday. The case was later taken over by a special prosecutor for handling extremism in the state of Saxony.\nChemnitz was celebrating its 875th anniversary over the weekend, but a street festival had to be shut down on Sunday. Police officers trying to ensure security at the festival were overwhelmed as hundreds of people joined the protests and counterprotests, and the police scrambled to call in reinforcements.\nInitially, only 50 to 80 officers were on duty Sunday, said Jana Ulbrich, a spokeswoman for the Chemnitz police. \u201cAfter the call-out on Facebook for a gathering, we tried to get more forces,\u201d she said.\nVideos from Sunday night showed a white man dressed in black chasing a darker skinned young man down the street as someone shouted, \u201cYou aren\u2019t welcome here!\u201d in the background.\nAfter a tense lull in the violence most of Monday, the confrontations resumed in force late in the day. Videos from Monday night showed several thousand demonstrators brandishing German flags and shouting, \u201cWe are the people\u201d and \u201cChemnitz is ours \u2014 foreigners out,\u201d and neo-Nazis gathered in the city, raising their right arms in the Nazi salute.\nOn the opposite side of a wide boulevard from the anti-immigrant forces, a smaller group shouted \u201cNazis out.\u201d In the middle of the thoroughfare, the police appeared outnumbered and overwhelmed, struggling to keep the groups apart. As the night wore on, bottles and fireworks flew, and demonstrators broke through police cordons.\n\u201cThe right to use force lies uniquely and solely with the state,\u201d Hans Strobl, general prosecutor for the state of Saxony, said on Monday. \u201cWe will take consequent action against all of those who do not accept this.\u201d\nSaxony has long struggled with far-right and nativist extremism. Part of the former East Germany, it borders the Czech Republic to the south and Poland to the east.\nIn 1991, shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall, a group of 500 neo-Nazis attacked buildings housing refugees in Hoyerswerda, northeast of Chemnitz. Since then, there have been far-right attacks against minority groups in Leipzig, and Freital, also in Saxony. The state capital, Dresden, is the birthplace of the anti-Muslim, nationalist movement Pegida, a German acronym for a title that translates roughly as Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West.\nThe state is also home to a strong faction of the Alternative for Germany party, known as AfD. Recent polls show the party firmly in place as the second-strongest force in the state, closing in on Ms. Merkel\u2019s conservatives.", "date": "Aug. 28, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/28/world/europe/chemnitz-protest-germany.html", "tags": "saxony counterprotesters clash german \u201d night state right police monday far chemnitz"}
