Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), whose comments about the Holocaust have been taken out of context by House GOP leaders in yet another example of\u00a0bad-faith attacks against Muslim lawmakers.\nTrump claimed in a tweet that Tlaib made a \u201chorrible and highly insensitive statement on the Holocaust,\u201d and he accused her of \u201ctremendous hatred of Israel and the Jewish people.\u201d\nIn an interview with Yahoo News published Saturday, Tlaib \u2015 one of the first Muslim women elected to Congress and the subject of Islamophobic attacks \u2015 explained her support for a one-state solution in the Israel-Palestine conflict. She said her Palestinian ancestors helped \u201ccreate a safe haven for Jews\u201d following the Holocaust.\nSeveral GOP House leaders seized on Tlaib using the phrase \u201ca kind of a calming feeling,\u201d and falsely said it describes how she feels about the Holocaust itself.", "date": "\n05/13/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-rashida-tlaib-holocaust-comments_n_5cd97d63e4b054da4e8d16a0", "tags": "rashida tlaib leaders piles holocaust gop \u201d trump house muslim donald comments attacks"}
