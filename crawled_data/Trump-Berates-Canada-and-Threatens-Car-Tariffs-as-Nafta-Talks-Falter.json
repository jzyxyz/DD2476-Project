{"title": "Trump Berates Canada and Threatens Car Tariffs as Nafta Talks Falter", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump said he rejected a meeting with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada during the United Nations General Assembly this week and threatened on Wednesday to punish Canada by taxing the cars it exports into America, signaling a new low in relations between the two nations.\nMr. Trump\u2019s comments come after months of tense trade negotiations between Canada and the United States have failed to produce an agreement and as the White House prepares to move ahead with a bilateral trade deal with just Mexico.\n\u201cFrankly, we\u2019re thinking about just taxing cars coming in from Canada,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a news conference on Wednesday. \u201cThat\u2019s the mother lode. That\u2019s the big one. We\u2019re very unhappy with the negotiations and the negotiating style of Canada.\u201d\nTrade tensions between the United States and Canada have been rising for months, and relations between Mr. Trump and Mr. Trudeau have soured amid disagreements over the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement.\nMr. Trump said he turned down a meeting with Mr. Trudeau because Canada had treated the United States \u201cvery badly\u201d and because of its high dairy tariffs, which are preventing the United States from selling milk into Canada. A spokesman for Mr. Trudeau said the prime minister never requested such a meeting.\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Trump appeared to snub Mr. Trudeau when he did not stand to shake the Canadian prime minister\u2019s hand during a lunch at the United Nations summit meeting. Mr. Trudeau said the two leaders did not meet because their schedules were full of meetings with leaders from far-flung countries.\nBut Mr. Trump did not offer a similar excuse, instead berating Canada over its negotiating style and its negotiator. \u201cWe don\u2019t like their representative very much,\u201d Mr. Trump said Wednesday, apparently referring to Chrystia Freeland, the Canadian foreign minister, who has been leading the Nafta talks for her country. Ms. Freeland has irked some in the administration by giving speeches suggesting that the United States, under Mr. Trump\u2019s leadership, is turning its back on democratic values and its traditional role as a global leader.\nMr. Trump left open the possibility of reaching a deal with Canada, but said there would be no more Nafta.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like Nafta. I\u2019ve never liked it. It\u2019s been very bad for the United States. It\u2019s been great for Canada, great for Mexico,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding that he would rename the pact \u201cU.S.M.C.\u201d for United States-Mexico-Canada.\nThe Trump administration is expected to send Congress text of a new Nafta on Friday that does not include Canada, according to congressional aides and others familiar with the discussions, raising doubts about the ability to keep the 25-year-old trilateral pact intact.\nOne month after the United States and Mexico reached a bilateral trade deal, talks between American and Canadian officials have yet to produce a similar agreement, with significant differences unresolved.\nRobert Lighthizer, Mr. Trump\u2019s top trade negotiator, said on Wednesday that \u201cat this point, we are running out of time\u201d for negotiations with the Canadians.\nThe impending failure to reach an agreement among the three countries by Sept. 30 is creating a new round of uncertainty for companies whose supply chains and businesses depend on access to all three markets and for lawmakers, who must determine whether they can allow the United States to go it alone with Mexico.\nMexico and the United States want to sign a final deal before the new Mexican government takes over on Dec. 1, and the final text of trade agreements must be released 60 days before they are signed by the president, under United States law, fueling the deadline.\nMr. Trump would not commit to pulling out of Nafta but said he was willing to go it alone with Mexico for now.\n\u201cWe\u2019re very well along the way with Mexico, the relationship\u2019s very good,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens with Canada. They\u2019re charging us 300 percent tariffs on dairy. We can\u2019t allow that to happen.\u201d\nCanada has said it will not allow the United States deadline to govern the trade talks. After marathon talks this month, Mr. Lighthizer and Ms. Freeland scheduled no formal meetings in Washington this week.\n\u201cWe will keep working as long as it takes to get to the right deal for Canada,\u201d Mr. Trudeau said at a news conference in New York on Wednesday.\nAsked what would happen if the United States moves forward with just Mexico, Mr. Trudeau said: \u201cWe will keep working on a broad range of alternatives. A broad range of paths are ahead of us.\u201d\nCanadian and American officials have tried to avoid negotiating in public, but in recent days their differences have started to spill out. Speaking at an event sponsored by Politico in Toronto on Wednesday, David MacNaughton, Canada\u2019s ambassador to the United States, said Canada wanted protection from the Trump administration\u2019s use of tariffs on national security grounds.\nUpcoming elections in Quebec, a province whose economy is heavily dependent on dairy, have also complicated negotiations for Canada\u2019s leaders as they look to close a deal with the United States.\n\u201cIt seems like Canada has decided it\u2019s too risky before the Oct. 1 Quebec elections to make any deal on Nafta, so the U.S. and Mexico deal will go forward and get signed, get stuck in the refrigerator,\u201d said Lori Wallach, the director of Global Trade Watch at Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group. \u201cCanada and the U.S. will talk and at some point they will all get stirred up and served together in Congress in 2019.\u201d\nCanada is the largest export market for America, and members of Congress from both parties have been adamant that it should be included in any agreement with Mexico. Congress must ratify major trade deals, and an agreement that excludes Canada is expected be difficult to pass. There is also an ongoing legal debate as to whether the president has the authority to terminate Nafta on his own. If Nafta is terminated, Canada and Mexico could continue to trade on its terms or work together on their own new free trade agreement.\nThe agreement the United States reached with Mexico in August updates Nafta provisions on the digital economy, automobiles, agriculture and labor unions. Among the most significant alterations are changes to rules governing car manufacturing, in an effort to bring more car production back to the United States from Mexico.\nThe core of the trade pact \u2014 which allows American companies to operate in Mexico and Canada without tariffs \u2014 remains intact.\nWith Nafta negotiations floundering, administration officials and Japanese leaders announced that they would open bilateral negotiations toward a free-trade agreement between the two nations.\nMr. Lighthizer said he would seek congressional approval to use so-called fast track authority to hasten the negotiations, which he said would proceed in two stages. First, he said, the countries will seek to reach an \u201cearly harvest\u201d agreement to reduce tariffs and other trade barriers for goods. Following that agreement, the countries said in a joint statement issued Wednesday afternoon, \u201cthe United States and Japan also intend to have negotiations on other trade and investment items.\u201d\nThe joint statement said the United States\u2019 goal in negotiations was to lift its auto industry. It also noted that Japanese officials would not exceed \u201cJapan\u2019s previous economic partnership agreements\u201d in opening up its markets for agricultural and forestry imports. That effectively means that the Trump administration concedes it will not win greater concessions in those areas from the Japanese than the Obama administration did in negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which Mr. Trump rejected after taking office.", "date": "Sept. 26, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/26/us/politics/trump-canada-nafta-tariffs.html", "tags": "falter nafta threatens united states \u201d trump talks tariffs mexico trade car canada said berates"}
