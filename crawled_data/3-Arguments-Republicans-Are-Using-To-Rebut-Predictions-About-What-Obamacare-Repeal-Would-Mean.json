{"title": "3 Arguments Republicans Are Using To Rebut Predictions About What Obamacare Repeal Would Mean", "content": "The secretary of Health and Human Services says nobody will be worse off financially.\nThe speaker of the House says coverage numbers are just numbers on a spreadsheet.\nAnd President Donald Trump\u2019s budget director thinks the agency that exists to evaluate large pieces of legislation shouldn\u2019t waste its time evaluating health care reform.\nThose were some of the arguments flying around on television Sunday, as administration officials and Republican congressional leaders were defending the House Republican bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\nThe timing is critical. This is the week that the Congressional Budget Office will issue its official projection of how the proposal would affect the federal budget and insurance coverage. Independent analysts have already predicted that it would cause millions of people to lose health insurance and pretty much everybody in Washington assumes the CBO will reach a similar conclusion \u2015 though nobody knows for sure.\nIf the Republican proposal were to cause significant insurance losses, it would run contrary to a\u00a0promise Trump made\u00a0over and over as a presidential candidate \u2015 that \u201ceverybody\u2019s got to be covered.\u201d More important, it would also mean millions of Americans would lose affordable access to care they need, sometimes to survive.\nOn Sunday, administration officials and Republican leaders laid out the three arguments they plan to use in response. None hold up well to scrutiny.\nRepublicans have been making this argument loudly for a few days now: The CBO got it wrong when it predicted the effects of the Affordable Care Act, so there is no reason to take it as gospel now.\nHere was Mick Mulvaney, budget director for the Trump administration, on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d:\nBut the CBO got the basic gist of what happened right, even if it was off in the magnitude. In May 2013, the CBO predicted that the number of people without insurance would drop by about 45 percent. Data from Gallup suggests that, according to its baseline, it came down by about 36 percent. And there\u2019s plenty of reason to think the number would be higher if, say, all states promoted enrollment with the enthusiasm states like California and Kentucky did.\nThe CBO\u2019s biggest error on enrollment was about the exchanges \u2015 that is, people buying through HealthCare.gov and state sites like Covered California. The CBO was way off there, as Mulvaney says. But partly that was because the CBO also expected more people would leave their employer plans, by choice or because their employers stopped offering them. Another factor, according to Edwin Park of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, could be that many people are staying in old, \u201cgrandmothered\u201d plans \u2015 which originally the law was not going to allow.\nNote, too, that with fewer people getting coverage through the exchanges, the federal government is also spending less. And it looks increasingly like CBO projected premiums just about right.\nNo forecast is perfect. But the CBO\u2019s are as good as anybody\u2019s, if not better. If the agency ends up saying the same thing as so many other forecasters \u2015 that the Republican plan would mean many millions lose insurance \u2015 then it\u2019s a safe bet the prediction is roughly correct.\n\u201cThey\u2019re scoring Obamacare as it exists today, not tomorrow,\u201d Mulvaney said. \u201cObamacare\u2019s this close from completely collapsing. For example, I live in South Carolina, we are down to one provider in that state. There\u2019s four or five states that I think are down to one provider. And the CBO is failing to take into consideration what happens to folks in South Carolina when there are no providers, which there may be as soon as next year.\u201d\nThe newly reformed markets in some states are struggling right now. That is a fact. Insurers generally haven\u2019t attracted young and healthy people in the numbers that they had hoped, so many are losing money \u2015 and, in response, some are pulling out of markets altogether. The situation is worst in a handful of states, like Arizona and North Carolina, where large swaths of the population have only one carrier right now. As of today, some counties in Tennessee have none lined up for next year.\nShoring up those markets is both an important and not-that-difficult task for an administration and Congress interested in doing so. Some combination of regulatory tweaks and a little extra money would probably suffice. The House bill even has one such provision, a program to offer carriers \u201creinsurance,\u201d tucked in amid all the other radical changes.\nAt the same time, plenty of states have successful, stable markets where consumers can still choose from a variety of plan choices, with prices comparable to or better than employer policies \u2015 and that\u2019s before accounting for the law\u2019s tax credits.There are also signs that even the weaker markets are improving, now that insurers have raised prices to be more in line with their costs.\nThe forecasters don\u2019t expect coverage losses simply because people getting subsidized plans will lose their insurance. They also expect a huge decline in Medicaid enrollment, because the Republican plan would roll back the Affordable Care Act\u2019s expansion and then \u2015 on top of that \u2015 create a new funding system for the program that\u2019s likely to cut its spending over time.\nMulvaney said it doesn\u2019t matter whether people have \u201ca little plastic piece of paper that says they have an insurance policy.\u201d On CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said he\u2019s not going to worry about whether the Republican plan produces a \u201cnice-looking spreadsheet\u201d of coverage statistics. The issue, they and other Republicans say, is whether people have better access to care.\nNobody would dispute that last part. The ultimate goal of health care policy is to make sure people can go to a doctor, fill a prescription or get other forms of medical care when they need it \u2015 and without experiencing severe financial distress. Similarly, a lot of people who have bought private coverage through the exchanges have policies they consider unaffordable, or even unusable, because the out-of-pocket expenses are so high. This is a failure of the law that even its supporters have said they want to remedy.\nBut for millions, out-of-pocket costs have come down, because their new insurance has smaller co-pays and deductibles, because it covers more services or because they had no coverage previously. (If you are uninsured, all\u00a0medical care is an out-of-pocket expense.) Overall, access to care has improved while financial distress from medical bills has declined, according to research published in places such as the Journal of the American Medical Association.\nIf the Republican plan becomes law, the cumulative effect of its changes both to regulations and financial assistance will be that exposure to medical bills gets bigger, not smaller. On the whole, premiums might end up coming down, if the entire GOP agenda comes to pass, but then out-of-pocket costs would soar. Costs for the average enrollee would go up by $1,542 in 2018 and by $2,409 in 2020, according to calculations that Harvard economist David Cutler and a group of colleagues published in Vox last week.\nThat figure doesn\u2019t even take into account all the people who would lose Medicaid coverage and end up uninsured. Republicans like to say the program doesn\u2019t do any good, but it improves access and reduces financial distress, according to a huge amount of scholarship.\nAverages always mask variation and some people, including some middle-income people, will be better off if the Republican plan becomes law. But overall the trend will be to shift federal assistance away from people who need it most in order to afford care. Without that assistance, getting care will become more difficult, not less.\n\u201cI firmly believe that nobody will be worse off financially in the process that we\u2019re going through, understanding that they\u2019ll have choices that they can select the kind of coverage that they want for themselves and for their family, not the government forces them to buy,\u201d Tom Price, HHS secretary, said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a slightly different version of a promise he made earlier this week, that nobody would lose coverage at all. And not much easier to justify.", "date": "\n03/12/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/republicans-budget-obamacare-repeal_n_58c57942e4b0ed71826d3c8d", "tags": "arguments people care coverage obamacare predictions repeal using would \u201d \u2015 cbo republican insurance republicans mean rebut"}
