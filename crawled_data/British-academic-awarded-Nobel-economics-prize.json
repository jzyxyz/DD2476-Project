By linking detailed individual choices and aggregate outcomes, his research has helped transform the fields of microeconomics, macroeconomics, and development economics.\"\nThe work for which Professor Deaton has been honoured revolved around three questions:\n\"His research has uncovered important pitfalls when comparing the extent of poverty across time and place,\" the committee said.\nThe Edinburgh-born academic, who had been in the running for the prize several times in past years, was previously at Cambridge and Bristol universities.\nThe award includes prize money of 8m Swedish kronor (\u00a3637,000, $950,000).\nThe economics award was not created by Alfred Nobel in 1895, but was added by Sweden's central bank in 1968 as a memorial to the Swedish industrialist.\nThe Nobel prizes will be given to winners on 10 December at ceremonies in Stockholm and Oslo.", "date": "12 October 2015", "href": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-34505586", "tags": "academic prize poverty economics nobel awarded british research swedish deaton professor"}
