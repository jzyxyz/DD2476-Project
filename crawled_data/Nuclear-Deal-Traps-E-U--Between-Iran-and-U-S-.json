{"title": "Nuclear Deal Traps E.U. Between Iran and U.S.", "content": "BRUSSELS \u2014 As the divide widens between the United States and Iran over the 2015 nuclear deal, the European Union finds itself trapped between them, with no easy or quick way to respond to its dilemma.\nPresident Trump pulled out of the deal, which the European Union championed and which three key European allies of the United States \u2014 Britain, Germany and France \u2014 all continue to support. The United States has reinstated punishing sanctions intended to disrupt Iranian oil exports and trade.\nThe Europeans have been trying, without much success, to come up with a way to compensate for the American sanctions and protect trade with Iran, mollifying Tehran and salvaging the agreement\u2019s limits on the Iranian nuclear program.\nBut on Wednesday, President Hassan Rouhani said Iran would scale back some of its commitments to the deal. In a carefully calibrated speech, he said Iran would retain its enriched uranium and heavy water rather than selling them to other nations while remaining, for now, within the limits prescribed in the nuclear deal.\nBut Mr. Rouhani warned that Iran could resume high-level uranium enrichment if the remaining signatories \u2014 Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia \u2014 did not make good, in the next 60 days, on promises to shield its oil and banking sectors from American penalties. He also hinted that Iran could do less to block migrants and drugs from entering Europe.\nThere was little immediate response from European leaders to Mr. Rouhani\u2019s statement on Wednesday. But they have sharply criticized American actions, which many consider aimed at overthrowing the Iranian government, despite denials from Washington.\n[In Washington, a White House official said new sanctions against Iran would be announced \u201cvery soon.\u201d Read our coverage here.]\nThe split between the United States and its traditional allies was evident on Wednesday, when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared at a news conference in London with his British counterpart, Jeremy Hunt.\nMr. Pompeo stressed the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between the United States and Britain, dismissing any suggestion of serious tensions as a \u201cparlor game,\u201d insisting that both countries were on the same side and saying that the United States would wait to see what Iran actually does.\nBut those remarks were belied by earlier comments from Mr. Hunt, the British foreign secretary, who described the developments in Iran as \u201cunwelcome\u201d and warned there would be consequences for Tehran if it failed to comply with the agreement.\nAlthough both countries wanted to make sure that Iran would not develop a track to build a nuclear weapon, Mr. Hunt added, \u201cIt\u2019s no secret we have a different approach on how best to achieve that.\u201d\nThe Europeans have been working on a limited way around American sanctions that would allow European companies to do a kind of barter trade with Iran without using the dollar or ordinary banks. Set up by Germany, Britain and France, the mechanism, called Instex, or \u201cInstrument in Support of Trade Exchanges,\u201d is in its initial stages, and relied on Iran setting up a similar system, which happened only at the end of April.\nBut so far even Instex has only been seen as a way to trade in items not covered by American sanctions, including medical goods, food and humanitarian aid, and Mr. Pompeo indicated that nothing had changed on that front.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve talked with the U.K., Germany and France,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said at the news conference. \u201cThere are provisions that allow humanitarian aid and certain products to get in the country. But when transactions go beyond that, there will be consequences.\u201d\nThere is no indication that European companies, which do far more trade with the United States than with Iran, will want to use Instex and risk being punished somehow by Washington.\n\u201cInstex was never thought of as economically efficient,\u201d said Pierre Vimont, the former executive secretary-general of the European External Action Service, the European Union\u2019s foreign affairs and defense agency. \u201cIt was always considered a political answer to underline to Iran that we, like Russia and China, are still committed to the nuclear deal.\u201d\nAt the same time, the Europeans have been trying to negotiate with both Washington and Tehran on how to restrain Iran\u2019s non-nuclear and anti-Israel activities, like its ballistic missile program and support for terrorism and for regional actors like the Syrian government, Hezbollah and Hamas. It is the nuclear deal\u2019s failure to have covered these other activities that Mr. Trump has said made it \u201cthe worst\u201d in history.\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo suddenly postponed meetings with top German leaders on Tuesday to fly to Iraq to respond to what he said were increased but unspecified dangers to Americans there from Iran\u2019s forces and allies. But some Europeans wondered why he could not have seen the German chancellor and foreign minister, Angela Merkel and Heiko Maas, before rushing to Baghdad for a few hours before traveling to London.\nColin Kahl, writing in Foreign Policy, suggested that the Trump Administration is seeking military confrontation with Iran and even heading toward war. Mr. Kahl, who was national security adviser to former Vice President Joe Biden, highlighted a statement from John Bolton, Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, that Washington would deploy a carrier strike group along with a bomber task force to the Persian Gulf, \u201cto send a clear and unmistakable message to the Iranian regime that any attack on United States interests or on those of our allies will be met with unrelenting force.\u201d\nThe United States, Mr. Bolton continued, \u201cis not seeking war with the Iranian regime\u201d but is \u201cfully prepared to respond to any attack.\u201d Mr. Kahl called that a provocation to Iran.\nRussia, less dependent on the American banking system and under its own set of sanctions from Washington, has promised to keep trading with Iran, as has China, which has been Iran\u2019s main buyer of oil. But it is not clear how significant that trade is or how far China will want to test Washington while engaged in sensitive trade talks.\nNor is it clear how Europeans will be able to protect the Iranian banking system or its oil trade, especially now that Washington, as of May 1, has canceled waivers that permitted some countries to buy Iranian oil.\nThat move was sharply criticized by the European Union and the foreign ministers of Britain, France and Germany in a statement on Saturday, which also noted that Iran continued to abide by the terms of the nuclear deal.\nThe German government on Wednesday called on Iran to uphold its commitment to the agreement and pledged to do the same.\n\u201cGermany expects complete implementation of the agreement from Iran,\u201d Steffen Seibert, spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel, told reporters in Berlin. \u201cAs Europeans and Germans, we will also do our part.\u201d\nIn Paris, France\u2019s defense minister, Florence Parly, said on Wednesday that France wanted to keep the nuclear deal alive but warned Iran that it could face more sanctions if it did not honor its part of the deal. \u201cToday nothing would be worse than Iran, itself, leaving this agreement,\u201d she told BFM TV.\nThe Latvian foreign minister, Edgars Rinkevics, said on Twitter that Iran\u2019s decision \u201cwill negatively impact global and regional security,\u201d and that as a signatory to the deal, the \u201cEuropean Union must discuss this development and respond adequately.\u201d\nThough not on the official agenda, Iran is likely to be discussed at a European Union summit meeting tomorrow in Sibiu, Romania, a session devoted to the union\u2019s future.\nA spokeswoman for Federica Mogherini, the bloc\u2019s foreign policy chief, said her office was \u201cfully committed\u201d to the deal with Iran, calling it a \u201ckey achievement of the global nuclear nonproliferation architecture, which is in the security interest of all.\u201d\nBut the Europeans are divided, with some countries unwilling to confront President Trump on an issue \u201cthat is such a priority for the U.S. administration,\u201d Mr. Vimont said.\nIt\u2019s not clear that Europe can respond sufficiently in any case. \u201cWhat kind of initiative is there to get out of this?\u201d Mr. Vimont asked. \u201cI don\u2019t see one.\u201d", "date": "May 8, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/world/europe/eu-iran-nuclear-sanctions.html", "tags": "iran european nuclear united states \u201d u.s e.u traps deal"}
