{"title": "French Businesses Hope Macron\u2019s Victory Will Ignite an Economic Revival", "content": "TROYES, France \u2014 As the results of France\u2019s presidential election rolled in on Sunday, Fran\u00e7oise Horiot watched with relief, optimistic about the prospects for her small aviation business.\nThe victory of Emmanuel Macron, an economic centrist, gave her hope that the mechanics in her factory could be more productive if he followed through on promises to ease regulations. And it erased fears that her ties with suppliers and clients in Europe, Turkey and China might founder if his opponent, Marine Le Pen, could have made good on promises to pull France out of the European Union.\n\u201cMacron has so much to do, both at the national and European level,\u201d said Mrs. Horiot, 69, who runs Entreprise Troyes Aviation, which employs 15 people in this industrial and agricultural region in central France. \u201cI hope he\u2019ll have the power to improve the economy.\u201d\nHe may not.\nDuring the campaign, Mr. Macron promised to swiftly pass measures to lower France\u2019s high unemployment rate and revive growth, which has remained stagnant in the wake of Europe\u2019s financial crisis. A priority for the more than three million small and medium businesses that form the backbone of the economy is a revision of the nation\u2019s 3,300-page labor code, which they say makes it difficult to lay off employees and discourages them from hiring new workers.\nBut Mr. Macron, like many of his predecessors, will face political and social hurdles to change.\nHis new party, La R\u00e9publique en Marche \u2014 Republic on the Move \u2014 must secure a parliamentary majority in legislative elections next month, or face years of possible political gridlock. French trade unions have also vowed nationwide protests to stop him from pushing France toward a less protected labor market, which they warn would fuel precariousness and nourish the populism that lifted Ms. Le Pen.\nAt least half of the battle may be simply persuading the French people \u2014 and French businesses, investors and workers \u2014 to feel more optimistic about the future after a long malaise.\n\u201cThe best case is it takes some time, but he manages to implement at least half of what\u2019s needed to stop decreasing competitiveness and change the trajectory of France,\u201d said Olivier Marchal, the chairman of Bain & Co. France, a business consultancy.\n\u201cIf he accomplishes that, then employment picks up, confidence is rebuilt, new investment comes in, and we shift from a vicious cycle to a virtuous one,\u201d Mr. Marchal added. If not, \u201cthen the economic situation is going to be a major issue, both for France and for Europe.\u201d\nThe Aube region of central France, of which Troyes is the de facto capital, has grappled with economic uncertainty for years. Unemployment has lingered around 13 percent, higher than the national average, as jobs were lost over the decades.\nLayoffs recently swept through a nearby Michelin tire factory. Textile manufacturers once implanted in the region closed amid cheap global competition.\nThe breakdown of the votes belied the economic weakness. Mr. Macron won 54 percent of votes in the region in Sunday\u2019s election. But Ms. Le Pen, who campaigned hard among disaffected workers, had 46 percent of the vote, more than 11 points above the national average.\nMr. Macron\u2019s platform plays well to businesses around Troyes, a town of 60,000 lined with 16th-century timbered houses and a phalanx of cafes and small shops. A handful of factories that have weathered global competition and the downturn dot the lush landscape on Troyes\u2019s outskirts.\nMr. Macron says he wants to lower the taxes employers pay to fund France\u2019s social welfare system, and to cut employee taxes to increase take-home pay. He proposes investing more than 15 million euros in retraining laid-off workers, and allowing company-level agreements on issues that are now decided by industrywide labor negotiations, such as working hours. And he vows to reduce the administrative burden on small businesses, which must negotiate a thicket of regulations.\n\u201cHe acted like a businessman in his campaign,\u201d said Didier Duchene, the president of the Medef employers association for Aube and founder of CMD2, a metalworking company on the outskirts of Troyes that specializes in making ornate iron grills and industrial doors. \u201cHe understands business, and he\u2019s got a strategic plan.\u201d\nMr. Duchene employs about 30 workers on full-time contracts in his iron workshop \u2014 many of them longtime employees with artisanal experience. When a big order comes in, he may need to hire 20 more, but only until the job is done. Because it is costly and complex to downsize, he must negotiate an expensive exit for employees, or consider taking additional people on short-term contracts.\n\u201cI\u2019m always having to calculate: If I hire more people for a job, how much would it cost to downsize?\u201d he said.\nFor workers who think they might be caught at the wrong end of Mr. Macron\u2019s policies, a sense of wariness lingers.\nAntoine Dion, 23, said he had little hope that Mr. Macron would improve conditions for people like him who have had trouble finding a steady job. He moved to Troyes two months ago from Paris, where he could not find regular work, and was looking for jobs as a plumber, a salesman or anything that would bring a secure paycheck.\n\u201cMacron is going to set up harmful policies for employment, and he wants to move jobs offshore, to cheaper countries,\u201d Mr. Dion said. \u201cWith Macron, everybody will be able to hire and fire easily \u2014 those are the ultraliberal values we are forced to adopt.\u201d\nUnemployment has been stuck around 10 percent for more than four years as the economy failed to rebound from the European financial crisis as quickly as Germany and other countries. Around a quarter of young people are jobless, and the vast majority of new contracts are temporary or precarious, fueling an acute sense of inequality.\nYet at the unemployment office in Troyes, scores of other job seekers who have long been looking for work expressed hope.\n\u201cMacron talks about economic reforms and investing more in job training,\u201d said Damien Coffinet, 28, who was fired from his job as an insurance salesman two months ago and came to see if he could receive retraining to become a plumber or electrician. \u201cThe changes won\u2019t come easy, but I see a rosier future.\u201d\nThe problems are entrenched. Companies say they grapple with high costs, whether from taxes used to fund the social safety net or from navigating complex regulations.\nDenis Arnoult, the president of France Teinture, a fabric dye maker that employs 100 workers in Troyes on a seven-acre site, said the labor code created administrative burdens, time better spent dealing with clients.\nWhile business slumped after the European financial crisis, it has picked up since a French fashion label, Le Coq Sportif, started placing orders. But Mr. Arnoult faces hurdles hiring new workers, partly because of social taxes that are among the highest in Europe.\nIn addition, state-run job placement programs do not provide adequate retraining to adapt potential employees to his needs. Even as he has tried to cut costs, he has had to fund in-house training.\n\u201cThe costs on business are just too high,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to have more economic dynamism, these need to come down.\u201d\nSome of the pressures come from outside France, complicating Mr. Macron\u2019s economic puzzle.\nMrs. Horiot\u2019s business relies on orders from around the European Union, so she grapples with extra layers of European bureaucracy and regulations imposed by Brussels.\nToo many European Union rules also make it hard for her mechanics to do their job, she says. When they repair the hood of a small plane, it adds an hour just to check off all of the safety requirements.\n\u201cWe have to go through the same process as a giant like Airbus, but we\u2019re a small company,\u201d she said. \u201cThe labor code and E.U. regulations are not adapted for small companies.\u201d\nHer worry was that Mr. Macron might be blocked from delivering on many promises, especially if he faces opposition in Parliament or if unions call for protests.\nIf he cannot follow through, the risks may be bigger than continued economic stagnation, Mr. Arnoult of France Teinture said.\n\u201cWe are at a turning point,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Macron doesn\u2019t succeed, we\u2019ll have more populism when the next presidential election comes around.\u201d", "date": "May 9, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/09/business/french-election-economy-macron.html", "tags": "job hope victory france troyes macron revival \u201d economic workers said french ignite businesses"}
