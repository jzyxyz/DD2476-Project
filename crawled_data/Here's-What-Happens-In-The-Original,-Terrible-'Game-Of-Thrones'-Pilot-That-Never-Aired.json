{"title": "Here's What Happens In The Original, Terrible 'Game Of Thrones' Pilot That Never Aired", "content": "\u201cOne of the most painful experiences of my life.\u201d\nThat\u2019s how David Benioff\u00a0once described seeing friends test-screen his and co-showrunner Dan Weiss\u2019 original \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d pilot\u00a0in 2010. After that viewing, more than 90 percent of the episode was supposedly reshot before it aired on HBO in April 2011, eventually leading to the phenomenon that the series is today.\nBut that first terrible, horrible, no good, very bad pilot \u2015 called a \u201cpiece of shit\u201d by the showrunners\u2019 screenwriter friend Craig Mazin \u2015 never saw the light of day. It became legend, something that could live only in Old Nan\u2019s stories. Or so we thought.\nIt\u2019s an oft-forgotten fact that George R.R. Martin, whose A Song of Ice and Fire novels serve as inspiration for \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d has been depositing old copies of his writing to Texas A&M\u2019s Cushing Memorial Library in College Station for more than two decades. He is said to have fallen in love with Cushing\u2019s sci-fi collection and its archival system during visits to AggieCon as far back as the 1970s and decided to make the quiet spot in Texas a home for his massive catalog of original manuscripts.\nThe resulting collection at the library takes up multiple walls, the first of which is properly called the Wall. It\u2019s a collection so vast, it\u2019d make Samwell Tarly\u2019s head spin, staffed by a team of dedicated librarians and professors who serve as a kind of Night\u2019s Watch. Among the archive\u2019s many files are manuscripts for the\u00a0A Song of Ice and Fire novels, and \u2015 as I learned during a trip to Texas over the summer \u2015 a box containing a production draft of that painful \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d pilot.\u00a0\nAn early\u00a0version of the pilot script\u00a0supposedly surfaced online years ago, but the script\u2019s authenticity was never officially verified. No one seemed to know how similar it was to the rejected pilot that HBO shot or how much it differed; scripts often go through various rewrites, so the mysterious version floating around online could have been from any phase of revisions.\u00a0\nI had three days to spend in Texas, but it took only five minutes to realize the script online and the one at Cushing are different.\u00a0There are reasons to believe that the version in Texas is similar to the pilot script that HBO shot: The production draft at Cushing is dated Oct. 22, 2009, right around the time the unaired pilot\u00a0started filming. The Cushing script credits the unaired pilot\u2019s original director, Tom McCarthy, who was later replaced in reshoots by Tim Van Patten. Plus, in terms of content, the Cushing script contains storylines that have been rumored to be in the unaired pilot script (as we\u2019ll get into below) \u2015 key story departures, dialogue alterations and location changes that cast the Seven Kingdoms in a different light.\n\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d isn\u2019t returning until\u00a0April 2019, but fans are already bracing for a\u00a0final season full of callbacks to early moments in the show, which will complete its eight-year \u201cmassive jigsaw puzzle,\u201d as it was described by Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who plays Jaime Lannister.\nIn advance of the season premiere, we exhaustively rummage through the secrets hidden in the pilot script from Martin\u2019s collection, involving everything from an unreleased Cersei Lannister moment to a really drunk Jon Snow making a scene. Here\u2019s what Westeros might have looked like if that \u201cpiece of shit\u201d pilot had aired:\n\u00a0\nLet\u2019s begin with a defining scene between King Robert Baratheon and Ned Stark in the Winterfell crypts.\u00a0\nThe scene that aired on HBO is slightly different from the scene in the Cushing script, but the gist is the same. Robert asks Ned to be his new Hand of the King, a position left open after Jon Arryn\u2019s death. That\u2019s when Robert places something small but highly symbolic on a statue of his onetime betrothed, Lyanna Stark: a feather.\u00a0\nAnd that pretty much sums up the sequence you saw in Season 1:\nBut in the script found in the Cushing library, Queen Cersei plays a pivotal role in this exchange\u2019s aftermath \u2015 so much so that her involvement would have changed a Season 5 episode, the recent Season 8 teaser and possibly more.\u00a0\nThe following scene is written into the pilot script found at Cushing and involves Cersei visiting the crypts right before the feast at Winterfell:\nCersei exits the crypts, crosses the courtyard and walks into the antechamber between the kitchen and the Winterfell great hall. The celebration for the king\u2019s arrival is underway, and servants are rushing past her with food.\u00a0The queen\u2019s handmaidens make adjustments to her outfit and remove her heavy fur.\nThen Cersei reveals something she has inside her sleeve:\nWhy does it matter?\nThe episode that aired on HBO gave no indication that Cersei was aware of the feather Robert placed on Lyanna\u2019s statue, let alone that she removed it to be burned.\nWithout this intervention, the feather goes on to play an important role in HBO\u2019s recent\u00a0Season 8 \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d teaser, falling to the ground as Jon Snow walks by and freezing when a wave of cold air rolls over it.\nEven before that, the feather was featured in Season 5, Episode 4, \u201cSons of the Harpy,\u201d when Sansa Stark visits the Winterfell crypts and comes across the token Robert placed on the statue years ago.\nThe series\u2019 creators, Benioff and Weiss, acknowledged the feather\u2019s station in the crypts to\u00a0Making of Game of Thrones, explaining that, after all this time, the feather would surely still be there because there \u201chasn\u2019t been a janitorial crew going down and vacuuming.\u201d\n\u201cWe thought it would be kind of a great thing,\u201d they added, \u201cto have Sansa wondering about it.\u201d\u00a0\nWhy Sansa? And why a feather?\nIf you\u2019ve been living under a Casterly Rock your entire life, you might\u2019ve missed the curious role that birds play in \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d There\u2019s Varys\u2019 spy network of \u201clittle birds,\u201d there\u2019s the High Sparrow, there\u2019s the Three-Eyed Raven, and then there\u2019s Sansa, who is often referred to as a \u201clittle bird\u201d or \u201clittle dove.\u201d\u00a0These characters have a few things in common: They\u2019re misunderstood, underestimated and often hold powerful information.\nThe feather could hint at how Lyanna, too, was a misunderstood character, another little bird. It could also serve as a symbol for her secret, her child, Jon Snow.\nNow remember, in the Season 5 episode in which the feather reappears, viewers still think Lyanna had been kidnapped and raped by Prince Rhaegar. It hadn\u2019t been revealed that she and Rhaegar were actually in love, married and had a baby \u2014 a secret that, with her dying breath, she made her brother Ned promise to keep.\nThe connection to Jon is reiterated in that Season 8 teaser when he looks back at the feather.\u00a0Could Cersei\u2019s burning the feather in the scrapped pilot script have been a hint at something else on the way? Will she do the same to Jon?\nWith Dany\u2019s dragons flying around and Cersei having blown up part of King\u2019s Landing with wildfire, it\u2019s not much of a stretch to imagine a fiery run-in between Cersei and Jon in the future.\nThe cut feather scene is perhaps the first small hint of Cersei\u2019s penchant for burning her enemies\u2019 \u201ccities to the ground,\u201d as she likes to say. Considering HBO\u2019s \u201cDragonstone\u201d teaser from late in 2018, which shows a fire engulfing the signature Lannister lion, more flames are likely in the Lannisters\u2019 future. And, just possibly, Jon Snow\u2019s.\n\u00a0\nOne of the more substantial differences between the script at Cushing and the episode that aired on HBO can be observed in the writing of Daenerys Targaryen\u2019s marriage consummation scene.\nIn the Cushing script, Dany has a lot more control. She smiles when she realizes Drogo can say only the word \u201cno\u201d in her language, she helps him take rings out of his hair and, most important, she ultimately consents to sex:\u00a0\nThis is far from the scene that aired on HBO, in which she cries as he undresses her, then has sex with her from behind.\u00a0The more consensual framing of the scene is straight out of Martin\u2019s books, which explains why it was included in an earlier version of the script; the pilot script at Cushing tends to hew closer to Martin\u2019s words.\nThe version of the scene that aired, however, is traumatic. Daenerys is raped. Her relationship with Drogo eventually grows into love, but that doesn\u2019t erase the fact that he raped her \u2014 and does so time and time again.\nShe addresses these rapes in her first conversation with Jon in Season 7, telling him, \u201cI\u2019ve been shamed and betrayed, raped and defiled. Do you know what kept me standing through all those years in exile? Faith, not in any gods, not in myths and legends. In myself, in Daenerys Targaryen.\u201d\nWhy does it matter?\nThough a consensual scene would have been less traumatic to watch, Daenerys actress Emilia Clarke spoke about her character\u2019s rape to Glamour in 2016, explaining some possible reasoning behind the scene:\nA rape scene is hardly necessary to build empathy for Dany\u2019s plight, but as Clarke said, it underscores the terrors Dany overcame and her transformation from a scared, abused child into the khaleesi.\nSomewhere between her rape and her decision to sleep with Jon, aka King of the Squats, in Season 7, a completely different Mother of Dragons has emerged.\n\u00a0\nAfter watching the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d premiere on HBO, fans are well aware that Jaime and Cersei are related. It\u2019s a pretty pivotal plot point. Interestingly, one of the most prominent critiques lodged against the unaired pilot was that this info wasn\u2019t clear enough. Early viewers didn\u2019t know\u00a0Jaime and Cersei Lannister are brother and sister.\nPerhaps that\u2019s why a scene featuring the incestuous siblings talking at King\u2019s Landing was added to the episode that aired. In it, the two basically chat about how very, very related they are and how if anyone discovered their secret affair, their heads would be on spikes.\n\u201cAs your brother, I feel it\u2019s my duty to warn you, you worry too much,\u201d Jaime explicitly states. This scene is not in the Cushing pilot script or the script previously available online, as io9 points out.\nKeeping in mind that many viewers of the original pilot didn\u2019t understand the Lannister twins\u2019 relationship, a scene in the script at Cushing would have made it even more complicated. (Get out of here, Bran. You don\u2019t want to see this.)\nIn all versions of the pilot, Bran Stark climbs the exterior of a tower at Winterfell and happens upon a window, through which he peeps a naked man and woman (Jaime and Cersei). In the script at Cushing, however, the encounter reads slightly differently, with Cersei telling Jaime to stop:\nWhy does it matter?\u00a0\nIn the episode that aired,\u00a0Cersei objects to Jaime only after she spots Bran inadvertently being a little creep in the window.\nIn contrast, in Martin\u2019s book and the script at Cushing, she protests much sooner. It\u2019s confusing to Bran and possibly would\u2019ve been confusing to TV viewers too.\nConsider how this scene would have affected Jaime\u2019s triumphant moment in Season 7, when he chooses to walk away from a power-hungry Cersei. Until that point, audiences are meant to believe he has always been under Cersei\u2019s control; only then is he able to break free from her influence. The Cushing version of Jaime and Cersei\u2019s sex scene could have made this harder to swallow.\nIn a show riddled with constant backstabbing, endless subplots and so many characters you remember as What\u2019s His Name and Who\u2019s Her Face, the less confusing a scene, the better.\n\u00a0\nThe Cushing pilot script opens a lot like the episode that aired: Three men from the Night\u2019s Watch are tracking down wildlings when they are ambushed by White Walkers. Things don\u2019t go well.\nIn the early pilot script, one of those men, Will, realizes the bodies of the dead wildlings have vanished and proceeds to climb a tree to get a better view. He does this right before the Walkers arrive, and his decision is a lifesaving one. In contrast to the aired episode, which shows a Walker sparing a member of the Watch from death for some unknown reason, it\u2019s Will\u2019s position in the tree that prevents him from being killed along with the others.\nThe White Walkers descend on the other two men, all the while speaking a language of ice:\nWill stays in the tree. He\u2019s going to let this one just play out.\nWhy does it matter?\nAt this point, White Walker dialogue is well documented. It just has never shown up on TV. However, it\u2019s in the books, it\u2019s referred to by Vanity Fair writer Joanna Robinson\u00a0after she reviewed a number of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d scripts, it shows up in the pilot script floating around online and it\u2019s also in the one from Martin\u2019s collection at Cushing.\nI asked \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d language creator David Peterson about the White Walker dialogue, which he named Skroth, in a previously unpublished portion of a 2017 interview.\nReflecting on early plans for the White Walkers to speak, he told me he originally put something together for the opening scene of the show.\nPeterson sent me a pre-effects example of the White Walker dialogue, which he previously played at conventions and gave us permission to include. Here\u2019s an early version of what a White Walker would\u2019ve sounded like:\nAt the time, he said, \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d sound designer Paula Fairfield was still hopeful they could use it one day, but that obviously hasn\u2019t happened.\nIt\u2019s not the only language casualty. Peterson said he created a full language for the Children of the Forest in Season 6, but for a variety of reasons (a desire to avoid the need for subtitles during action sequences, stunt people having difficulty with their lines), they\u00a0\u201cwere either cut or shortened, and all of them were turned into English.\u201d\n\u201cIt was an idea. They tried it. It just didn\u2019t work,\u201d he said.\n\u00a0\nIn the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d pilot that aired, Jon does not make an appearance in the memorable great hall scene. Instead, he stays outside, heeding Catelyn Stark\u2019s wishes that Jon \u2014 who she and almost everyone else believes is Ned\u2019s bastard son \u2014 not be present.\nBut in the pilot script at Cushing, he sits inside. He\u2019s not at the highborn table, but he manages to have a drunken conversation with Benjen Stark in the great hall anyway.\nOur guy is left alone to drink more wine and eventually causes a scene:\nThe scene in the Cushing pilot script is almost exactly the same as the scene in Martin\u2019s novel\u00a0A Game of Thrones.\u00a0From the book:\nBeyond the exclusion of Snow\u2019s drunken escapade, the Cushing version of the sequence was drastically rearranged to form the scenes that aired on HBO. For example, in the episode that aired, the confrontation between Ned and Jaime in the great hall ends after Ned says, \u201cI don\u2019t fight in tournaments because when I fight a man for real, I don\u2019t want him to know what I can do.\u201d\nJaime replies, \u201cWell said.\u201d\nBut in the Cushing pilot script, as well as the one that has been online, the moment continues long enough for Jaime to remind Ned of how his brother and father were killed:\nIt continues:\nA flashback of Ned\u2019s brother Brandon being killed also purportedly existed in an early version of the filmed pilot (a\u00a0screenshot exists online), but this is not included in the script at Cushing (though it could have fit in around this conversation).\u00a0\nThe Cushing version of the scene goes even further, with Ned leaving and Tyrion, who overheard everything, telling Jaime, \u201cIf it came down to it, Brother, I\u2019d bet on you \u2015 but I wouldn\u2019t bet much.\u201d Tyrion then downs another tankard of wine, realizes he drank too much, staggers out of the hall and eventually talks to Jon outside.\nWhy does it matter?\nWhile it would\u2019ve been fun to see the future King in the North get shitfaced (you know nothing about holding your alcohol, Jon Snow), it\u2019s so much extra character interaction to digest that you could be left feeling as dizzy as Tyrion.\u00a0\nThere are a few moments that are really important from the Winterfell feast scenes, and Jon\u2019s conversations with Tyrion and Benjen are at the forefront.\u00a0The conversation with Tyrion is referred to in Season 7, when Tyrion writes Jon a letter that includes \u201cAll dwarves are bastards in their father\u2019s eyes.\u201d It\u2019s a line Tyrion says in their first chat, and it seemingly convinces Jon he\u2019ll be safe when he travels to see Daenerys.\nOf course, with Benjen he talks about going to serve in the Night\u2019s Watch at the Wall, which he clearly does and then lives happily ever after.\u00a0\nThe other character interactions, while entertaining, could have distracted from the truly important moments, so let\u2019s all pour one out for Jon\u2019s long-lost wasted scene.\n\u00a0\nCatelyn and Daenerys\u00a0were originally played by different actors \u2014 Jennifer Ehle and Tamzin Merchant, respectively.\u00a0Before Michelle Fairley took on the role of Catelyn, the character\u2019s personality was a lot different too.\nFor example, in a bedroom scene in the pilot script, Catelyn urges Ned to accept Robert\u2019s offer of betrothal between Joffrey and Sansa and to head south with the king.\nMaester Luwin then enters with the note from her sister Lysa, saying that the Lannisters murdered her husband, Jon Arryn. Ned has no choice but to take up his old friend Robert\u2019s request to be the new Hand of the King and go to King\u2019s Landing to figure out what\u2019s going on.\nIn the episode that aired, however, Catelyn urges Ned to stay in the North, claiming that she\u2019ll confront Robert and tell him, \u201cListen, fat man. You are not taking my husband anywhere. He belongs to me now.\u201d\nYou tell \u2019em, Cat.\nWhy does it matter?\nIn terms of the differences between the pilot script at Cushing and the episode that aired, Catelyn is my pick for most improved character. Benioff and Weiss were smart to realize that fans have pages and pages to get to know the Catelyn in the books but only a few scenes to get to know her on the show. The Cushing script might have made Catelyn seem a bit title obsessed, like Season 1 Sansa, who was, objectively, the worst.\nJust ask Season 1 Arya Stark.\nInstead, the showrunners chose to lean into the image of the Stark matriarch as a protective mother and wife who would later fend off an assassin in an effort to save her injured Bran.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that after reading Lysa\u2019s letter in the Cushing script, Catelyn says to Ned:\nIn the episode that aired, Catelyn stops after saying Jon Arryn was murdered by the Lannisters. She doesn\u2019t say, \u201cBy the queen.\u201d\nJohn Standing, the actor who plays the dearly departed Jon Arryn, once said the original pilot included a \u201clunatic\u201d scene in which Cersei watches his character die. Though this scene isn\u2019t included in the script at Cushing, a line about Jon Arryn being killed by the queen paves the way for the bit to have been added later.\n\u00a0\nWhen \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d begins, you don\u2019t realize Joffrey is quite as turdish as he is until Episode 2, when Tyrion slaps him silly for not going to the Starks to offer sympathies after Bran\u2019s fall. But in the pilot script at Cushing, you get the impression that Joffrey is a walking, talking pile of human excrement right away.\nAt a training session between the Lannisters and Starks, Bran has just finished pummeling Tommen Baratheon with a wooden sword, and Ser Rodrik, Winterfell\u2019s master-at-arms, asks Robb Stark and Joffrey if they\u2019d like to go another round. Robb\u2019s in, but Joffrey complains that he\u2019s\u00a0\u201ctired of swatting at Starks with a play sword.\u201d He suggests \u201clive steel,\u201d and Rodrik is just not cool with that.\nWhile the pilot script gives Robb this early interaction with Joffrey, it omits many other scenes that made their way to air \u2014 the Winterfell scene where\u00a0Bran is learning archery with his family, the scene in which Sansa and Arya are practicing their stitching, the scene in which Sansa begs Catelyn to let her go to King\u2019s Landing\u00a0and the infamous shaving scene in which the Stark boys stand around shirtless and flexing.\nWhy does it matter?\nThe Joffrey moment could have added tension later in the series \u2014 for instance, during the War of the Five Kings skit at Joffrey\u2019s wedding, which features someone riding around with a wolf\u2019s head to represent the decapitated Robb. But it seems likely that some minor scenes like this were cut in order to make room for more vital moments, such as getting to know the Starks. And, frankly, more Starks and less Joffrey sounds like a winning formula, bare-chested flexing and all.\nIn addition to the cut scenes, there were quite a few subtle differences between the script available online and the one from Martin\u2019s official collection in Texas. In the version online, Tyrion pets the Stark direwolf Ghost, his brothel scene takes place at King\u2019s Landing (not in the North), and there\u2019s a long scene meant to describe a now-discarded title sequence.\nBut none of this happens in the script at the Cushing library. (In fact, as far as the credits go, the script there describes an opening sequence with just the words \u201cTITLE CARD: GAME OF THRONES.\u201d)\nThere are some less significant but amusing details sandwiched into the script at Cushing too. Ned, who\u2019s about the grimmest dude around, makes a joke in the crypts:\nThe line was taken out and given to Jaime in Season 1, Episode 3:\u00a0\nVarious shooting locations changed as well. For instance, Dany\u2019s wedding was originally filmed in Morocco and featured a cameo from Martin himself as a Pentoshi (something that could have easily fit into the Cushing script, since it mentions \u201cMerchants of Pentos\u201d gathered for the ceremony). However, when Clarke was brought in as the replacement Daenerys, the subplot was altered and reshot in Malta.\nThe Cushing script alone doesn\u2019t reveal exactly why the original pilot was such a \u201cmassive problem,\u201d as Mazin put it.\u00a0Kit Harington, who plays Jon Snow, touched on\u00a0that version\u2019s \u201cmistakes,\u201d telling The Guardian,\u00a0\u201cIt didn\u2019t look right, didn\u2019t feel right.\u201d The devil is likely in the scene execution details, which we might never see, although he said the showrunners would threaten to release the pilot on YouTube when he pissed them off. Perhaps the early drunk scenes weren\u2019t the King in the North\u2019s finest hour.\nStill, reading the script at Cushing, I got a sense of how even small changes would have led to a vastly different show. One of the most interesting aspects for me \u2015 a moment that would\u2019ve changed the way some future \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d scenes unfold and added some foreshadowing \u2015 was Cersei\u2019s cut scene. As the adage goes,\u00a0where there\u2019s smoke, there\u2019s ... Cersei trying to light something on fire.\nThe scenes illustrated by Lena Vargas Afanasieva are not meant to be exact depictions of the scripted sequences.\nAdditional reporting by Leigh Blickley and Sara Boboltz.", "date": "\n02/09/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/game-of-thrones-unaired-pilot_n_5c0af138e4b0ab8cf6934dbe", "tags": "cersei happens pilot aired scene script never season \u201d terrible jon original thrones cushing"}
