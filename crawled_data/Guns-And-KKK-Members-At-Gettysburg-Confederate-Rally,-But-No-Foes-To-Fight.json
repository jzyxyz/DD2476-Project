{"title": "Guns And KKK Members At Gettysburg Confederate Rally, But No Foes To Fight", "content": "GETTYSBURG, Pa. \u2015 A few hundred armed militia group members, Sons of Confederate Veterans, Ku Klux Klaners, supporters of President Donald Trump, and other self-described patriots descended upon the Gettysburg battlefield Saturday to defend the site\u2019s Confederate symbols from phantom activists with the violent far-left group Antifa.\nSome carried semi-automatic rifles \u2015 permitted in Pennsylvania \u2015 as they peered out across the battlefield with binoculars, on the lookout for the black-clad, face-masked anti-fascists, anarchists and socialists they said they had heard were traveling to the national park to dishonor Confederate graves, monuments and flags. \nAlthough many came expecting violence \u2015 even after Antifa made it clear its adherents never planned to show up \u2015 the only bloodshed came when a lone militia group member accidentally shot himself in the leg.\nIn the two years since white supremacist and Confederate flag admirer Dylann Roof massacred nine black parishioners at a South Carolina church, the movement to remove Confederate symbols from public property has gained renewed purpose and momentum. So far, 60 Confederate symbols have been removed from city- and state-owned land across the U.S., according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. Most recently, the city of New Orleans toppled four statues honoring the Confederacy. \nThis has incensed and energized militia groups and white supremacists across the country, who claim Confederate symbols represent heritage and history, not hate. In May, white supremacists showed up with torches at a monument to Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee in Charlottesville, Virginia, after the city moved to take it down. \nSaturday\u2019s rally in Gettysburg showed pro-Confederate activists increasingly agitated, armed, and itching for a fight \u2015 even when there is no one to clash with them. \nOnce a storm had passed through and the sweltering July sun returned, they gathered on the battlefield here just north of the headquarters of Union Army General George Meade, whose army repelled the Confederacy in the Civil War\u2019s most decisive battle.\nAfter singing the National Anthem and performing the Pledge of Allegiance, the hundreds of Southern Army enthusiasts \u2015 many of whom wore Trump pins, hats or T-shirts \u2015 took a moment to honor the Confederate flag. \n\u201cI salute the Confederate flag,\u201d they said in unison, \u201cwith affection, reverence and undying devotion to the cause for which it stands.\u201d\nBilly Snuffer, who identified himself as the Imperial Wizard for the Rebel Brigade of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, told HuffPost that there were KKK members scattered across the battlefield to \u201caid law enforcement\u201d and protect the area\u2019s 20 or so Confederate monuments from Antifa.\u00a0\n\u201cThe Confederate battle flag has nothing to do with slavery,\u201d he said, standing in the same area where 154 years ago the Confederate Army marched into town, abducting free black Americans and sending them to the South to be sold into slavery.\n\u201cThis is our history, this is our heritage,\u201d the Martinsville, Virginia, resident said of the monuments.\nIn mid-June, rumors had spread online that Antifa, a decentralized group known for violently confronting white supremacists and hate groups, planned to burn a Confederate flag and desecrate Confederate gravestones in Gettysburg on July 1, the date the three-day battle began in 1863. \nThe rumors mobilized various far-right groups, who secured permits from the National Park Service to show up en masse to the battlefield, setting the stage for what they thought would be a dramatic showdown between the opposing fringe elements of U.S. politics. \nBut the central Pennsylvania chapter of Antifa told local newspapers\u00a0last week that it never intended to gather at Gettysburg. \nThe rumors, the group told HuffPost in a Facebook message, were the work of online trolls. One such tale said Antifa members were going to urinate on Confederate gravestones. One problem: There aren\u2019t any Confederate gravestones to desecrate. Although some Confederate soldiers are buried at Gettysburg, their final resting places aren\u2019t marked.\nStill, efforts to quell the rumors didn\u2019t stop anti-government militia groups from across the country \u2015 including West Virginia, Michigan, Nebraska and California \u2015 from showing up Saturday.\u00a0\n\u201cOur main purpose is just to defend the historical parts of the city here and stop them from being destroyed and keep people who aren\u2019t part of anything ... safe,\u201d said a 27-year-old who would give his name only as Thor and who said he was a veteran of the war in Afghanistan.\nHe said he was aware that Antifa likely wasn\u2019t going to show, but that he felt compelled to be there, just in case. \nThor, a Gettysburg-area resident and member of the anti-government militia group the Three Percenters, wore an ammunition belt around a bulletproof vest. The sleeves of his camouflage uniform were rolled up, revealing the word \u201cINFIDEL\u201d tattooed to his arm. \nAsked what he thought about all the Confederate symbols being removed from public property across the U.S., Thor didn\u2019t mince words. \n\u201cIt pisses me off,\u201d he said. \nThe assembled groups\u2019 hatred for Antifa Saturday was surpassed only by their anger at the growing movement to remove Confederate symbols from public property.\nTed Fields, a Sons of Confederate Veterans leader wearing a black leather biker vest, addressed the crowd using a megaphone and asserted that the dismantling of Confederate monuments could lead to the decimation of America itself. \n\u201cI believe their master plan is once they get us used to taking down some monuments here and there in some liberal cities, then they\u2019re gonna try it out here and see if that works,\u201d he said. \n\u201cThe next thing you know, they\u2019re going to take our Constitution and say you know what? That was written by slave-holders, it\u2019s racist, let\u2019s get rid of it and become a communist nation. I don\u2019t want that on my watch.\u201d\nThe crowd cheered.\nA woman named Jenny Lee, who claimed to be Robert E. Lee\u2019s 3rd great grandniece, implored the crowd not to be bowed by political correctness. \n\u201cWe must never back down or be intimidated by the antics of the ignorant,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd all the safety-pin-wearing, easily offended, butt-hurt, temper-tantrum-throwing, vagina-hat-wearing, face-covered, commie fascists can kiss my ass.\u201d\nLee was forceful in telling the crowd that the Confederacy \u2015 and by extension, everyone gathered at the rally \u2015 wasn\u2019t racist. The Civil War, she said, wasn\u2019t about slavery. (It was.) \nPlus, she added to great applause, thousands of blacks fought for the South, neglecting to mention that they were forced to do so.\nAs the rally concluded, the sound of cannons could be heard in the distance, as Civil War re-enactors not associated with the pro-Confederate rally shot off blank rounds, smoke billowing out across a different part of the battlefield. Actors in blue and gray uniforms played dead and injured. \nBut the only person actually shot Saturday in Gettysburg with a real bullet was a 23-year-old militia group member named Benjamin Hornberger, of Shippensburg, Pennsylvania. According to U.S. Park police, Hornberger triggered his revolver when the flag pole he was carrying bumped against his gun holster. The bullet went into his leg. Police say officers quickly applied a tourniquet, likely saving his life. \u00a0\nAccording to PennLive, Hornberger talked to paramedics and \u201cseemed in good spirits.\u201d\nAmerica does not do a good job of tracking incidents of hate and bias.
