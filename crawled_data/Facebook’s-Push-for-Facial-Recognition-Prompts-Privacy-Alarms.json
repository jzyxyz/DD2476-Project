{"title": "Facebook\u2019s Push for Facial Recognition Prompts Privacy Alarms", "content": "When Facebook rolled out facial recognition tools in the European Union this year, it promoted the technology as a way to help people safeguard their online identities.\n\u201cFace recognition technology allows us to help protect you from a stranger using your photo to impersonate you,\u201d Facebook told its users in Europe.\nIt was a risky move by the social network. Six years earlier, it had deactivated the technology in Europe after regulators there raised questions about its facial recognition consent system. Now, Facebook was reintroducing the service as part of an update of its user permission process in Europe.\nYet Facebook is taking a huge reputational risk in aggressively pushing the technology at a time when its data-mining practices are under heightened scrutiny in the United States and Europe. Already, more than a dozen privacy and consumer groups, and at least a few officials, argue that the company\u2019s use of facial recognition has violated people\u2019s privacy by not obtaining appropriate user consent.\nThe complaints add to the barrage of criticism facing the Silicon Valley giant over its handling of users\u2019 personal details. Several American government agencies are currently investigating Facebook\u2019s response to the harvesting of its users\u2019 data by Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm.\nFacebook\u2019s push to spread facial recognition also puts the company at the center of a broader and intensifying debate about how the powerful technology should be handled. The technology can be used to remotely identify people by name without their knowledge or consent. While proponents view it as a high-tech tool to catch criminals, civil liberties experts warn it could enable a mass surveillance system.\nFacial recognition works by scanning faces of unnamed people in photos or videos and then matching codes of their facial patterns to those in a database of named people. Facebook has said that users are in charge of that process, telling them: \u201cYou control face recognition.\u201d\nBut critics said people cannot actually control the technology \u2014 because Facebook scans their faces in photos even when their facial recognition setting is turned off.\n\u201cFacebook tries to explain their practices in ways that make Facebook look like the good guy, that they are somehow protecting your privacy,\u201d said Jennifer Lynch, a senior staff attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t get at the fact that they are scanning every photo.\u201d\nRochelle Nadhiri, a Facebook spokeswoman, said its system analyzes faces in users\u2019 photos to check whether they match with those who have their facial recognition setting turned on. If the system cannot find a match, she said, it does not identify the unknown face and immediately deletes the facial data.\nAt the heart of the issue is Facebook\u2019s approach to user consent.\nIn the European Union, a tough new data protection law called the General Data Protection Regulation now requires companies to obtain explicit and \u201cfreely given\u201d consent before collecting sensitive information like facial data. Some critics, including the former government official who originally proposed the new law, contend that Facebook tried to improperly influence user consent by promoting facial recognition as an identity protection tool.\n\u201cFacebook is somehow threatening me that, if I do not buy into face recognition, I will be in danger,\u201d said Viviane Reding, the former justice commissioner of the European Commission who is now a member of the European Parliament. \u201cIt goes completely against the European law because it tries to manipulate consent.\u201d\nEuropean regulators also have concerns about Facebook\u2019s facial recognition practices. In Ireland, where Facebook\u2019s international headquarters are, a spokeswoman for the Data Protection Commission said regulators \u201chave put a number of specific queries to Facebook in respect of this technology.\u201d Regulators were assessing Facebook\u2019s responses, she said.\nIn the United States, Facebook is fighting a lawsuit brought by Illinois residents claiming the company\u2019s face recognition practices violated a state privacy law. Damages in the case, certified as a class action in April, could amount to billions of dollars. In May, an appeals court granted Facebook\u2019s request to delay the trial and review the class certification order.\nNikki Sokol, associate general counsel at Facebook, said in a statement, \u201cThis lawsuit is without merit and we will defend ourselves vigorously.\u201d\nSeparately, privacy and consumer groups lodged a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission in April saying Facebook added facial recognition services, like the feature to help identify impersonators, without obtaining prior consent from people before turning it on. The groups argued that Facebook violated a 2011 consent decree that prohibits it from deceptive privacy practices.\n\u201cFacebook routinely makes misrepresentations to induce consumers to adopt wider and more pervasive uses of facial recognition technology,\u201d the complaint said.\nMs. Nadhiri said Facebook had designed its consent process to comply with the new European law and had previewed its approach with European regulators. As to the privacy groups\u2019 complaint, she said the social network had notified users about expanded facial recognition services.\n\u201cWe provide clear information to people about how we use face recognition technology,\u201d Ms. Nadhiri wrote in an email. The company\u2019s recently updated privacy section, she added, \u201cshows people how the setting works in simple language.\u201d\nFacebook is hardly the only tech giant to embrace facial recognition technology. Over the last few years, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft have filed facial recognition patent applications.\nIn May, civil liberties groups criticized Amazon for marketing facial technology, called Rekognition, to police departments. The company has said the technology has also been used to find lost children at amusement parks and other purposes. (The New York Times has also used Amazon\u2019s technology, including for the recent royal wedding.)\nCritics said Facebook took an early lead in consumer facial recognition services partly by turning on the technology as the default option for users. In 2010, it introduced a photo-labeling feature called Tag Suggestions that used face-matching software to suggest the names of people in users\u2019 photos.\nPeople could turn it off. But privacy experts said Facebook had neither obtained users\u2019 opt-in consent for the technology nor explicitly informed them that the company could benefit from scanning their photos.\n\u201cWhen Tag Suggestions asks you \u2018Is this Jill?\u2019 you don\u2019t think you are annotating faces to improve Facebook\u2019s face recognition algorithm,\u201d said Brian Brackeen, the chief executive of Kairos, a facial recognition company. \u201cEven the premise is an unfair use of people\u2019s time and labor.\u201d\nThe huge trove of identified faces, he added, enabled Facebook to quickly develop one of the world\u2019s most powerful commercial facial recognition engines. In 2014, Facebook researchers said  they had trained face-matching software \u201con the largest facial dataset to date, an identity labeled dataset of four million facial images.\u201d\nMs. Nadhiri said Facebook had consulted with privacy experts on its photo-tagging feature. It also recently notified users in the United States who had the site\u2019s face-identification services turned on that they could turn them off, she said. \u201cWe have always respected people\u2019s choices,\u201d she said.\nBut Facebook may only be getting started with its facial recognition services. The social network has applied for various patents, many of them still under consideration, which show how it could use the technology to track its online users in the real world.\nOne patent application, published last November, described a system that could detect consumers within stores and match those shoppers\u2019 faces with their social networking profiles. Then it could analyze the characteristics of their friends, and other details, using the information to determine a \u201ctrust level\u201d for each shopper. Consumers deemed \u201ctrustworthy\u201d could be eligible for special treatment, like automatic access to merchandise in locked display cases, the document said.\nAnother Facebook patent filing described how cameras near checkout counters could capture shoppers\u2019 faces, match them with their social networking profiles and then send purchase confirmation messages to their phones.\nIn their F.T.C. complaint, privacy groups \u2014 led by the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit research institution \u2014 said the patent filings showed how Facebook could make money from users\u2019 faces. A previous EPIC complaint about Facebook helped precipitate a consent decree requiring the company to give users more control over their personal details.\n\u201cFacebook\u2019s patent applications attest to the company\u2019s primary commercial purposes in expanding its biometric data collection and the pervasive uses of facial recognition technology that it envisions for the near future,\u201d the current complaint said.\nMs. Nadhiri said that Facebook often sought patents for technology it never put into effect and that patent filings were not an indication of the company\u2019s plans.\nBut legal filings in the class-action suit hint at the technology\u2019s importance to Facebook\u2019s business.\nThe case was brought by Illinois consumers who said that Facebook collected and stored their facial data without their explicit, prior consent \u2014 in violation, they claim, of a state biometric privacy law.\nIf the suit were to move forward, Facebook\u2019s lawyers argued in a recent court document, \u201cthe reputational and economic costs to Facebook will be irreparable.\u201d", "date": "July 9, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/09/technology/facebook-facial-recognition-privacy.html", "tags": "users privacy alarms facial recognition \u201d facebook prompts push technology"}
