{"title": "The Hypocrisy Of Trump Saying Rep- Ilhan Omar Should Resign Over Anti-Semitism", "content": "No stranger to hypocrisy, President Donald Trump\u00a0told reporters Tuesday morning that Rep. llhan Omar (D-Minn.) should either resign from Congress or step down from a House committee assignment over recent tweets some lawmakers decried as anti-Semitic.\nHis sharp criticism of Omar is ironic given how many times Trump has made anti-Semitic comments or hesitated to denounce such rhetoric in the past. Here are some of the most egregious examples.\u00a0\nTrump notably did not call on Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) to resign after the congressman questioned what was so offensive about \u201cwhite supremacy,\u201d the ideology at the heart of the Holocaust and other anti-Semitic movements throughout history, during a January interview with The New York Times.\u00a0\nTrump\u2019s silence came despite many top House Republicans calling for the Iowa lawmaker to step down. Few were willing to give King the benefit of the doubt, given his long history of racist sentiments and links to neo-Nazi movements.\u00a0\nDuring his 2016 campaign, Trump tweeted a blatantly anti-Semitic image featuring a picture of Hillary Clinton pasted over a backdrop of $100 bills with a six-pointed star \u2014 the Jewish Star of David \u2014 alongside her face.\nCritics quickly raised alarm over the image. Using the symbol over a pile of money, they said, is blatantly anti-Semitic and reinforces hateful stereotypes of Jewish greed.\nThough Trump insisted that the photo was harmless and was supposed to be seen as a sheriff\u2019s badge \u2015 not the star that Nazis forced Jews to sew onto their clothing during World War II \u2015 some internet sleuthing by\u00a0Mic\u00a0revealed that the image was actually created by white supremacists and had appeared on a neo-Nazi forum shortly before Trump tweeted it.\u00a0\nAfter a massive white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, left one counter-protester dead in August 2017, Trump took more than 48 hours to denounce the violence and initially said there was an \u201cegregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on\u00a0many sides.\u201d\u00a0\nWhite supremacists celebrated Trump\u2019s reaction as a victory. On The Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi website, users wrote that \u201cTrump comments were good\u201d and claimed he \u201csaid he loves us all.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nTrump\u2019s hesitant response was no surprise given how long it took him to denounce the support of his presidential candidacy by former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke, an admitted anti-Semite.\u00a0", "date": "\n02/12/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-ilhan-omar-anti-semitism-hypocrisy_n_5c63358de4b08da0ec7fbfd1", "tags": "anti-semitic given saying many denounce anti-semitism image neo-nazi omar white trump resign ilhan rep- hypocrisy"}
