{"title": "Burger King \u2018O.K. Google\u2019 Ad Doesn\u2019t Seem O.K. With Google", "content": "Google appeared to stymie a marketing stunt on Wednesday by Burger King, which had introduced a television ad intended to prompt voice-activated Google devices to describe its burgers.\nA video from a Burger King marketing agency showed the plan in action: \u201cYou\u2019re watching a 15-second Burger King ad, which is unfortunately not enough time to explain all the fresh ingredients in the Whopper sandwich,\u201d the actor in the commercial said. \u201cBut I got an idea. O.K. Google, what is the Whopper burger?\u201d\nPrompted by the phrase \u201cO.K. Google,\u201d the Google Home device beside the TV in the video lit up, searched the phrase on Wikipedia and stated the ingredients.\nBut within hours of the ad\u2019s release \u2014 and humorous edits to the Whopper Wikipedia page by mischievous users \u2014 tests from The Verge and BuzzFeed showed that the commercial had stopped activating the device.\nBurger King, which did not work with Google on the ad, said Google appeared to make changes by Wednesday afternoon that stopped the commercial from waking the devices, in what amounted to an unusual form of corporate warfare in the living room. Google, which previously said it had not been consulted on the campaign, did not respond to requests for comment.\nIt was unclear if Burger King can alter some of the ads, which were to air on Wednesday during \u201cThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,\u201d \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d and other shows, to work around any changes.\nBurger King\u2019s tactic, while novel, raised eyebrows, particularly as more Americans use smart speakers at home, a trend led by Amazon\u2019s Echo device and its virtual assistant, Alexa. While internet-connected gadgets have been praised for the screen-free convenience they offer, they have also raised questions about security and privacy.\nBob Gilbreath, chief of Ahalogy, a marketing technology company in Cincinnati, said Burger King\u2019s stunt posed a risk to Google, which introduced Home in November, given that such appliances are \u201cnew and unknown to the vast majority of people.\u201d\n\u201cMost people don\u2019t trust advertising, and having advertisers continually listen to what happens in our homes is scary,\u201d he said.\nAmazon and Google have said that their speakers only process people\u2019s speech after registering certain \u201cwake words,\u201d such as \u201cAlexa\u201d or \u201cO.K. Google,\u201d which is what Burger King exploited.\n\u201cWith the onset of consumers buying intelligent system devices and using them at home, we thought this was a good way to make a connection and go directly to guests and tell a story about our product,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Cil, president of Burger King, said in an interview Wednesday morning.\nAsked whether he was concerned that consumers might find the advertisement invasive, Mr. Cil said, \u201cWe think about our guests\u2019 perception and their perspective on how we interact with them, but on balance we felt this was a really positive way to connect with them.\u201d\nThe Whopper ad was the second example of a marketer using Home in the last month, which is of note because Google is the largest seller of advertising on the internet. A few weeks ago, some devices apparently played brief, unexpected promotions for \u201cBeauty and the Beast,\u201d a new Disney movie, after the weather forecast and commuting conditions.\nA Google spokeswoman said the Disney promotion \u201cwasn\u2019t intended to be an ad,\u201d and was part of a feature that provides daily information to Google Home users and sometimes shares \u201ctimely content.\u201d She added, \u201cWe\u2019re continuing to experiment with new ways to surface unique content for users, and we could have done better in this case.\u201d\nMore often, companies are trying to avoid waking devices through the television. Google accidentally set off some speakers recently with its Super Bowl commercial. In January, a television news station\u2019s report on a 6-year-old girl\u2019s accidental purchase of a dollhouse through Amazon Echo used the name \u201cAlexa,\u201d and inadvertently set off its own round of attempted orders from viewers.\nAmazon, which has run many TV ads that use the name \u201cAlexa,\u201d said by email, \u201cGiven the nature of far-field wake-word technology, live discussions about Echo and Alexa can trigger an on-device response.\u201d It said it alters Alexa ads to \u201cminimize Echo devices falsely responding in customer\u2019s homes.\u201d", "date": "April 12, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/12/business/burger-king-tv-ad-google-home.html", "tags": "devices ad \u2018 burger home \u201d o.k seem alexa king google"}
