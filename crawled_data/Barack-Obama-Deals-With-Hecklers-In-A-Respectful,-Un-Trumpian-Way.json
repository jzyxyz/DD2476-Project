{"title": "Barack Obama Deals With Hecklers In A Respectful, Un-Trumpian Way", "content": "President Donald Trump could learn a thing or two from former President Barack Obama about how to handle hecklers.\nTrump has infamously encouraged supporters to \u201cknock the crap\u201d out of people who protest him at rallies. Obama showed how it should be done Friday, however, when he was heckled while stumping for Democratic candidates Bill Nelson and Andrew Gillum in Miami, Florida, ahead of Tuesday\u2019s midterms.\n\u201cSir, sir, don\u2019t curse in front of kids, come on. Don\u2019t do that in front of them, come on,\u201d Obama calmly told one heckler.\n\u201cWe\u2019re OK, we\u2019re OK, we\u2019re OK,\u201d Obama continued, after the unidentified person was reportedly removed by security and the crowd stopped chanting the ex-POTUS\u2019 name.\n\u201cYou know what? This is what I look forward to, is having a few hecklers to get me back in the mood. You know, it\u2019s like, I enjoy that. You always gotta have a few in order to know that you\u2019re on the campaign trail,\u201d he said.\nObama used similar tactics to thwart a second heckler, who interrupted his comments on health care.\n\u201cHold on a second. Sir, sir. Here\u2019s the deal, if you support the other candidates, then you should go support the other candidates. Don\u2019t be here,\u201d said Obama, before telling the heckler to not \u201ccome hollering here.\u201d", "date": "\n11/03/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/barack-obama-hecklers-florida-trump_n_5bdd9c0de4b01ffb1d029a29", "tags": "deals know candidates heckler come way un-trumpian \u201d ok obama barack sir hecklers respectful"}
