Not only am I eager to discuss the issues with you, I\u2019m willing to offer $10,000 to your campaign today for you to come on our Sunday special.\u201d\nShapiro fired back at Ocasio-Cortez following her tweet on Thursday, saying \u201cslandering someone as a sexist catcaller without reason or evidence does demonstrate cowardice and bad intent.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m sure your media sycophants will eat it up,\u201d he concluded.\nOcasio-Cortez, 28, won a stunning victory over 10-term incumbent Rep. Joe Crowley in the Democratic primary in June. She\u2019s campaigned on several major progressive promises, including \u201cMedicare for all\u201d and the abolishment of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.", "date": "\n08/10/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-conservative-commentator-ben-shapiro_n_5b6d3267e4b0bdd06208193c", "tags": "debate alexandria twitter commentator- slams owe \u201d ocasio-cortez issues conservative back shapiro response commentator"}
