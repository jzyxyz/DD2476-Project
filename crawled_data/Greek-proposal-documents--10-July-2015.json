The new fiscal path is premised on a primary surplus target of (1, 2, 3), and 3.5 percent of GDP in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018. The package includes VAT reforms (\u00b62), other tax policy measures (\u00b63), pension reforms (\u00b64), public administration reforms (\u00b65), reforms addressing shortfalls in tax collection enforcement (\u00b66), and other parametric measures as specified below.\n2. VAT reform\nAdopt legislation to reform the VAT system that will be effective as of July 1, 2015.

This will be completed by end-2016, as appropriate and targeted fiscally neutral measures to compensate those inhabitants that are most in need are determined. The new VAT rates on hotels and islands will be implemented from October 2015.\nThe increase of the VAT rate described above may be reviewed at the end of 2016, provided that equivalent additional revenues are collected through measures taken against tax evasion and to improve collectability of VAT.
