{"title": "Inside the world of Ghana's internet fraudsters", "content": "Internet fraudsters in Ghana are easy to spot. The young men in fast cars have become such a conspicuous group that they even have their own nickname. Meet the Sakawa boys.\nDavid is 25 years old. He's been defrauding people on the internet for the last two years. \n\"I know it's wrong but it gives me a lot of money,\" he says.\nHe used to sleep on the streets. Then he saw his friends in internet cafes earning money defrauding people online. \nA typical con is pretending to be a woman romantically interested in men from Europe, America or Asia.   \nHe learnt the trade and, with little formal education, earned enough money to rent an apartment, buy a car and have money left over to spend. \nBut he insists the money isn't earned easily. \n\"Some say this work is easy but it is not.\"\n\"You have to be patient, smart, fast and cultivate trust between you and the white person\". \nFraudsters like David (not his real name) pretend to be beautiful women. They play clips of the women saying hello. They then tell their targets that their microphone or speakers aren't working so they can't speak, they can only communicate via messages.\nOver time they build up a romantic relationship with them before convincing them to send them money.\nOthers pretend to have a concession in gold, timber, securities or oil to persuade people to hand over money for their fake business arrangements.\nThe group of fraudsters have come to be known as the Sakawa boys in Ghana, a term which means \"putting inside\" in the Hausa language.\nIt's not just a living, but a lifestyle. \nSakawa boys are so renowned in Ghana that a primary school pupil can point one out - their lavish lifestyle gives them away.\nThey can be spotted on a Saturday night in Santa Marie, a suburb of Ghana's capital Accra. \nThe streets are filled with unlicensed Range Rovers and Toyota Camrys. \nYoung men in tight jeans, baseball caps and flashes of gold sit with their car windows wound down and play loud music.\nA decade ago the term Sakawa was not even used in Ghana. Instead internet fraudsters were called Yahoo boys - a term mostly used for conmen in Nigeria.\nThe Nigerian singer Olu Maintain released the song Yahooze in 2007.  In the song he says \"it's all about the Benjamins baby\", referring to hundred dollar bills. And at gigs he started spraying money at fans.\nHe said in an interview with Modern Ghana at the time \"nobody is interested in how you got to where you are. Everybody is interested in results\".\nAlthough he said in the same interview \"the song has nothing to do with yahoo\".\nNow the term Sakawa boy has taken over in Ghana. There is even a collection of Sakawa boy films, whose storylines often reference the use of black magic.\nOne reason they have taken off in Ghana is that it has one of the highest internet penetration rates in Africa.\nSakawa boys are not just conspicuous consumers. \nSome claim they also wield considerable influence.\nThe Ghanaian Times reports that a government minister complained that chiefs \"condone and connive with such criminals\" - referring to Sakawa boys. \nNorthern Region Minister Alhaji Limuna Mohammed Muniru said he had received a death threat after issuing a directive to arrest some Sakawa boys. \nThe same minister also claimed some of the conmen had bribed a chief to rename his town either Galaxy City or La Palmas.\nThe negative effect of Sakawa boys' cons is felt across the country. \nCybercrime contributed to Ghana being blacklisted for money-laundering by the international watchdog the global Financial Action Task Force in 2012. This dented the country's international reputation as an investment destination. \nThe government says those who have been victims of Ghana's conmen should lodge formal complaints but so far, there have been few convictions - partly because of the difficulty prosecuting this type of crime, with the victims living abroad.\nDavid recognises that being a conman doesn't help his own reputation either. But the money is too much of a lure for him to make a career change any time soon.", "date": "10 May 2015", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-32583161", "tags": "sakawa boys world fraudsters even david inside money ghana men internet term"}
