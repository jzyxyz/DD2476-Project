{"title": "Should We Be Anticipating War With Iran? No, but It Could Get Nasty", "content": "The escalating invective between President Trump and Iran\u2019s leaders, reminiscent of the president\u2019s bombastic exchanges with North Korea, have raised fears of a military confrontation in the Persian Gulf \u2014 a vital conduit for global oil supplies \u2014 or perhaps even something bigger.\nIn a late-night Twitter message, Mr. Trump warned President Hassan Rouhani of Iran in all-capital letters of apocalyptic consequences if his country threatened the United States, increasing tensions to a new level. \u201cBE CAUTIOUS!,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote. Oil prices surged briefly on worries about potential supply disruptions.\nMany analysts of Iranian politics viewed Mr. Trump\u2019s message as part of an intimidation gambit, more than an actual threat. Few said they were predicting a war between Iran and the United States, partly because Iran\u2019s hierarchy is well aware that its forces are vastly outgunned by an American military that would have air and naval dominance. Still, nobody is ruling out an armed clash or another form of Iranian response, like a cyberattack, to send Mr. Trump a defiant message.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think either side wants war,\u201d said Cliff Kupchan, chairman of the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy in Washington. However, Mr. Kupchan said, \u201cthe Iranians are playing with a different fish \u2014 this guy bites \u2014 and that means we\u2019re entering a potentially escalatory phase, and that\u2019s a real risk.\u201d\nHere are answers to some basic questions about the latest face-off between Iran and the United States:\nMr. Trump\u2019s critics say he has surrounded himself with like-minded right-wing ideologues, most notably John R. Bolton, his national security adviser, and Mike Pompeo, his secretary of state, who would like to see regime change in Iran and were happy in May when he scrapped American participation in the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran negotiated by Mr. Trump\u2019s predecessor, Barack Obama.\nSome political analysts say Mr. Trump believes his threats of escalation against Iran may force Iranian leaders to seek negotiations with him to address what he considered fatal flaws in the nuclear deal, in which Iran pledged to never acquire atomic bombs. Mr. Trump has repeatedly congratulated himself for \u2014 in his view \u2014 having successfully executed such a pressure strategy against North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, describing it as critical to Mr. Kim\u2019s decision to halt testing nuclear bombs and missiles and engage with Mr. Trump in a summit meeting last month in Singapore.\nRelations with Iran have been combustible ever since the 1979 Islamic revolution that toppled the American-backed shah. But the basis for the current spike in tensions lay at least in part in the 2016 election of Mr. Trump, who has embraced the position held by Israel and Saudi Arabia, America\u2019s closest Middle East allies, that Iran is an implacable enemy bent on becoming a nuclear-armed state.\nIn repudiating the 2015 nuclear agreement, Mr. Trump has reimposed and intensified nuclear-related economic sanctions on Iran, warning other countries to stop buying Iranian oil, the country\u2019s most important export, or risk economic penalties from the United States. He has included Iran on a list of mostly Muslim countries subject to an American travel ban. He has placed Iran\u2019s central bank governor on a terrorism blacklist. His administration has described Iran\u2019s clerical hierarchy as an irredeemably corrupt kleptocracy, and has cheered Iranians who have protested Iran\u2019s political repressions and increasingly dire economic problems.\nThe American threat to Iran\u2019s oil exports has hit a particular nerve in Iran\u2019s leadership, which has said it may close the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow waterway to the Persian Gulf that accounts for up to 40 percent of oil tanker traffic, if Iran\u2019s oil sales are curtailed.\nOn Sunday, Mr. Rouhani told Iranian diplomats in Tehran that Mr. Trump risked \u201cthe mother of all wars\u201d with Iran and admonished him not to \u201cplay with the lion\u2019s tail,\u201d which may have been the catalyst for the ferocity of Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter response hours later.\nOpinions about American relations with Iran are so polarized it is difficult to speculate. But analysts who have long studied Iran expressed strong doubts that its leaders would capitulate to American pressure.\n\u201cA regime that for 40 years has said \u2018Death to America\u2019 cannot, in the context of President Trump\u2019s aggressive policies, back down,\u201d said Houchang Hassan-Yari, a political-science professor at Queen\u2019s University and Royal Military College in Ontario, Canada. \u201cThey have to stand against the American position.\u201d\nOthers said the Trump administration might be underestimating the tenacity of the Iranian system, which has an extensive apparatus for quelling internal political threats. There is little sign that dissidents in Iran can do more than carry out scattered protests. The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, the paramilitary force that is intensely loyal to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, wields enormous economic and political influence.\nThere is little question that the United States would prevail in a conventional war, an outcome not lost on the Iranians when the United States quickly toppled the Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein and routed the Taliban from power in Afghanistan.\nJust judging by statistics, the conventional United States military dwarfs Iran\u2019s in every way. There are roughly 1.3 million active American military personnel, nearly triple that of Iran. Annual military spending by the United States exceeded $600 billion last year, versus about $16 billion in Iran. The Americans have nearly 6,000  tanks, versus fewer than 1,700 in Iran. The aerial and naval forces of the United States \u2014 more than 13,000 aircraft and nearly 300 battle vessels \u2014 vastly outnumber Iran\u2019s.\nThat does not mean Mr. Trump is ready to back his threats by invading Iran \u2014 such a possibility, on the contrary, is seen as nonexistent. Mr. Trump has said he wants to get the United States out of foreign military entanglements, and Americans have shown little appetite for another war.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see an actual war \u2014 it\u2019s not in anyone\u2019s interest,\u201d said Barbara Slavin, director of the Future of Iran Initiative at the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based research group. \u201cTrump doesn\u2019t even want to keep boots on the ground in Syria.\u201d\nA possible point of conflict is the Strait of Hormuz, where speedboats of the Revolutionary Guards have occasionally harassed American Fifth Fleet warships that patrol the waterway. In an emailed advisory to clients, Mr. Kupchan said, \u201cWar is not imminent, but the probability of an escalatory incident in the Strait of Hormuz is increasing.\u201d\nThe strait has been the backdrop for violent confrontations before. In April 1988, United States naval forces sank three Iranian warships and destroyed two oil platforms after an American frigate was struck by an Iranian mine. Three months later, the American warship Vincennes fired missiles that downed a civilian Iranian jetliner that the Americans say they mistook for a warplane, killing 290 people aboard.\nSome analysts speculated privately that Mr. Trump might be eager to avenge what he saw as an American humiliation in January 2016 \u2014 a few days before the nuclear agreement took effect \u2014 when Revolutionary Guards seized 10 American sailors from two patrol boats and disseminated photos of them in captivity before they were released.\nFor their part, Iranian officials have shown no sign that Mr. Trump\u2019s latest Twitter threat has frightened them. Rather, some have treated it with sarcasm.\nMohammad Javad Zarif, Iran\u2019s American-educated foreign minister and a frequent Twitter user himself, offered this retort on Monday afternoon: \u201cWe\u2019ve been around for millennia & seen fall of empires, incl our own, which lasted more than the life of some countries.
