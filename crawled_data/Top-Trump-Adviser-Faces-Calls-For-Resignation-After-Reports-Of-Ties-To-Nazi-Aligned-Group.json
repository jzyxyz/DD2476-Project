{"title": "Top Trump Adviser Faces Calls For Resignation After Reports Of Ties To Nazi-Aligned Group", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2015 A top counterterrorism adviser to President Donald Trump\u00a0faces growing calls to resign after a series of news reports alleging he has ties to a far-right Hungarian group with historical links to the Nazi party. \nSebastian Gorka was photographed during the January inaugural ball wearing a medal that foreign policy news site LobeLog later identified as a symbol of membership in the Hungarian Order of Heroes. The group, known as Vit\u00e9zi Rend in Hungarian, collaborated with the Nazi government during World War II, according to the State Department. Members of the group are ineligible for American visas. \nGorka did not respond to LobeLog\u2019s request for comment. He later told Breitbart that the medal belonged to his late father, Paul Gorka, who \u201cwas awarded a declaration for his resistance to a dictatorship.\u201d The Forward followed up with a series of reports alleging that Sebastian Gorka spent years immersing himself in far-right, anti-Semitic political organizations in Hungary, and is a sworn member of the Vit\u00e9zi Rend. Gorka ignored requests for comment on the article and instead issued a denial to a friendly reporter at Tablet after The Forward published the allegations. \nThree Democratic senators on Friday called on the acting deputy attorney general and the secretary of homeland security to investigate whether Gorka, who was born in the United Kingdom, \u201cfalsified his naturalization application or otherwise illegally procured his citizenship\u201d by failing to disclose his membership in the banned Hungarian group. The senators cited The Forward\u2019s reporting.\nGorka did not address the documented ties between the Vit\u00e9zi Rend and Nazi Germany in his interviews with Breitbart and Tablet \u2015 and neither outlet brought them up. He has written at length about his father\u2019s suffering under the Nazis during World War II and under the subsequent Communist government in Hungary, but he hasn\u2019t explained how his father came to be a member of a group with Nazi ties.\nPaul Gorka\u2019s Vit\u00e9zi Rend membership is not the only indication that the Gorka family fostered connections to anti-Semitic fringe characters. \nAfter the failed 1956 effort to overthrow the Soviet government in Hungary, Paul Gorka and his soon-to-be-wife Susan fled the country, eventually settling in England, where Sebastian was born in 1970. \nYears later, Susan Gorka crossed paths with David Irving, a British author known for his anti-Semitic revisionist accounts of World War II. Irving gained international notoriety in the 1990s during an unsuccessful libel suit against a historian who had accused him of being a Holocaust denier. But he was already a controversial figure decades before the lawsuit. In 1977, he published a book called Hitler\u2019s War, which asserted that Adolf Hitler was unaware of the Holocaust. \nIrving met Susan Gorka in the 1970s while he was working on a book about the 1956 Hungarian revolution, he told The Huffington Post in an interview. He suspected his interpreter was \u201ctendentiously\u201d translating his interviews, and later concluded the interpreter was a Hungarian spy. He began searching for a new Hungarian speaker who could go through translations of previous interview transcripts to make sure they were correct. Susan Gorka volunteered, he said. \nIn the resulting book Uprising!, Irving asserts that the Hungarian revolution against the communist government was \u201cprimarily an anti-Jewish uprising\u201d \u2015 an assessment disputed by mainstream historians. \n\u201cThe whole conclusion of the book is dead wrong,\u201d Eva Balogh, an emeritus professor of Eastern European history at Yale University, said in an interview. Balogh, who left Hungary after the revolution, was the first to notice Susan Gorka\u2019s work with Irving. \n\u201cI went through that revolution and I remember it pretty well, there was no sign of anti-Semitism as far as I could see it,\u201d Balogh said. \u201cThis is a figment of [Irving\u2019s] imagination and his prejudice.\u201d\nSebastian Gorka did not respond to a detailed list of questions about his mother\u2019s work with Irving, and his own views on Irving\u2019s books. According to Irving, Susan Gorka shared his belief that the 1956 uprising was motivated by antipathy toward Jews. \u201cMost Hungarian exiles do believe that,\u201d he said. \u201cThey regard the uprising as starting as an anti-Jewish program.\u201d \nIn the introduction to Uprising! Irving thanked Susan Gorka as one of four interpreters who made the book possible. He also listed two interviews in London with Paul Gorka in 1974 and 1978 in the section on sourcing. \nIrving said he stayed in touch with Susan Gorka for several years after the book was published in 1981, and met Sebastian Gorka \u201ctwo or three times.\u201d He said he has since lost touch with the family. He had never heard of the Vit\u00e9zi Rend, he said. \nIrving\u2019s past relationship with the family, Balogh said, \u201cshows what kind of milieus the Gorkas lived in.\u201d\nCritics of Trump\u2019s administration say the reports of Gorka\u2019s ties to anti-Semitic groups and individuals reflect a broader problem. \nDuring last year\u2019s presidential campaign, Trump\u2019s nativist immigration policies gained him popularity among neo-Nazi groups. As a candidate, he was slow to disavow an endorsement from former KKK leader David Duke. As president, he delayed before condemning a series of threats against Jewish community centers across the nation. Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro told reporters last month that Trump had suggested the threats could be false flag attacks intended \u201cto make others look bad.\u201d \nThe White House statement on International Holocaust Remembrance Day notably lacked any mention of the Jewish people \u2015 6 million of whom were killed in the Holocaust. Asked to concede that the omission was \u201cquestionable,\u201d Gorka told conservative talk show host Michael Medved the controversy was \u201casinine\u201d and \u201cabsurd.\u201d \nAnd Steve Bannon, Trump\u2019s chief strategist, recently praised the anti-Semitic French philosopher Charles Maurras, who once blamed World War II on Jews. According to his ex-wife, Bannon objected to his kids going to school with \u201cwhiny\u201d Jews. \nIn every instance of alleged anti-Semitism, members of the Trump team have offered some sort of denial, excuse, spin, or misdirection. But connections between Trump administration officials and anti-Semitic fringe characters continue to emerge.\n\u201cThat Sebastian Gorka cannot even deny he has links with a Nazi-affiliated organization is symptomatic of the grotesque Antisemitism that has infected the Trump White House,\u201d the Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect, one of the groups calling for Gorka\u2019s resignation, wrote in a statement. \u201cHow many ducks in the Trump White House must walk, talk and quack Antisemitically before our country wakes up and sees the greater problem?\u201d", "date": "\n03/17/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/sebastian-gorka-vitezi-rend-david-irving_n_58cc5d3ee4b00705db4faa3e", "tags": "anti-semitic faces calls adviser nazi-aligned sebastian gorka reports \u201d trump susan group ties irving hungarian top resignation"}
