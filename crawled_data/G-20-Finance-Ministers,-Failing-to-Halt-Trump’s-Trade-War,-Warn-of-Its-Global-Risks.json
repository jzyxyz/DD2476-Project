{"title": "G-20 Finance Ministers, Failing to Halt Trump\u2019s Trade War, Warn of Its Global Risks", "content": "BUENOS AIRES \u2014 Negotiations to ease an escalating trade war between the United States and the rest of the world sputtered to a close with no breakthroughs on Sunday at a summit meeting of finance ministers, who warned that the predicament over President Trump\u2019s tariffs was casting a pall over the global economy.\nTwo days of fitful talks at the Group of 20 gathering in the Argentine capital appeared only to raise the odds that the friction will intensify as Mr. Trump threatens more tariffs and other countries vow to retaliate. In their closing statement, or communiqu\u00e9, officials at the G-20 on Sunday pointed to trade tensions as a new risk factor that could depress global growth.\n\u201cGrowth has been less synchronized recently and downside risks over the short- and medium-term have increased,\u201d the communiqu\u00e9 said. \u201cThese include rising financial vulnerabilities, heightened trade and geopolitical tensions, global imbalances, inequality and structurally weak growth, particularly in some advanced economies.\u201d\nThe International Monetary Fund projected last week that the currently announced tariffs would reduce global economic output by $430 billion, or half a percent, in 2020, if they remained in place and shook investor confidence. It argued that the United States was particularly vulnerable to a slowdown because it would bear the brunt of tariff retaliation from other countries.\n\u201cI urged once more that trade conflicts be resolved via international cooperation without resort to exceptional measures,\u201d Christine Lagarde, managing director of the fund, said on Sunday, referring to the message that she delivered to policymakers in meetings.\nSteven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said he disagreed with Ms. Lagarde\u2019s assessment of how the United States would fare. The Trump administration has said the tariffs have hurt certain industries in the United States but, at this point, not the broader economy.\nThe United States is engaged in major trade disputes on three fronts: It is attempting to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico; it is engaged in tit-for-tat tariffs with China; and it faces a fierce backlash from the European Union over recently imposed steel and aluminum tariffs and the prospect of new duties on car imports. Mr. Trump has made restructuring trade pacts and reducing America\u2019s trade deficit a central plank of his economic agenda, but his negotiating tactics have angered the country\u2019s allies.\n\u201cWorld trade cannot base itself on the law of the jungle, and the unilateral increase of tariffs is the law of the jungle,\u201d said Bruno Le Maire, the French finance minister. \u201cWe call on the United States to see sense, to respect the rules of multilateralism and to respect their allies.\u201d\nMr. Le Maire said Europe would not negotiate \u201cwith a gun to the head.\u201d\nInternational summit meetings, which once showcased American leadership, have under the Trump administration become awkward affairs in which the United States is increasingly isolated. That remained the case in Argentina, where Mr. Mnuchin traveled on behalf of the United States on a fraught mission of economic diplomacy. Although he said his conversations with other leaders were cordial, he acknowledged that talks on trade were often very \u201cdirect.\u201d\nHis trip came a day after Mr. Trump lashed out at the European Union and China, accusing them of manipulating their currencies to put the United States at an economic disadvantage. The suggestion had raised concern that a currency war could be on the horizon, but the joint statement reaffirmed the group\u2019s exchange rate commitments.\nOlaf Scholz, the German finance minister, rejected Mr. Trump\u2019s accusation, arguing that Europe\u2019s monetary policy is \u201cvery rational\u201d and not geared to create artificial economic success.\nOne of Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s goals before the meeting was to encourage the European Union, Japan and other countries to work with the United States to pressure China to change its trade practices. However, the Treasury secretary said that no progress was made on that front in multicountry meetings, and that aside from pleasantries, he had no communication with the Chinese delegation.\n\u201cAnytime they want to sit down and negotiate meaningful changes, I and our team are available,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said at a concluding news conference on Sunday.\nEurope, which is increasingly anxious that Mr. Trump will impose auto tariffs, is taking Mr. Mnuchin up on such an offer this week. European Union officials, including Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, will travel to Washington for a meeting with Mr. Trump and his economic team in hopes that car tariffs can be avoided.\nThe G-20 meeting also offered the United States an opportunity to jump-start talks with Canada and Mexico about renegotiating Nafta. Mr. Mnuchin and Bill Morneau, Canada\u2019s finance minister, expressed hope that such talks could gather momentum now that the Mexican election is over.\n\u201cMy job is to continue to be optimistic,\u201d Mr. Morneau said, suggesting that he sensed a desire by the United States to preserve the trilateral pact.\nHowever, Mr. Morneau added, the United States\u2019 imposition of tariffs has complicated the process. He warned that tariffs would raise prices on Americans and Canadians and that if Mr. Trump levied another round of them, Canada would have no choice but to retaliate again.\n\u201cThere continues to be anxiety around trade,\u201d he said.\nBesides trade, officials from the countries discussed issues such as cryptocurrencies, international tax and terrorism financing. Although drafting the communiqu\u00e9 has been a struggle in previous meetings, officials said this one was agreed to with relative ease despite the differences on trade and tariffs.\nFor his part, Mr. Mnuchin pushed back against the premise that the United States had become a pariah in international forums. Participating in more than 20 meetings with his counterparts in two days, the Treasury secretary had little down time in Buenos Aires.\n\u201cIf requests for meetings is related to popularity, I\u2019m pretty popular here,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.\nHe added, \u201cI didn\u2019t feel isolated at all.\u201d", "date": "July 22, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/22/us/politics/g-20-summit-tariffs-trade-war.html", "tags": "halt risks ministers united states \u201d trump warn global war failing trade mnuchin tariffs finance"}
