{"title": "U.S. Targets Venezuela With Tough Oil Sanctions During Crisis of Power", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration imposed sanctions against Venezuela\u2019s state-owned oil company on Monday, seeking to cripple the government of embattled President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro by cutting off its main source of cash.\nThe move marked the first punitive step by the United States to force Mr. Maduro to give up power since the opposition leader, Juan Guaid\u00f3, declared himself interim president last week after years of accusations of corruption in Venezuela at the expense of its people.\nThe sanctions prohibit most American businesses from engaging in transactions with the oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, S.A., or Pdvsa. Administration officials said the financial penalties are expected to block $7 billion in assets and result in $11 billion in export losses over the next year for Venezuela\u2019s government, starving it from its most important source of revenue and foreign currency.\nLast week, the Trump administration recognized Mr. Guaid\u00f3, the 35-year-old leader of the National Assembly, as his supporters took to the streets to demand new elections. Mr. Maduro has cut ties to the United States and has demanded that all American diplomats leave the country.\nSteven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said Pdvsa had \u201clong been a vehicle for embezzlement\u201d among top Venezuelan officials and politically connected businessmen.\n\u201cThe United States is holding accountable those responsible for Venezuela\u2019s tragic decline,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said at the White House. He said the Trump administration would pursue all diplomatic and economic avenues to support Mr. Guaid\u00f3 and the National Assembly, \u201cand the Venezuelan people\u2019s efforts to restore their democracy.\u201d\nIn Caracas, the Venezuelan capital, Mr. Maduro immediately denounced the sanctions as \u201cunilateral, illegal, immoral and criminal.\u201d\n\u201cYou will have blood on your hands, President Trump,\u201d Mr. Maduro said during a ceremony honoring Venezuelan diplomats who recently returned home from the United States.\nMr. Maduro said he had ordered Pdvsa to pursue legal action to retain its assets.\nIn an interview Monday before the sanctions were announced, Mr. Guaid\u00f3 said his nascent government was making every effort it could to get control of Venezuela\u2019s international assets \u2014 and mainly the state oil company.\n\u201cThey have the bureaucracy of this country kidnapped, they direct this bureaucracy,\u201d he said, referring to Mr. Maduro and his control of Pdvsa. Mr. Guaid\u00f3 said the National Assembly estimated that $30 billion had gone missing from the oil company in recent years.\n\u201cBecause of this corruption and bad management of public funds, our first step has been to protect the assets of the country,\u201d he said.\nSanctions on Pdvsa potentially put at risk as much as a half-million barrels of oil that the United States imports from Venezuela, representing roughly 3 percent of American demand. The United States also exports roughly 100,000 barrels of light oil to Venezuela daily; it is used for blending so heavy oil can be transported through pipelines to refineries and export terminals.\nPurchases of Venezuelan oil by American companies would be released once Pdvsa is controlled by a government led by Mr. Guaid\u00f3, officials said.\nGenerally, American citizens will be barred from engaging in transactions with the company, although the Treasury Department said it would issue licenses to permit certain transactions and activities within specific time periods.\nMr. Mnuchin said refineries in the United States could continue to process the oil, and Venezuelan oil that is already at sea could continue to its destination. Additionally, he said, the Treasury Department has issued licenses to some European and Caribbean countries so they can make a proper transition as the sanctions take effect.\nPdvsa\u2019s American subsidiary Citgo, which operates three refineries, sends Venezuela gasoline and other refined petroleum products. Under the sanctions, Citgo will be allowed to continue operating, and any money it would send to Pdvsa will go into a designated account, Mr. Mnuchin said.\nIndependent analysts were trying to understand the sanctions and whether there were loopholes.\nRisa Grais-Targow, an analyst of Latin American affairs at Eurasia Group, said it appeared that Pdvsa could no longer export oil to American refineries. That would force the company to sell to Asian markets at a steep discount, she said.\n\u201cIt looks like a de facto embargo because Venezuela will not sell to the U.S. if it cannot collect the revenues,\u201d she said.\nRuss Dallen, the managing partner of Caracas Capital Markets, who specializes in the oil industry, said the United States could put money owed to Pdvsa in an account controlled by the National Assembly.\nBoth Russia and China receive large oil shipments from Venezuela as payments of debt held by the global powers. They do not pay for the oil in cash.\nThat has meant the half-million barrels sent to the United States daily has been a critical source of revenue and foreign currency for Mr. Maduro\u2019s government.\n\u201cU.S. oil exports are where Venezuela gets its cash flow,\u201d Mr. Dallen said.\nAny problems in that cash flow could jeopardize Citgo.\nIn August, an American judge declared that Crystallex, a Canadian gold company whose assets were seized in a 2008 nationalization move by Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, the Venezuelan president at the time, could seize Citgo assets as part of a repayment scheme. In an effort to keep control of the refinery operations, Mr. Maduro\u2019s government has used what little money it still has to pay off part of the $1.4 billion judgment.\nIf Venezuela stops payments, Mr. Maduro could lose control of Citgo, Mr. Dallen said.\nMr. Maduro seemed aware of what was at stake. \u201cWith this measure they\u2019re setting out to steal the Citgo company from all Venezuelans,\u201d he said at the diplomatic ceremony in Caracas. \u201cNo, Donald Trump. No, no, no.\u201d\nFrancisco J. Monaldi, a Venezuelan oil expert at Rice University in Texas, compared the sanctions to a \u201cnuclear bomb.\u201d\nBut he said the moves appeared aimed not at crippling the Venezuelan oil company, but blocking Mr. Maduro\u2019s access to the revenue.\nFor example, the sanctions included exceptions to allow the American oil company Chevron, along with Halliburton and Schlumberger, two large oil services providers, to continue working in Venezuela.\nMr. Mnuchin said he did not expect the sanctions to affect American gas prices. \u201cThere has been excess oil,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of our friends in the Middle East will be happy to make up the supply.\u201d\nThe Trump administration has been urging fellow members of the Organization of American States to recognize Mr. Guaid\u00f3 as Venezuela\u2019s president, and has promised $20 million in food and medical aid to ease economic pain for the country\u2019s citizens. That money would presumably only go to Mr. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s government.\nThe Venezuelan economy has collapsed under the policies by Mr. Maduro\u2019s leftist, authoritarian government, and three million Venezuelans have fled their homeland. Colombia alone has taken in at least one million refugees.\nSenator Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, raised concerns that the oil sanctions could further hurt the Venezuelan people.\n\u201cI strongly back efforts by the United States to use economic and political pressure to support the restoration of democracy in Venezuela,\u201d Mr. Menendez said. \u201cHowever, given the potential implications of this announcement for the well-being of the Venezuelan people, the U.S. should also pair sanctions with expanded efforts to peacefully address Venezuela\u2019s humanitarian crisis.\u201d\nIn a statement, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the sanctions \u201cdo not target the innocent people of Venezuela\u201d and will allow for humanitarian aid to flow. He said medical assistance was \u201cdesperately needed after years of economic destruction under Maduro\u2019s rule.\u201d\nAdministration officials indicated that Mr. Trump was still not ruling out military intervention in his efforts to pressure Mr. Maduro to step down. \u201cThe president has made it very clear on this matter that all options are on the table,\u201d John R. Bolton, the national security adviser, told reporters while clutching a yellow notepad with a cryptic phrase scrawled on top: \u201c5,000 troops to Colombia.\u201d\nSenator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida and a chief proponent of the Trump administration\u2019s hard-line policies on Venezuela, said the oil revenue could be diverted to a government once it is clear that Mr. Maduro cannot get access to the money.\n\u201cThe Maduro crime family has used Pdvsa to buy and keep the support of many military leaders,\u201d Mr. Rubio said in a statement. \u201cThe oil belongs to the Venezuelan people, and therefore the money Pdvsa earns from its export will now be returned to the people through their legitimate constitutional government.\u201d\nIn an interview with The New York Times last Friday, Mr. Rubio said the United States could impose an oil embargo soon to pressure Mr. Maduro to acquiesce to Mr. Guaid\u00f3 and the call for new elections.\n\u201cThat money doesn\u2019t belong to Maduro,\u201d he said. \u201cIt belongs to the legitimate government.\u201d\nOn Monday evening, the new Mexican ambassador to the United States, Martha B\u00e1rcena, reiterated Mexico\u2019s neutral position in a statement. Among Latin American nations, Mexico has been the most notable holdout on recognizing the government of Mr. Guaid\u00f3.\n\u201cWe think a third way of a peaceful solution can be found,\u201d she said. \u201cMexico has offered and is willing to help to find a solution if both parties agree on that. It is up to the Venezuelan people to solve the situation in Venezuela.\u201d", "date": "Jan. 28, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/28/us/politics/venezuela-sanctions-trump-oil.html", "tags": "tough sanctions venezuelan maduro venezuela u.s. states \u201d oil targets power crisis said"}
