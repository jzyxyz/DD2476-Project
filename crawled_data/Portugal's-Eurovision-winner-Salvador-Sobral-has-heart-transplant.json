He is a young man who understood the difficulties of this type of procedure.\"\nMr Abecasis said that before Friday's operation the singer had wished him \"good luck\".\nThe recovery would take a long time, Mr Abecasis added, but said that if all went well, Sobral would have \"a completely normal life\".\nThe singer had to wait several months until a suitable donor was found, Publico reported. He announced in September that he was taking a break from performing.\nSobral's winning ballad, written by his older sister, Luisa, made him a national hero in Portugal.\nHe described it as \"an emotional song with a beautiful lyrical message and harmony - things people are not used to listening these days\".", "date": "9 December 2017", "href": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-42296971", "tags": "transplant song hospital well salvador heart contest abecasis sobral portugal eurovision portuguese winner"}
