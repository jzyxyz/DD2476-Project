{"title": "Hacking the US mid-terms? It's child's play", "content": "Bianca Lewis, 11, has many hobbies. She likes Barbie, video games, fencing, singing\u2026 and hacking the infrastructure behind the world\u2019s most powerful democracy.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to try and change the votes for Donald Trump,\u201d she tells me. \n\u201cI\u2019m going to try to give him less votes. Maybe even delete him off of the whole thing.\u201d \nFortunately for the President, Bianca is attacking a replica website, not the real deal.  \nShe\u2019s taking part in a competition organised by R00tz Asylum, a non-profit organisation that promotes \u201chacking for good\u201d.  \nIts aim is to send out a dire warning: the voting systems that will be used across America for the mid-term vote in November are, in many cases, so insecure a young child can learn to hack them with just a few minute\u2019s coaching. \n\"These are the websites that are very important because they report the election results to the public,\u201d explained Nico Sell, the founder of R00tz Asylum. \n\u201cThey also tell the public where to go to vote. You could imagine if either of these two things were changed, the chaos that would ensue.\u201d \nHacking the real websites would be illegal. So instead, Ms Sell\u2019s team created 13 sites that mimicked the real websites, gaping vulnerabilities and all, for 13 so-called \u201cbattleground\" states - parts of the country where the vote is expected to be tight. \nOver the course of a day, 39 kids aged between 8 and 17 took the challenge - 35 of them succeeded in bypassing the trivial security. Pranks ensued. At one time the site told us 12 billion votes had been cast. Later, we were told that candidate \u201cBob Da Builder\u201d was the victor. \nThe first competitor to break in was 11-year-old Audrey Jones. It took her 10 minutes. \n\u201cThe bugs in the code makes us [able] to do whatever we want,\u201d she tells me.  \n\"We call somebody our own name if we want to, make it look like we won the election!\u201d \nThe contest was part of the kids' zone at Def Con, the annual hacking conference in Las Vegas. This year it was attended by more than 300 eager children, trying everything from lock picking to soldering. At one table I meet two-year-old Catherine Sabonis, happily picking apart a debit card reader. Organisers tell me around half of the attendees are girls. \nThis year is the first time election hacking has been a theme, one which was inspired by similar hacks being carried about by adult attendees at 2017\u2019s show. \nWhile the hacks learnt here wouldn\u2019t change actual vote counts - even if carried out for real - they could alter how the vote results were displayed on official websites. It doesn\u2019t take much imagination to picture the furore that would be caused were an official election website to declare the wrong candidate the winner. \nThe fallibility of these systems has been of concern since 2016\u2019s presidential election, and in some cases well before that. Each state in the US is able to come up with its own system, and with budgets tight, many are relying on poorly secured databases and voting machines that run software that\u2019s well over a decade old. \nLast month, Congress voted along party lines and rejected an amendment put forward by the Democrats. It would have injected $380m into boosting voting security during 2019, renewing a grant of the same amount approved in a previous budget. \nA heated session culminated in supporters of the amendment chanting \u201cUSA! USA!\u201d in the House - but it wasn\u2019t enough to win over Republican votes. \n\u201cWe need to take this threat really seriously,\u201d says Ms Sell. \u201cThe Secretary of State websites should not be this vulnerable. These are known vulnerabilities. It\u2019s something that we as a society need to gather together and fix, because our democracy is at risk.\u201d \nTaking a brief break from hacking, Bianca hands me a sticker with her social media persona on it. I promised I\u2019d give it a plug. I ask her if she\u2019s worried about the lack of security on the websites she\u2019d been attacking, with great success, throughout the day. \n\u201cWe should have it way [more] secure,\u201d she says. \u201cRussians are out there, people.\" \n________\nFollow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC\nDo you have more information about this or any other technology story?
