Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) entered the auditorium at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine to standing applause Friday afternoon as she arrived to tape an hour-long TV special on the Green New Deal, her signature policy proposal, with MSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes. The show is set to air Friday at 8 p.m. Eastern.\u00a0\nOn Tuesday, four members of the Senate\u2019s Democratic caucus joined every Republican in voting to block a resolution staking out what should be in future Green New Deal legislation. On Wednesday, conservatives\u2019 leading voice of reason on climate change published a widely shared essay that offered talking points to oppose the Green New Deal without invoking hamburger bans, Stalinism or genocide. On Thursday night, President Donald Trump smeared the Green New Deal as \u201can extreme, $100 trillion government takeover\u201d at a rally in Michigan, leading the crowd in chants of \u201cAOC sucks.\u201d \nYet here, the audience repeatedly shouted, \u201cWe\u2019ve got your back,\u201d \u201cWe love you\u201d and \u201cS\u00ed, se puede\u201d as Ocasio-Cortez, 29, outlined her plans to dig in for a long-haul fight to enact sweeping reforms that would upend the electrical and automotive sectors, restore the United States to a position of moral leadership and provide millions of Americans union-wage clean energy jobs.\n\u201cThis is not about appealing to my colleagues,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said on stage. \u201cThis is about appealing to you and about appealing to the American people.\u201d\nThe event \u2015 a coup unto itself, getting climate change on cable despite TV producers\u2019 infamous aversion \u2015 cemented Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s place at the helm of the Green New Deal movement and made clear it was just that: a movement far bigger than any mere congressional resolution.\u00a0\nAs her allies are readying primary challenges against Democrats who refuse to join the Green New Deal\u2019s 100 co-sponsors in Congress, Ocasio-Cortez said, \u201cYou don\u2019t necessarily have to replace everybody.\u201d Instead, she\u2019s betting the increasingly visible and deadly effects of climate change will unite a popular base so vast the market fundamentalists in both parties who oppose the kind of New Deal-era, big-government policies needed to match the scope of the climate crisis will fall in line.\n\u201cIf the electorate prioritizes it and overwhelmingly supports it, then we create the political room to pass it,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said.\nIt may be an idealists\u2019 political naivete. But the Green New Deal\u2019s rapid ascent suggests the freshman congresswoman is on to something.\nFor years, positions in the debate over mainstream climate policies ranged from hard-line denial of climate change on one end to moderate market tweaks on the other. Democrats regularly introduced bills to put a price on carbon dioxide emissions through a cap-and-trade scheme or a carbon tax. Tax incentives for renewable energy sources like solar and wind enjoyed bipartisan support, yet so too did subsidies for oil and gas production.\nThen, in October, United Nations scientists forecast average temperatures to increase at least 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit \u2015 a catastrophic spike, likely to cost $54 trillion in damage and countless lives \u2015 unless world governments took unprecedented measures to halve global emissions over the next decade. A month later, a congressionally mandated report by 13 federal agencies confirmed the research. The findings made clear that market fixes alone might have worked in the 1970s, when scientists first understood the climate impacts of burning fossil fuels, but now it\u2019s too late.\n\u201cThe one thing we cannot rebuke and the one thing we cannot deny is climate change is a problem of market failures,\u201d said Ocasio-Cortez, a self-described democratic socialist.\n\u201cExxon Mobil knew that climate change was real and man-made starting as far back as 1970,\u201d she added. \u201cThe entire United States government knew that climate change was real and human-caused in 1989. The initial response was, \u2018Let the market handle it. They will do it.\u2019 Forty years and free-market solutions have not changed our position.\u201d\nInto that void came the Green New Deal. In November, Sunrise Movement, a grassroots group of youth activists, staged protests in then-incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s offices, demanding Democratic leaders fight for sweeping climate policy in the next Congress. Ocasio-Cortez joined the sit-in and became the movement\u2019s champion. \nBefore taking her oath of office, she began gathering support for a resolution to establish a select committee on a Green New Deal. Pelosi ultimately kiboshed the effort. But the campaign popularized the slogan and laid the groundwork for a movement. \nBy December, a survey by Yale and George Mason universities found 81 percent of American voters supported the goals of a Green New Deal, including 64 percent of Republicans and 57 percent of conservative Republicans. Yet the pollsters warned that support would likely wane as the policy became more closely associated with members of one party. \nBy March, the partisan polarization took effect, but the popularity remained. Fifty-two percent of adults supported the Green New Deal, compared to 42 percent who disagreed with it, according to an NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll released this week.\n\u201cIt\u2019s more popular than the Republican tax cuts,\u201d Heather McGhee, a senior fellow at the progressive think tank Demos, said Friday at the town hall. \u201cWe have this idea that left ideas are moving and shaking inside the political atmosphere right now. That\u2019s true. But they\u2019re left in terms of Washington. But in terms of the American people, they\u2019re centrist ideas.\u201d\nThat hasn\u2019t helped tamp down opposition from powerful building trades unions that rely on the pipeline and coal train industries for lucrative jobs. Countering the fossil fuel industry\u2019s appeal to organized labor is an uphill battle for Green New Deal advocates. Very few renewable energy jobs are unionized, and the steady march of right-to-work laws in red states over the past decade makes it difficult to envision a future in which new industries enjoy the same labor precedents as older ones. Ocasio-Cortez said that was one reason the Green New Deal movement could not abandon its class politics to secure support from avowedly pro-business conservatives.\u00a0\n\u201cWe cannot allow for the fossil fuel jobs to be better, more dignified and higher-waged with stronger labor support behind [them] than new energy jobs,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I\u2019m tired of is us worrying more about the future of fossil fuels than worry about the future of fossil fuel workers.\u201d\u00a0\nEven as Republicans vilified the Green New Deal with increasingly absurd rhetoric \u2015 including displaying an image on the Senate floor of former President Ronald Reagan riding a velociraptor \u2015 the party has struggled to articulate an alternative vision. Those that have emerged suggest the Green New Deal has dramatically shifted the center of the climate debate leftward. \nOn Monday, Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) cribbed the Green New Deal\u2019s rhetoric harkening to a World War II-level mobilization effort when he proposed a New Manhattan Project for Clean Energy that he said would \u201cdouble federal funding for energy research\u201d and implement a five-year plan to \u201ccreate new sources of cheap, clean energy.\u201d That same week, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a loyal Trump ally, drafted a nonbinding resolution staking out a \u201cGreen Real Deal\u201d that would acknowledge the threat climate change poses to \u201chuman health and safety\u201d in \u201ccommunities across the United States.\u201d\n\u201cA decade of disputation [is] followed now by this incredible uptick of Republicans looking around for solutions,\u201d former Rep. Bob Inglis (R-S.C.), whose support for climate action led to his ouster in a primary challenge in 2010, said at the event, where he was the lone Republican official. \u201cWe\u2019ve now seen the whites of its eyes. It\u2019s here now, so it\u2019s hard to deny.\u201d\nStill, he compared the rise of Ocasio-Cortez of her fellow left-wing Democrats to that of the tea party, the far-right Republican wing that surged to power during the Obama administration and organized Trump\u2019s base of anti-immigrant, climate change-denying hard-liners. \n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing the formation of the tea party of the left,\u201d he said, comparing the audience here to that at Trump\u2019s rally in Michigan. \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between last night and tonight? This is the mirror image. This is the flip side.\u201d \nThe remark drew fervent boos and calls to \u201cget off the stage.\u201d \n\u201cMake the changes now, you moron,\u201d one man shouted as Inglis called for incremental tweaks.\n\u201cHey, hey, that\u2019s unacceptable,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez scorned, addressing the heckler. The crowd applauded. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the difference between me and Trump.\u201d \u00a0\nShe said she understood \u201cwhy people say \u2018the tea party of the left,\u2019\u201d noting that her campaign ousted former Rep. Joe Crowley (D-N.Y.), the fourth-most powerful Democrat in Congress and possible House speaker who had deep ties to corporate interests. \n\u201cThis is not the tea party of the left, this is a return to American representative democracy,\u201d she said. \u201cThe big difference? The Koch brothers funded the tea party. Everyday people funded my campaign.\u201d\nThis story has been updated with Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s comments about fossil fuel jobs and workers.", "date": "\n03/29/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-green-new-deal_n_5c9ea7e2e4b0bc0daca8c489", "tags": "congress alexandria \u201d ocasio-cortez climate promises refuse change \u2015 new defiantly deal green"}
