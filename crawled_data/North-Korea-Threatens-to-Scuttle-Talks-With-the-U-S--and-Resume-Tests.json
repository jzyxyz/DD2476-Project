{"title": "North Korea Threatens to Scuttle Talks With the U.S. and Resume Tests", "content": "North Korea threatened on Friday to suspend negotiations with the Trump administration over the North\u2019s nuclear arms program and said its leader, Kim Jong-un, would soon decide whether to resume nuclear and missile tests.\nAddressing diplomats and foreign correspondents at a news conference in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui said that personal relations between Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump were \u201cstill good and the chemistry is mysteriously wonderful.\u201d\nBut she said that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and John Bolton, Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, had created an \u201catmosphere of hostility and mistrust\u201d that thwarted the top leaders\u2019 negotiations in Hanoi, Vietnam, last month.\nAfter the Hanoi meeting ended without a deal, the North Korean leader had serious doubts about the merits of continuing negotiations with Mr. Trump, Ms. Choe said.\n\u201cWe have neither the intention to compromise with the U.S. in any form nor much less the desire or plan to conduct this kind of negotiation,\u201d said Ms. Choe, according a report from Pyongyang by The Associated Press, which has a bureau there.\nShe also said the North might end its self-imposed moratorium on tests of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles.\n\u201cWhether to maintain this moratorium or not is the decision of our chairman of the state affairs commission,\u201d she said, referring to Mr. Kim by one of his several leadership titles. \u201cHe will make his decision in a short period of time.\u201d\nIn a briefing with reporters on Friday, Mr. Pompeo sought to lower any tensions related to Ms. Choe\u2019s comments, framing them as nothing more than rhetorical speed bumps that tend to follow both summit meetings.\nTo make the point, he noted that he had been assigned a \u201cgangsterlike\u201d reputation by the North Koreans, but the name-calling had done nothing to hinder negotiations.\n\u201cI saw the remark that she made,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said of Ms. Choe. \u201cWe are hopeful that we can continue to have conversations and negotiations.\u201d\nMr. Pompeo added that Mr. Kim had made multiple promises during the Hanoi summit meeting to Mr. Trump that he would take steps to wind down his nuclear program. Despite the unpredictable messaging, he said, the administration would continue to take Mr. Kim at his word.\nMr. Bolton, for his part, told reporters at the White House that any suggestion that he and Mr. Pompeo undermined the negotiations were inaccurate, and that he had been in touch with national security officials in South Korea about the remarks.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve discussed their reaction and our reaction,\u201d Mr. Bolton said. \u201cI\u2019d like to speak further within the U.S. government before we respond.\u201d\nThe office of South Korea\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in, who did much to broker the talks between the North and the United States, said it was closely monitoring the situation. \u201cWhatever the situation, our government will try its best to help resume North Korea-U.S. negotiations,\u201d it said in a statement.\nThe breakdown of the Hanoi meeting revealed a wide gap between North Korea and the United States over how to proceed with denuclearization.\nNorth Korea insisted, as it has before, on moving in phases. In Hanoi, Mr. Kim offered to dismantle the plutonium, uranium-enrichment and other facilities at its Yongbyon site, north of Pyongyang, and demanded that Washington in return lift crucial sanctions that have been imposed on the North since 2016.\nMr. Trump rejected the offer, demanding more substantial steps toward denuclearization. North Korea is widely believed to run at least one other uranium-enrichment plant outside Yongbyon, as well as keeping other elements of its nuclear program in secret locations around the mountainous country.\nAmerican officials have said that North Korea asked the United States at the Hanoi talks to lift five rounds of sanctions that have been imposed since 2016. But North Korean officials, including Ms. Choe on Friday, have insisted that they demanded that only those sanctions that affected their country\u2019s civilian economy be lifted.\nUnited States officials are concerned that pulling back from major sanctions would diminish their leverage over North Korea and that the North would use any new revenues to subsidize its nuclear weapons program. United Nations sanctions imposed since 2016 have been the most punishing, banning all the North\u2019s key exports, including coal, and drastically cutting back its fuel imports.\nMr. Kim took a 65-hour train ride to meet Mr. Trump in Hanoi, and it was seen as a major embarrassment for him to return home without badly needed sanctions relief.\nBy avoiding direct criticism of Mr. Trump and blaming the Hanoi talks\u2019 breakdown mainly on his aides, Ms. Choe appeared to signal that North Korea still hoped Mr. Trump might soften Washington\u2019s position.\nBut since the Hanoi talks, analysts have feared that North Korea might resume weapons tests in a bid to gain more leverage, and Ms. Choe\u2019s warnings on Friday could be a sign that North Korea is preparing to move in that direction.\n\u201cOn our way back to the homeland, our chairman of the state affairs commission said, \u2018For what reason do we have to make this train trip again?\u2019\u201d Ms. Choe said on Friday, according to The A.P. \u201cI want to make it clear that the gangsterlike stand of the U.S. will eventually put the situation in danger.\u201d\nShe said the United States had thrown away \u201ca golden opportunity\u201d in Hanoi, adding that the North was no longer interested in negotiating unless Washington changed its \u201cpolitical calculation.\u201d\nNorth Korea declared a moratorium on its nuclear and long-range missile tests after flight-testing its Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missile in November 2017. A resumption of tests could scuttle the rapprochement between North Korea and the United States that began last year, after a series of belligerent threats from both sides during Mr. Trump\u2019s first year in office.\nMr. Trump has said that he and Mr. Kim \u201cfell in love\u201d at their first meeting in Singapore last June, and he has cited the North\u2019s testing moratorium as one of his major diplomatic achievements. The Singapore meeting produced a vague agreement to transform bilateral relations, build peace and \u201cwork toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\u201d\nMr. Trump has said he would be \u201cvery disappointed\u201d if the North resumed weapons tests.\nAfter the breakdown of the Hanoi talks, satellite-image analysts concluded that North Korea had been rebuilding a partially dismantled structure at its Tongchang-ri satellite-launching site, which the country has used to test and develop engines and other technologies for its long-range missiles.\nNorth Korea tested what it said was a hydrogen bomb in September 2017. It also tested three long-range missiles in 2017. But outside missile experts say the North may need more tests to acquire all the technologies needed to build a reliable intercontinental ballistic missile.", "date": "March 15, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/world/asia/north-korea-kim-jong-un-nuclear.html", "tags": "hanoi resume threatens u.s. \u201d scuttle tests choe kim north korea said talks"}
