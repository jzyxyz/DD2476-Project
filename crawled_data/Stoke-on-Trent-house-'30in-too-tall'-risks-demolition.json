They sold their other house to fund the new one.\"\nThe family's representative said demolition would be \"excessive\" and \"draconian\", leaving the planning committee divided.\nVice-chairman Andy Platt said it was \"wrong\" that the house had been built too tall, but to knock it down would be \"a little over the top\".\nHowever councillor Janine Bridges said it would \"set a precedent\" for developers to \"build what they like\" and ask permission later.\nYou may also be interested in:\nNeighbour Robert Wakefield said local reaction to the \"enormous\" house had been \"mixed\", but it was a \"fair and just judgement\" to refuse planning permission.\nMr Naseem \"should have thought about this before he started\", Mr Wakefield said.\nThe family has been given three months to allow for talks to continue.", "date": "10 May 2018", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-stoke-staffordshire-44068562", "tags": "council planning risks house roof demolition naseem tall new stoke-on-trent family"}
