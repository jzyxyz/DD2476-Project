Used spray-paint cans lay in heaps amid the weeds of an abandoned lot. Street art covered the walls of an empty warehouse; inside, teenagers rumbled around on skateboards.\nWorld-class culinary destination? The site, right outside the ragged border of this city\u2019s freewheeling Christiania neighborhood, seemed more like the Four Seasons after an apocalypse.\nBut Mr. Redzepi envisioned something else as he climbed a staircase to a tar-papered roof and gazed out at a lake on the edge of the property. In what qualifies as a wildly risky roll of the dice, he plans to close Noma after a final service on New Year\u2019s Eve in 2016. He hopes to reopen for business in 2017 with a new menu and a new mission.\nAs a crucial part of that, he wants to transform this decrepit patch of land into a state-of-the-art urban farm, with Noma at its center.\n\u201cIt makes sense to do it here,\u201d he said, despite visual evidence to the contrary. \u201cIt makes sense to have your own farm, as a restaurant of this caliber.\u201d His plans are nothing if not ambitious. He will put a greenhouse on the roof. He will dig out the dank old asphalt lot and truck in fresh soil. He wants part of the farm to float.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll build a raft, and we\u2019ll put a huge field on the raft,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need a full-time farmer with a team.\u201d\nIf the concept carries a slight echo of that dream of building an opera house in Werner Herzog\u2019s film \u201cFitzcarraldo,\u201d Mr. Redzepi is fully aware of the gamble. \u201cIt really, really, really, really makes me nervous,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid. But it does make me nervous.\u201d\nDan Barber, a New York chef who has dug deep into farming, said one big challenge for Mr. Redzepi could come from the unpredictability of agriculture. \u201cDoes that carry risks with it? Sure,\u201d Mr. Barber said.\nWhen a restaurant has its own farm, as Mr. Barber does at Blue Hill at Stone Barns in the Lower Hudson Valley, it can signify a chef\u2019s desire for \u201cthe ultimate control\u201d of ingredients, he said, but \u201cobviously the best kind of farming is the lack of control,\u201d and cooks have to learn to work with whatever the earth produces.\n\u201cI continue to be in awe of the guy,\u201d he said of Mr. Redzepi. \u201cIt takes a leader in the field to change the culture.\u201d\nThe changes at Noma are not driven by necessity. There has not been a rent increase at the original location; business remains brisk. Mr. Redzepi simply believes that the restaurant, where he has led the kitchen for 12 years, is ready for a drastic evolution.\nIn his mind, Noma hasn\u2019t even crawled out of its infancy. \u201cWe\u2019re just finding our way,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though it has been successful, even though it has had media attention and all that.\u201d Lately, he has been asking himself broad existential questions about what it means to be a local restaurant in the Nordic region. \u201cWhat are we?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd how do we progress?\u201d\nTo illustrate all this as he showed off the property, he grabbed a pebble and scratched out the number 12 in the dirt. Then he added a zero, conveying the notion that Noma could last for a century or more. \u201cWe should make decisions that make this evolution last for 912 years,\u201d he said.\nAs for the next two years, he\u2019s already committed to giving the menu a radical shake-up. Over time, he has become less and less sure that it makes sense for customers to pass through the traditional stages of a tasting menu, from small nibbles to a slab of meat, culminating in sweets and coffee. \u201cWe\u2019ve allowed the format of a tasting menu to dictate what we cook,\u201d he said.\nHe intends to replace that predictable progression with a more fervent adherence to seasonality. In the fall, then, Noma\u2019s menu will focus only on wild game (from goose to moose) and foraged autumnal ingredients like mushrooms and forest berries. In the winter, when \u201cthe waters are ice-cold and some of the fish have bellies full of roe,\u201d as he put it, Noma will mutate into a seafood restaurant.\nSpring and summer? \u201cThe world turns green,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so will the menu.\u201d In an expectation-thwarting move, during those months Noma will become a fully vegetarian restaurant, with much of the bounty ostensibly coming from the farm he wants to conjure up.\n\u201cIt\u2019s huge,\u201d he said. \u201cHow are you going to give a bowl of spinach the same pleasure that a steak gives? A richness of flavor: That is something that we will deal with.\u201d (Even the tableware will shift with each season.)\nMr. Redzepi, who seems to crave change the way most people crave that steak, said the transplanting is only one of the shifts he has in store for the months ahead.\nFrom late December to the middle of next April, the restaurant staff will be relocating to Sydney, Australia, to see what happens when the Noma approach is applied to Australian ingredients. (It undertook a similar experiment in Japan this year, and the Japanese reverence for the seasons clearly had a deep influence on Mr. Redzepi\u2019s thinking. \u201cIt\u2019s as if everything they eat is at the right moment,\u201d he said.)\nFor the first time in his career, Mr. Redzepi is forming a partnership to open a second restaurant, a more casual enterprise in Copenhagen with the chef Kristian Baumann heading the kitchen, and he has lured the Irish chef Trevor Moran to leave the Catbird Seat in Nashville and come back to Noma (where he worked for four years) to help lead the next wave.\nEvidence suggests that Mr. Redzepi\u2019s employees are accustomed to hearing their captain ordering them to steer for the high seas. Every week at Noma, after the final high-pressure dinner service, they gather in the kitchen for Saturday Night Projects, a public and semi-gladiatorial face-off at which young cooks are asked to put together their own dishes for Mr. Redzepi\u2019s inspection and analysis. He even broadcasts it via Periscope.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like the Google of restaurants,\u201d said Malcolm Livingston II, who moved from New York last year to become Noma\u2019s pastry chef. \u201cThat\u2019s what keeps it exciting: It stays fresh.\u201d\nOver the years, Noma has pioneered approaches to fermentation, foraging, aging and even cooking with insects. \u201cYou\u2019re taking risks every time you move forward,\u201d said the head chef, Daniel Giusti, who grew up in New Jersey. But a big leap into agriculture could be the riskiest move of all.\n\u201cThat\u2019s where the challenge will come in,\u201d Mr. Giusti said. \u201cAre we growing the right stuff? Is it good? I know Ren\u00e9. It\u2019s going to have to be great.\u201d\nTechnically, Noma\u2019s new home lies in the center of the city, even though it feels like some faraway vegetation-tangled edge. Mr. Redzepi may be seeking wilder pastures at the right time. A new walkable bridge will soon connect Nyhavn, one of the most tourist-packed parts of Copenhagen, to the docklike zone that currently houses Noma and its fermentation lab. As often happens in New York City, gentrification is surging in. Change is in the air.\n\u201cOf course we could just keep continuing, just stay put and do what we do there,\u201d Mr. Redzepi said. \u201cBut I genuinely think that we won\u2019t progress.\u201d He seemed rapt as he stood among the weeds and broken glass, as if admiring the new Noma in its finished state. \u201cI have yet to meet anyone who thinks this is a stupid thing,\u201d he said.\nHe pondered this observation for a second or two. Then he got antsy, as he often does. \u201cI can\u2019t stand still like this,\u201d he said.", "date": "Sept. 14, 2015", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/16/dining/noma-rene-redzepi-urban-farm.html", "tags": "urban farm ren\u00e9 chef even close noma reopen \u201d restaurant plans new redzepi"}
