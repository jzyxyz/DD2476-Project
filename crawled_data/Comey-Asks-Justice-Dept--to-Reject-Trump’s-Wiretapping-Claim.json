{"title": "Comey Asks Justice Dept. to Reject Trump\u2019s Wiretapping Claim", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, asked the Justice Department this weekend to publicly reject President Trump\u2019s assertion that President Barack Obama ordered the tapping of Mr. Trump\u2019s phones, senior American officials said on Sunday. Mr. Comey has argued that the highly charged claim is false and must be corrected, they said, but the department has not released any such statement.\nMr. Comey, who made the request on Saturday after Mr. Trump leveled his  allegation on Twitter, has been working to get the Justice Department to knock down the claim because it falsely insinuates that the F.B.I. broke the law, the officials said.\nA spokesman for the F.B.I. declined to comment. Sarah Isgur Flores, the spokeswoman for the Justice Department, also declined to comment.\nMr. Comey\u2019s request is a remarkable rebuke of a sitting president, putting the nation\u2019s top law enforcement official in the position of questioning Mr. Trump\u2019s truthfulness. The confrontation between the two is the most serious consequence of Mr. Trump\u2019s weekend Twitter outburst, and it underscores the dangers of what the president and his aides have unleashed by accusing the former president of a conspiracy to undermine Mr. Trump\u2019s young administration.\nThe White House showed no indication that it would back down from Mr. Trump\u2019s claims. On Sunday, the president demanded a congressional inquiry into whether Mr. Obama had abused the power of federal law enforcement agencies before the 2016 presidential election. In a statement from his spokesman, Mr. Trump called \u201creports\u201d about the wiretapping \u201cvery troubling\u201d and said Congress should examine them as part of its investigations into Russia\u2019s meddling in the election.\nIn addition to being concerned about potential attacks on the bureau\u2019s credibility, senior F.B.I. officials are said to be worried that the notion of a court-approved wiretap will raise the public\u2019s expectations that the federal authorities have significant evidence implicating the Trump campaign in colluding with Russia\u2019s efforts to disrupt the presidential election.\nMr. Comey has not been dealing directly with Attorney General Jeff Sessions on the matter, as Mr. Sessions announced on Thursday that he would recuse himself from any investigation of Russia\u2019s efforts to influence the election. It had been revealed on Wednesday that Mr. Sessions had misled Congress about his meetings with the Russian ambassador during the campaign.\nMr. Comey\u2019s behind-the-scenes maneuvering is certain to invite contrasts to his actions last year, when he spoke publicly about the Hillary Clinton email case and disregarded Justice Department entreaties not to.\nIt is not clear why Mr. Comey did not issue a statement himself. He is the most senior law enforcement official who was kept on the job as the Obama administration gave way to the Trump administration. And while the Justice Department applies for intelligence-gathering warrants, the F.B.I. keeps its own records and is in a position to know whether Mr. Trump\u2019s claims are true. While intelligence officials do not normally discuss the existence or nonexistence of surveillance warrants, no law prevents Mr. Comey from issuing the statement.\nIn his demand for a congressional inquiry, the president, through his press secretary, Sean Spicer, issued a statement on Sunday that said, \u201cPresident Donald J. Trump is requesting that as part of their investigation into Russian activity, the congressional intelligence committees exercise their oversight authority to determine whether executive branch investigative powers were abused in 2016.\u201d\nMr. Spicer, who repeated the entire statement in a series of Twitter posts, added that \u201cneither the White House nor the president will comment further until such oversight is conducted.\u201d\nA spokesman for Mr. Obama and his former aides have called the accusation by Mr. Trump completely false, saying that Mr. Obama never ordered any wiretapping of a United States citizen.\n\u201cA cardinal rule of the Obama administration was that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice,\u201d Kevin Lewis, Mr. Obama\u2019s spokesman, said in a statement on Saturday.\nMr. Trump\u2019s demand for a congressional investigation appears to be based, at least in part, on unproven claims by Breitbart News and conservative talk radio hosts that secret warrants were issued authorizing the tapping of the phones of Mr. Trump and his aides at Trump Tower in New York.\nIn a series of Twitter posts on Saturday, the president seemed to be convinced that those claims were true. In one post, Mr. Trump said, \u201cI\u2019d bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election!\u201d\nOn Sunday, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the deputy White House press secretary, said the president was determined to find out what had really happened, calling it potentially the \u201cgreatest abuse of power\u201d that the country had seen.\n\u201cLook, I think he\u2019s going off of information that he\u2019s seen that has led him to believe that this is a very real potential,\u201d Ms. Sanders said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cAnd if it is, this is the greatest overreach and the greatest abuse of power that I think we have ever seen and a huge attack on democracy itself. And the American people have a right to know if this took place.\u201d\nThe claims about wiretapping appear similar in some ways to the unfounded voter fraud charges that Mr. Trump made during his first days in the Oval Office. Just after Inauguration Day, he reiterated in a series of Twitter posts his belief that millions of voters had cast ballots illegally \u2014 claims that also appeared to be based on conspiracy theories from right-wing websites.\nAs with his demand for a wiretapping inquiry, Mr. Trump called for a \u201cmajor investigation\u201d into voter fraud, saying on Twitter that \u201cdepending on results, we will strengthen up voting procedures!\u201d No investigation has been started.\nSenior law enforcement and intelligence officials who worked in the Obama administration have said that there were no secret intelligence warrants regarding Mr. Trump. Asked whether such a warrant existed, James R. Clapper Jr., a former director of national intelligence, said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d \u201cNot to my knowledge, no.\u201d\n\u201cThere was no such wiretap activity mounted against the president-elect at the time, as a candidate or against his campaign,\u201d Mr. Clapper added.\nMr. Trump\u2019s demands for a congressional investigation were initially met with skepticism by lawmakers, including Republicans. Appearing on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday, Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said he was \u201cnot sure what it is that he is talking about.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure what the genesis of that statement was,\u201d Mr. Rubio said.\nPressed to elaborate on \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Mr. Rubio said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to be a part of a witch hunt, but I\u2019m also not going to be a part of a cover-up.\u201d", "date": "March 5, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/05/us/politics/trump-seeks-inquiry-into-allegations-that-obama-tapped-his-phones.html", "tags": "comey wiretapping president department claim justice trump dept \u201d asks obama statement reject"}
