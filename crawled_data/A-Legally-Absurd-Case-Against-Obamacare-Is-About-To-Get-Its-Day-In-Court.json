{"title": "A Legally Absurd Case Against Obamacare Is About To Get Its Day In Court", "content": "Attorneys representing 20 Republican state officials on Wednesday will walk into court and ask a federal district judge to invalidate\u00a0the Affordable Care Act \u2015 a move that could unleash chaos on insurance markets and, eventually, leave an estimated 17 million\u00a0Americans without coverage.\nIt\u2019s an outlandish request that relies on what even the law\u2019s longtime critics are calling an outlandish argument. Jonathan Adler, the Case Western law professor who was an architect of the last big lawsuit challenging the Affordable Care Act\u2019s constitutionality, says the case\u2019s theory is \u201cunmoored\u201d and \u201cabsurd.\u201d Lamar Alexander, the Tennessee Republican and chairman of the Senate\u2019s health committee, has called it \u201cfar-fetched.\u201d\nBut while the case seems unlikely to prevail, defenders of the law and advocates for the people who depend on it aren\u2019t ready to dismiss the threat out of hand. And it\u2019s easy to see why, given not just the stakes but also the circumstances of Wednesday\u2019s hearing.\nThe plaintiffs filed their suit in U.S. District Court in Fort Worth, Texas, where they knew they would get a conservative jurist \u2015 and where they drew Reed O\u2019Connor, a George W. Bush nominee. \nThe last time an issue related to the Affordable Care Act landed in O\u2019Connor\u2019s courtroom was in 2016, when he blocked Obama administration regulations that would have prohibited health care providers from refusing to treat transgender patients for religious reasons. That ruling probably had more to do with his feelings about religious freedom and LGBTQ rights than the Affordable Care Act, but nobody walked away thinking he was a fan of the law, the people who wrote it or the ideas behind it.\nMeanwhile, the Texas case has already taken one unexpected, but critical, turn.\u00a0In June, the Trump administration\u2019s lawyers at the Justice Department filed a brief supporting the lawsuit. Customarily, Justice Department lawyers defend federal statutes, even ones that the administration in power doesn\u2019t like, in order to meet the president\u2019s constitutional obligation that \u201cthe laws be faithfully executed.\u201d\nSeveral career attorneys at Justice refused to put their name on the administration\u2019s brief, and one longtime lawyer left the department immediately afterward, which suggests the decision to side with the plaintiffs didn\u2019t sit well with them \u2015 that they concluded the administration\u2019s action on this case was more about politics than law, and just another salvo in President Donald Trump\u2019s ongoing war against \u201cObamacare.\u201d\nThe Affordable Care Act will still get a robust defense on Wednesday. It will come from a team of lawyers led by\u00a0Xavier Becerra, attorney general of California, and 16 other state Democratic officials who stepped in when the Trump administration wouldn\u2019t. When the time comes, they will square off with the GOP\u2019s lawyers over some familiar subjects: pre-existing conditions and the individual mandate.\nThe Affordable Care Act prohibited insurers from declining coverage or charging higher premiums to people who already had medical problems or were at high risk of developing them. The law also introduced the mandate, which slaps a financial penalty on people who don\u2019t get coverage, giving healthy people more incentive to enroll \u2015 and, in the process, making it easier for insurers to hold down premiums.\nLast year Republicans decided to reduce the penalty to zero, effective in 2019, as part of the tax cut that Trump eventually signed. That change is the impetus for the lawsuit. When the Supreme Court upheld the mandate in a 2012 lawsuit, it did so on the theory that the mandate was a tax \u2015 logic that no longer applies, the plaintiffs say, if there\u2019s no financial penalty. And if the mandate is unconstitutional, the plaintiffs say, then the rest of the law is,\u00a0too, because Congress intended for the mandate and the rest of Obamacare to work in tandem.\nThere\u2019s a lot going on in that line of reasoning, some sensical and some not-so-sensical, but the heart of the argument these Republican officials are making is about what is known as \u201cseverability\u201d \u2015 the question of when courts can eliminate just one piece of the law, thus \u201csevering\u201d it from the statute, while leaving the rest in place. Although experts argue over exactly how to answer that question, they all agree that the purpose of severability is to respect the will of Congress.\nAnd that is where the lawsuit ought to fall apart, in the opinion of virtually every expert who has spoken out on the case, because Congress made its intentions clear a year ago when it passed that tax cut. At that time, lawmakers understood that the rest of the law would stay in place even if they removed the penalty.\u00a0They voted yes anyway. \n\u201cWhat matters is the intent of the Congress who did the legislative act in question \u2015 setting the penalty to zero,\u201d Abbe Gluck, a professor at Yale Law School, told HuffPost. \u201cThat Congress was the 2017 Congress, and that Congress clearly concluded the rest of the statute could stand without the mandate.\u201d\nSome of the people who were smack in the middle of the 2017 debate can vouch for that account. Among them is\u00a0Alexander, who is a key player in the party\u2019s health policy decision-making. \u201cCongress specifically repealed the individual mandate penalty,\u201d Alexander said in June, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t hear a single senator say that they also thought they were repealing protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\u201d\nAnd the record backs up his recollection. During the debate over the tax cut, when lawmakers were talking about the effects of reducing the mandate penalty to zero, Pat Toomey, the GOP senator from Pennsylvania, went out of his way to say that Republicans were only taking away the penalty. \u201cWe don\u2019t change the rules,\u201d he said.\nThat kind of evidence ought to clinch the case for the defense, if it were ever in doubt, although it\u2019s impossible to know how Judge O\u2019Connor will see things.\u00a0Wednesday\u2019s hearing is for a preliminary injunction, with the plaintiffs asking him to block the federal government from enforcing the law until the lawsuit gets a full hearing. O\u2019Connor could grant that injunction, applying it to the entire country or just the 20 states where officials signed on to the case. Or he could issue a full judgment on the merits of the lawsuit. \nIn filing its brief supporting the lawsuit, the Trump administration conspicuously stopped short of calling on the courts to throw out the entire law, instead seeking invalidation of only those insurance regulations \u2015 like the guarantee of coverage for people with pre-existing conditions \u2015 that interact with the mandate. \nOne worry is that\u00a0O\u2019Connor could see that option as a way to strike against the law while still appearing to stop short of what the 20 state officials filing the lawsuit want. \u201cThe D.O.J. position is incredibly dangerous,\u201d Gluck said. \u201cIt tries to split the baby and ask for only part of the statute to be struck down with the mandate \u2026 it offers the judge a kind of compromise way out.\u201d\nThe effects of even such a partial ruling would still be far-reaching, as health care organizations and experts who filed friend-of-the-court briefs attested. Insurers selling policies directly to individuals would face an entirely different legal environment and have to redesign their products. People with conditions such as diabetes, cancer and HIV who try to buy coverage on their own would lose their guarantees of access. Even people with employer-sponsored insurance could lose some of the protections that the law gives them.\nOf course, O\u2019Connor is still just a district judge. Becerra and the Democratic state officials would appeal any adverse decision immediately, seeking a stay \u2015 and they would probably get one, if not from O\u2019Connor, then from the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, where they would once again stand a good chance of prevailing on the merits.\nBut even if O\u2019Connor\u2019s ruling did not take immediate effect, it could still have repercussions. The Trump administration has repeatedly tried to undermine the workings of the law and might use a favorable ruling from O\u2019Connor as an excuse to do more. \nThe administration would do so at its own political peril, though, especially with the midterm elections just two months away. As it is, most Republicans running for Congress are trying desperately to distance themselves from the lawsuit or at least to profess their commitment to protecting people with pre-existing conditions.\nMost likely that is because they can read polls, like one that the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation published early Wednesday. In that survey, 75 percent of all respondents \u2015 and 58 percent of Republicans \u2015 said preserving the Affordable Care Act\u2019s protections were \u201cvery important.\u201d\nBut if recent history has proved anything, it\u2019s that Trump is unpredictable and often uninterested in, or at least ignorant of, his own political self-interest. It\u2019s just one more reason the people following this case closely are more confident about the merits of their argument than whether that argument will carry the day.", "date": "\n09/05/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/obamacare-lawsuit-preexisting-conditions-mandate_n_5b8ef9fbe4b0511db3dd1045", "tags": "lawsuit care mandate legally obamacare court absurd get \u201d \u2015 case law day"}
