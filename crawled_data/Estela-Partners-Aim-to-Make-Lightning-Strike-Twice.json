{"title": "Estela Partners Aim to Make Lightning Strike Twice", "content": "More than two years after it opened in a semi-clandestine nook above Houston Street, Estela is widely regarded as one of those restaurants that embody what it means to eat out in New York City at the moment. And this fall, the two principal forces behind it, the chef Ignacio Mattos and the manager and wine maven Thomas Carter, will try to duplicate that success with Caf\u00e9 Altro Paradiso, an Italian restaurant they intend to bring to Spring Street in SoHo.\nBut as the two look forward, it can be amusing (and instructive) for them to look back, because the early days of Estela did not feel so promising.\nBoth had recently left security behind: Mr. Mattos, now 36, had been asked to pack up his knives at Isa, in Brooklyn, while in Westchester County, N.Y., at the bucolic agri-utopia of Blue Hill at Stone Barns in Pocantico Hills, the chef Dan Barber and Mr. Carter, 39, had decided that Mr. Carter was losing his focus and that it was time for him to move on after six years as beverage director.\nIn what sounds like the premise for a \u201cMidnight Run\u201d-style buddy comedy, the two men were introduced to each other by a well-known truffle peddler, John Magazino, and trusted their guts that it made sense to team up after they\u2019d had a single lunch together at Lupa.\n\u201cI think it was a pretty weird pairing, at the start,\u201d Mr. Carter said. They quickly discovered that they didn\u2019t always see eye to eye. They still don\u2019t.\n\u201cOne of the first arguments we had was over a glass of wine,\u201d recalled Mr. Mattos, who thought it would be cool to serve wine in tumblers. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018Over my dead body,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Carter said.\nMr. Carter wasn\u2019t exactly thrilled with Mr. Mattos\u2019s cooking. \u201cI hated Isa,\u201d he said, before rephrasing. \u201cI wasn\u2019t into it.\u201d He remembers having a bite of something so salty that it still makes him wince.\nThe men didn\u2019t even like each other\u2019s clothes. \u201cHe was wearing, like, nautical shoes,\u201d Mr. Mattos said of Mr. Carter. \u201cI was like, \u2018If you dress like that, I will never walk down the street with you.\u2019 \u201d\nMr. Carter shot back, \u201cYou were wearing a T-shirt where it seemed like your nipple was hanging out.\u201d\nHow this odd couple managed to create Estela, which has attracted James Beard award nominations and visiting chefs from around the world (as well as President Obama), remains a curious and comedic tale of Manhattan restaurant-making. Like a long-married couple, or maybe Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, the two repeatedly insist that they love each other \u2014 even while operating in a frequent state of creative friction.\nTheir relationship, like Estela itself, is a case study in the mysteries of chemistry: Somehow the thing works, although nobody is quite sure why.\nEstela defies any capsule description. Mr. Mattos moved to New York from Uruguay in2006, but at Estela, his dishes (ricotta dumplings tucked under a beige veil of shaved mushrooms; briny mussels crowning aioli-smothered toast; tender lamb ribs with chermoula and honey) carry currents of Spain and Italy, the Middle East and North Africa.\nMr. Carter remembers the moment of reckoning when he sat down to try early drafts of those dishes: His doubts about Mr. Mattos drifted away. \u201cThe first thing that hit the table was the mussels escabeche,\u201d Mr. Carter said. \u201cI knew the food was going to be good, but I didn\u2019t know it would be that good. When you tasted it, everything made sense. The tartare. The mussels. The dumplings.\u201d\nEstela has detonated old-school protocols of menu progression. In the spirit of fussiness-eschewing European precursors like Cal Pep in Barcelona, Le Dauphin in Paris and Manfreds in Copenhagen, the overarching principle is the graze: Maybe you sit down at the bar for a single dish, but that blurs into two, or maybe you order four dishes to share with your friends, but then everyone springs for a second round after using chunks of bread to swipe away remaining patches of sauce. The improvisatory rhythm can be intoxicating or irritating, depending on how you like to eat.\n\u201cI would say it\u2019s refined wine-bar food,\u201d said Christine Muhlke, the executive editor of Bon App\u00e9tit magazine and one of the many food-media scouts who gravitated to Estela early on.\nWhat signifies the food as belonging to Mr. Mattos (who sometimes answers to Nacho and other times to Ig) is the appearance of radical simplicity. A dish may look like little more than a scoop of black rice flattened into a puck, but when a spoonful of that rice makes contact with the palate, a deeper complexity unfurls. \u201cThere\u2019s no jazz hands,\u201d Ms. Muhlke mused. \u201cThere\u2019s an absence of bells and whistles. But to remove the bells and whistles you have to be even more confident in your vision.\u201d\nStark and functional, Estela\u2019s brick-walled d\u00e9cor is thoroughly stripped of jangle, too. Mr. Carter and Mr. Mattos like to joke that when President Obama\u2019s dinner was drawing near last year, his advance team expected something a little more statesmanlike.\n\u201cThe Secret Service, they were so funny,\u201d Mr. Mattos said.\n\u201cThey were like, \u2018This is it?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Carter said.\nThe partners designed the space themselves \u2014 the lighting, the mirrors, the mismatched tables, all of it.\n\u201cWe had an architect for the first six weeks, and then we fired him,\u201d Mr. Carter said. Early renderings conveyed the sensation of being in \u201can industrial farmhouse sushi restaurant,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich is great if you\u2019re serving kaiseki.\u201d Even if they couldn\u2019t always articulate what they wanted, they had a sense of how the space was supposed to feel. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like we spent a lot of money,\u201d Mr. Carter said. \u201cAnd we didn\u2019t.\u201d\nAs with the early days of Mission Chinese Food or Roberta\u2019s, that strategically slapdash approach helped foster the impression that Estela was the authentic article \u2014 a restaurant made by real people, not consultants, for better or worse.\n\u201cYou walk in, and your first thought is that it\u2019s going to be awful,\u201d said Adam Sachs, the editor in chief of Saveur magazine. The tables are crammed together; the noise level is high. \u201cIt\u2019s built to reduce expectations, when you see it,\u201d he said.\nThe same could be said of Mr. Mattos, who often appears to be hiding in the kitchen and murmuring under his breath. \u201cFor all his mumbling, dissembling casualness, Ignacio knows exactly what he\u2019s doing,\u201d Mr. Sachs said.\nMr. Mattos developed a reputation as a sort of culinary prankster at Isa, where he had a habit of serving charred hay and fried sardine skeletons. Reviewing the restaurant for The New York Times in 2011, Eric Asimov wrote that \u201cwhile Isa can be idiosyncratic in the best sense, of going its own way, it\u2019s occasionally strange for no apparent reason.\u201d\nPam Yung, who cooks at Semilla in Brooklyn, worked alongside Mr. Mattos as the pastry chef at Isa, where she observed the chef\u2019s propensity to experiment and provoke. \u201cWe would always have these conversations like: \u2018Well, you\u2019re supposed to do it this way, so let\u2019s do it the opposite, wrong way,\u2019 \u201d she recalled. \u201c \u2018Let\u2019s put mushrooms in the dessert. Let\u2019s shock people.\u2019 \u201d\nLosing his job at Isa left Mr. Mattos bruised. \u201cHe really wanted to make a statement,\u201d Ms. Yung said. \u201cAnd people were sort of put off by it.\u201d\nTaavo Somer, the entrepreneur behind Isa, said the departure of Mr. Mattos boiled down to economics and \u201cthat balance between art and commerce.\u201d\n\u201cIt was about managing food costs and labor costs,\u201d Mr. Somer said. \u201cI think everyone is in agreement that he\u2019s an amazing chef and makes great food.\u201d\nIt was clear with Estela that Mr. Mattos intended to trade in curveballs for comfort. Ms. Yung said that just as much finesse is being applied to the food at Estela, but the handiwork is more invisible. \u201cHonestly, I can still tell how carefully it has been put together,\u201d she said. \u201cHe has put a lot of effort into making it look effortless.\u201d\nWith Caf\u00e9 Altro Paradiso on the horizon, the Estela duo faces an issue encountered by everyone who has achieved straight-out-of-the-gate success: how to make lightning strike twice. \u201cThe second album, the second novel,\u201d Mr. Carter said. \u201cI\u2019m worried. I\u2019m always worried. But we just have to do what we know.\u201d\nThey know more now, and expectations are different: Seat-of-the-pants has been replaced by custom tailoring. The new space, where Mr. Mattos will serve up his personal spin on classic Italian comfort food like pasta and bollito misto, comes with amenities that Estela never had, including high ceilings, a serious budget and an attention to detail so granular that Mr. Carter even talks about making sure that light from outside beguilingly \u201cfriscalates\u201d (his word for light glittering) through bottles of liquor at the bar.\nStill, there is plenty left to disagree about.\n\u201cWe always question each other,\u201d Mr. Mattos said as the two men ambled around SoHo Square, a small park right outside their new restaurant. \u201cLike, yesterday on the subway we were arguing about something that didn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d\nThe bickering, they say, is more Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid than King Kong versus Godzilla. \u201cWe love each other,\u201d Mr. Mattos said. Somehow, the squabbling is part of that. \u201cThere will be friction,\u201d Mr. Carter said. \u201cWe just handle it better now. Now we\u2019re not going to blow up in front of the staff. We fight over texts.\u201d\nAs they floated toward the southern end of the park, they came upon a statue of Gen. Jos\u00e9 Artigas, identified on the pedestal as the \u201cNational Hero of Uruguay.\u201d\n\u201cThis is actually Nacho\u2019s uncle,\u201d Mr. Carter said.\nMr. Mattos gazed at the statue and seemed to ponder the significance of its hovering a few steps away from his latest enterprise. He has an attentiveness to omens and vibrations, and if that, too, has something to do with his success thus far \u2014 well, who\u2019s to say?\n\u201cHe was the liberator of Uruguay from the Spanish,\u201d Mr. Mattos said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sign.\u201d", "date": "Oct. 27, 2015", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/28/dining/estela-ignacio-mattos-thomas-carter-cafe-altro-paradiso.html", "tags": "like carter lightning twice isa make mattos \u201d aim two strike estela partners said"}
