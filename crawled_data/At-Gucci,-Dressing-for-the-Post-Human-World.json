{"title": "At Gucci, Dressing for the Post-Human World", "content": "MILAN \u2014 Riddle me this: How is the theater of fashion like an operating theater?\nWith this question \u2014 raised by the Gucci show set: an antiseptic hospital-gown-green space with piercing overhead lights, medical beds strategically arrayed beneath \u2014 the Milan women\u2019s wear collections got into gear.\nWell, fashion is always something of a poser, in every sense of the word. The designer Alessandro Michele was simply serving notice that this time, he was making it real. Not just in his show manifesto, which name-checked the philosophers Michel Foucault and Donna J. Haraway \u2014 especially her 1984 essay \u201cA Cyborg Manifesto\u201d \u2014 but on his runway.\nAnd he did, with showgirl sparkle and kimono flowers; nerdy plaids and rhinestone pasties; pagoda hats and Joan Crawford velvet gowns. A scrim of plain tulle covered some looks, shielding them from the elements, and they were branded with a Gucci logo over the breast. One suit referenced the Yankees and Major League Baseball; on a cherry-red sweater, Paramount Pictures was embroidered on the chest next to giant feathered sleeves. Men\u2019s wear, women\u2019s wear, no matter.\nElton had gone vintage shopping at the flea market and come back in full-on personality play mode \u2014 which is to say, it was Mr. Michele\u2019s usual mixed bag of magical misfit muchness, taken to a newly accessorized extreme: not with bags (though they were there, too, in all sizes and shapes) but rather knitted face masks of all creepy kinds, copies of models\u2019 heads tucked in the crooks of their arms, rubber \u201cdragon puppies\u201d (that turned out to be baby dragons) clutched to the chest, and a third eye blinking from the broad expanse of a forehead.\nWhen, at the end of the show, a group of black-suited security guards emerged, joined hands and formed a human chain, protecting \u2026 it was not clear exactly what, and then began to whisper among themselves in confusion only to disappear whence they came, it only served to underscore the head-scratching nature of it all.\nMr. Michele sat at a news conference afterward in an oversize faded denim shirt and jeans, a Yankees cap resting on the velvet settee beside him, fingers covered in rings, and raised an eyebrow, sphinx-like, at the confusion. Did everyone really give up trying to figure it out? Faced with the, ahem, underarm faces, yes, they did.\n\u201cWe are all the Dr. Frankenstein of our lives,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cInventing, assembling, experimenting\u201d with identity as expressed through clothes, which \u201ccan accompany you while you develop an idea of yourself.\u201d We are all, he added, \u201chybrids\u201d now.\nMake sense? You know, it kind of did.\nRiddles, when they are good, make you think: They stick in your craw and keep you up at night mulling the answer. Mr. Michele\u2019s Gucci may be absurd in many ways, but it\u2019s impossible to ignore \u2014 and not just because it is so ubiquitous that it has become an adjective unto itself (\u201cthat\u2019s so Gucci\u201d), but because he has managed to encapsulate a messy moment of transition. It\u2019s a period of \u201cwhat if\u201d-ing and magical thinking; horror stories and alternative facts. Why not try on a new reality, literally and metaphorically, and see how it plays out?\nAlberta Ferretti did, and it went like this: What if a woman were at the center of the universe? What would we all look like then?\nIt\u2019s a relevant question and, to underscore it, Ms. Ferretti put an enormous metal sculpture by the Italian artist Lorenzo Quinn in the middle of her show space. Titled \u201cGravity,\u201d it depicted a naked women hanging by her hands from a crouching man. Gone was the fragile Ferretti woman of yore, all floaty chiffon filigree frocks and fairy tales; welcome the new, football pad-shouldered 1980s Ferretti, with a leather cape, a studded belt and a bit of disco shine amid a whole lot of black and dark denim. Also, some grape and burgundy suede.\nIt was a step in a different direction, for sure. And she was not alone \u2014 Max Mara also had an \u201980s moment, with a cacophony of corporate punk in pinstripes, leather (a lot of leather: bomber jackets and pencil skirts and pegged pants and gloves), angora print leopard and branded concert-type tees. Not to mention leather suspenders hanging off pretty much everything. They were supposed to be provocative, but mostly looked pointless.\nAfter all, the woman in the sculpture faced the future, and these clothes faced the past. Looking backward to go forward may be a strategy, but that does not make it an advance. We\u2019ve been there, worn that, bashed against that glass ceiling. Let\u2019s not repeat it, please.\nOr parody it, as Jeremy Scott\u2019s parade of a thousand and one alien Jackie Kennedy-a-likes at Moschino seemed to do.\nHere was the setup: What if Jackie was too good to be human and was, in fact, a creature from a galaxy far, far away, with green \u2014 or blue or yellow or pink \u2014 skin? What if Marilyn really did know something? Then the E.T. Jackie might have worn a pillbox hat and flip hairdo, and all sort of little squared-off 1960s skirt suits and coats and shifts in various Crayola colors, trimmed in patent and zips. And Marilyn might have wiggled by in big-bow-bustled satin sheaths for evening with star-spangled lighting bolts mixed in. Shazam!\nMrs. Kennedy was famously thin but as a concept, this was thinner \u2014 except there was a curve buried under all the camp and cartoons, and it was a doozy. Can you figure it out? Think hard.\nI\u2019ll give you a clue: aliens and presidents. In Mr. Scott\u2019s world, they went together like boucl\u00e9 and gold buttons. In the real world, it\u2019s a serious puzzle, he insinuated, that needs to be solved.", "date": "Feb. 22, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/22/style/gucci-alessandro-michele-milan-fashion-week.html", "tags": "like world gucci show post-human ferretti \u201d leather michele \u2014 dressing"}
