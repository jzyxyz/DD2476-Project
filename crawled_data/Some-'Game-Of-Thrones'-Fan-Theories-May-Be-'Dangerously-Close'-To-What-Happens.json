{"title": "Some 'Game Of Thrones' Fan Theories May Be 'Dangerously Close' To What Happens", "content": "From Tyrion is a Targaryen to Bran is the Night King, when it comes to \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d you know fan theories are coming. And as the show nears its end with the debut of Season 8, more continue to pop up like wights out of the snow.\nWhen HuffPost caught up with John Bradley last week after his appearance on Build Series, he was all for the surge of theories.\u00a0\n\u201cI think that this show has always asked more questions than it\u2019s answered,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the reason why theories are so prevalent is because we don\u2019t spoon-feed people everything, and I think that \u2015 this may sound a bit strange \u2015 I think you have to be quite smart to watch the show to its full capacity because you\u2019ve got to hold a lot of knowledge in your head, but also you\u2019ve got to fill in a lot of blanks yourself, and I think the people online doing that is very flattering and just goes to show how committed our audience are.\u201d\nMuch like his character Samwell Tarly is an expert on the history of Westeros, Bradley seems equally well-versed on the fan lore. And, yes, he admits some of the theories are a little too close for comfort.\n\u201cMost of them, with regards to the final season and just with regards to the show in general, are wide of the mark and they\u2019re interesting, but they\u2019re just not right ... they just don\u2019t get it right on a purely factual level,\u201d he said. \u201cBut some of them you read and, well, they\u2019re actually dangerously close to the truth. Some you think are actually uncomfortably veering quite close to what actually happens.\u201d\nHere\u2019s the problem with your somewhat accurate fan theories, however: For every one that\u2019s close, there are a million more that say something like \u201cVarys is secretly a fish man.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYou take comfort from the fact that they\u2019re kind of in amongst all the nonsense, so as long as they\u2019re swamped by nonsense, as long as they\u2019re kind of the grain of sand on the beach of nonsense, then you\u2019re happy because you think people might take this \u2014 insert your favorite theory here \u2014 as being the truth,\u201d Bradley added. \u201cThey may take the theory that Lord Varys is a mermaid is the truth. As long as the truth and such nonsense sit side by side, people are never going to quite get to the bottom of it.\u201d\nNonsense or not, some of the theories out there are particularly captivating (shoutout to Cleganebowl), so Bradley was kind enough to share his thoughts on a few of them.\nThe Season 2 finale features a harrowing moment when Sam Tarly is seen by a White Walker as the army of the dead passes by. For reasons still unknown, he\u2019s left unscathed, leading to countless amounts of speculation.\nBradley himself said he didn\u2019t know exactly why the White Walker spared Sam, but did offer some theories that he\u2019s heard about the moment.\n\u201cOne of the theories is kind of the leader of the White Walkers in that moment is the White Walker of Benjen Stark. I\u2019ve read that, and that he \u2014 through some White Walker powers \u2014 knows what Sam means to Jon and therefore he spares him because of that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s another one that White Walkers will only attack something that fights back, that they almost didn\u2019t feel Sam was worth killing, which is the greatest insult. It was an interesting thing to film that because it was the final moment of the season as well, so it\u2019s one of those cut-to-black [scenes] again where we had people guessing for a year.\u201d\nSamwell Tarly is often looked at as a representative for author George R.R. Martin in his \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire\u201d series. One popular theory is that in the end the story will get very meta as Sam begins to write Martin\u2019s books, chronicling the stories of Westeros. This got extra support when Sam arrived at the Citadel in Season 6 and saw a gyroscope that looks like what we\u2019ve been watching in the show\u2019s opening for years. And even more evidence: In Season 7, Sam suggests Archmaester Ebrose (Jim Broadbent) call his \u201cChronicle of the Wars Following the Death of King Robert I\u201d something \u201ca bit more poetic.\u201d\nBradley expressed his admiration for the theory, telling us, \u201cThat\u2019s a really interesting one, and it feeds into George\u2019s Tolkien influence. The fact he\u2019s called George R.R. Martin tells you quite a lot about him. I think at the end, that\u2019s an interesting one that kind of followed the show around, and the thing about seeing the opening gyrosphere thing, that kind of feeds into it.\u201d\u00a0\nThe theory puts Sam right at the center of the story, which is part of the reason Bradley likes it so much.\n\u201cAs an actor, you just want your character to be important, especially in a show like this where not everybody gets a load of screen time,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes you\u2019re not in an episode at all. Sometimes you get one or two scenes in an episode. What you really want is for it to end and to think, \u2018Well, that wouldn\u2019t have actually ended that way if it wasn\u2019t for my character.\u2019 I think any theory that puts Sam at the center of things or, for Kit [Harington], puts Jon at the center of things or any actor puts their character at the center of things, they are the kind of theories you latch on to.\u201d\nWith Sam having pilfered some books from the Citadel in Season 7, we had to ask, \u201cDo one of those books finally reveal what Podrick Payne did to make the ladies like him so much in Season 3?\u201d\n\u201cDo you know what, that\u2019s the biggest mystery of the show that I want to find out,\u201d Bradley said with a laugh. \u201cYeah, I mean, in terms of the great mysteries of the show, you talk about \u2018Why did the White Walkers spare Sam,\u2019 and people want to know about Podrick first and foremost. I think Sam lives on quite a high intellectual plane, thank you very much, so if there was an index, and he went down the index, and it said \u2018Podrick [brothels]\u2019 I don\u2019t think he\u2019d bother himself reading that. He\u2019s got bigger fish to fry.\u201d\nWhen all is said and done, it probably doesn\u2019t matter to theorists what actually happens. They\u2019ll stick by their own beliefs.\n\u201cThe thing about all these theories is there\u2019s evidence to support them, but people don\u2019t want to know about the evidence that doesn\u2019t support them,\u201d Bradley said. \u201cThere\u2019s so much evidence that contradicts the supportive evidence, but people don\u2019t want to know about that. If people want to support a theory, they\u2019ll believe it.\u201d\nVarys-is-a-mermaid stans unite.", "date": "\n04/09/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/game-of-thrones-fan-theories-john-bradley_n_5ca6623ce4b047edf9577f8a", "tags": "people may think happens sam show theories close \u201d bradley one fan thrones"}
