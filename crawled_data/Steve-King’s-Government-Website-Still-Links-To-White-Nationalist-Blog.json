{"title": "Steve King\u2019s Government Website Still Links To White Nationalist Blog", "content": "Weeks after claiming to denounce racism and bigotry, Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) is still using his official government website to direct his constituents to a white nationalist blog that regularly publishes the work of vile racists, anti-Semites, and Nazi sympathizers, HuffPost has found. \nThe top of King\u2019s house.gov website currently features a YouTube video of King, in a Jan. 15 speech on the floor of the House of Representatives, claiming to reject the \u201cevil ideology\u201d of white supremacy. \u201cThat ideology never shows up in my head,\u201d he tells his congressional colleagues, who were voting on a resolution condemning racist comments King made this month to The New York Times. \nYet just beneath King\u2019s YouTube video is a link to \u201cIllegal Immigrant Stories,\u201d a section of King\u2019s website he\u2019s devoted to cherry-picked news articles falsely portraying Latinos as prone to committing crimes. Many of the news clips King cites are from disreputable far-right propaganda outlets like Breitbart, The Daily Caller, WorldNetDaily, and The Gateway Pundit. One of the news clips King uses is from the patently white nationalist website VDare.com. \nVDare is a hate site named after Virginia Dare, said to be the first white baby born in the \u201cNew World.\u201d It has routinely featured the writing of eugenicists, anti-Semites and Nazi sympathizers, including prominent white supremacists Richard Spencer, Kevin MacDonald, Sam Francis and Jared Taylor.\nKing\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a HuffPost request for comment Tuesday as to why, if King rejects the \u201cevil ideology\u201d of white nationalism, he\u2019s still using his official government website to promote and legitimize a white nationalist website. \nKing\u2019s house.gov website specifically directs readers to a 2016 VDare piece headlined \u201cDrunk Driving Illegal Alien Kills Woman, Is Granted Bail and Disappears.\u201d The article is by Brenda Walker, a deeply racist anti-immigrant blogger. \nWalker has written that Mexicans are \u201can ethnic group that has neither interest nor aptitude.\u201d She has stated, falsely, that \u201cthe influx of millions of Mexicans has brought their way of crime, including kidnapping, along [sic] the rest of their culture.\u201d \nWalker has also stated, falsely, that \u201csex with children is socially acceptable in Mexico\u201d and that \u201cHispanics, and particularly Mexicans, are academic underachievers because their culture does not value education.\u201d \nMedia Matters first reported in June 2018 that King was citing Walker\u2019s VDare article on his house.gov website. That report was then cited in multiple major news outlets, including a July 2018 HuffPost article that argued King is a white supremacist \u2014 an article King read. \nHuffPost first asked King if he\u2019s a white nationalist in December 2017, after he tweeted \u201cdiversity is not our strength.\u201d We asked again, in June 2018, after he promoted a neo-Nazi on Twitter. We asked in August, after he promoted another white supremacist on Twitter. We asked again in September, after we unearthed an interview he gave to an Austrian website affiliated with Europe\u2019s neo-fascist \u201cidentitarian\u201d movement. \nHe never denied being a white nationalist to us. In October, he told an Iowa TV host that he didn\u2019t think the term \u201cwhite nationalist\u201d was derogatory. He won re-election anyway in November, but by the slimmest margin of his long congressional career. \u00a0\nIt was only earlier this month \u2014 after he told The New York Times he didn\u2019t understand why terms like \u201cwhite supremacy\u201d and \u201cwhite nationalism\u201d were offensive \u2014 that House GOP leadership decided to punish him, stripping him of his committee assignments. \nAn effort by two rank-and-file House Democrats to censure him, a rare and formal reprimand, was quashed by Democratic leadership over fears that it would set a precedent for punishing speech made outside the House of Representatives.\n\u201cObviously, it\u2019s not what I want,\u201d Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), told reporters after his resolution to censure King was rejected. \u201cThe next time something like this happens, we\u2019ll bring it out of committee, and I think we move to expel him at that point.\u201d\nMajor GOP figures including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, and Rep. Liz Cheney, the chairwoman of the House Republican Conference, along with a slew of rank-and-file Republicans and Democrats, called on King to resign. \nKing has said, however, that he will not resign, and has made the dubious claim that The New York Times took his comments about white supremacy out of context. \nEarlier this month, Iowa state Sen. Randy Feenstra announced that he will challenge King in next year\u2019s Republican primary.
