{"title": "Rep--Elect Ilhan Omar Says She'll Work To Lift Ban On Religious Headwear In Congress", "content": "Minnesota Representative-elect Ilhan Omar said Sunday she was ready to challenge a 181-year-old ban on headwear on the floor of the House of Representatives.\nDemocrats last week announced their intention to change a House rule that prohibits members from wearing hats on the chamber floor. The rule could technically bar the wearing of headscarves, an item of religious attire that Omar herself wears.\nAlong with Michigan\u2019s Rashida Tlaib, Omar is one of the first Muslim women ever elected to Congress. She was born in Somalia before coming to the U.S. at age 12.\nThe change is part of a scope of new rules that Democrats are planning to implement once they take control of the House next year following their sweep of seats across the country during this month\u2019s midterm elections. The party picked up at least 37 seats, wresting control from the Republicans after eight years.\u00a0\nOmar posted a screenshot of a news article related to the ban on Instagram late Sunday.\n\u201cNo one puts a scarf on my head but me,\u201d Omar wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s my choice \u2015 one protected by the First Amendment.\u201d\nShe also said it\u2019s not the only ban she would work to lift, but didn\u2019t specify any others.\nThe Washington Post notes that the proposed rule \u2015 of which Omar is a co-author alongside House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) and Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) \u2015 would allow all religious headwear on the House floor.\nHuffPost\u2019s \u201cHer Stories\u201d newsletter brings you even more reporting from around the world on the important issues affecting women.\u00a0Sign up for it here.", "date": "\n11/19/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ilhan-omar-headscarves-congress_n_5bf24bc9e4b07573881fc88d", "tags": "religious congress work omar rule house rep -- elect says one ilhan headwear \u201d \u2015 floor ban lift"}
