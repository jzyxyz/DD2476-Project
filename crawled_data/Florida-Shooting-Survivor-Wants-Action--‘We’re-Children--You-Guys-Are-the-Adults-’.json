You Guys Are the Adults.\u2019", "content": "PARKLAND, Fla. \u2014 For the latest on the Florida school shooting, read Friday\u2019s live updates.\nDavid Hogg stood in the Florida sun on Thursday, not far from his now shuttered school, and described the events of the day before.\nMr. Hogg, 17, a lanky senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and the student news director there, was in his environmental science class when a single shot rang out, echoing down the hallways.\nHis teacher pulled the door shut, but soon the fire alarm began to blare. Then, he said, came the sound of thousands of student footsteps, and Mr. Hogg and his classmates raced out the door, joining a giant wave of teenagers.\n\u201cThere was a tsunami of people running in one specific direction away from something,\u201d he said, \u201cand that\u2019s what we were doing. It was almost like there was a shark coming along and we were a school of fish. And we were running from that armed man.\u201d\nA janitor appeared and began to wave. \u201cStop, stop!\u201d he said. \u201cGo over here!\u201d\nThen the school chef opened a door to her office, Mr. Hogg said, and hurried the teenagers in \u2014 first 10, then 20, then some 30 or 40 students crowded in the office. They shut off the lights. And then students turned to their phones, and began the horrifying experience of watching a school shooting unfold at their own school \u2014 through the news apps on their phones.\nWhile they were hiding, Mr. Hogg proceeded to interview his classmates on camera about their beliefs on gun policy.\nMr. Hogg\u2019s younger sister, 14, was also in the building. Two of her best friends were among the 17 people who died, he said.\n\u201cOn a national scale, I\u2019m not surprised at all,\u201d he said of the shooting. \u201cAnd that\u2019s just sad. The fact that a student is not surprised that there was another mass shooting \u2014 but this time it was at his school \u2014 says so much about the current state that our country is in, and how much has to be done.\u201d\nThe violence must stop, he said, issuing a call to pressure lawmakers to act to make schools safer.\n\u201cWe need to do something. We need to get out there and be politically active. Congress needs to get over their political bias with each other and work toward saving children\u2019s lives.\u201d\nIn an interview with CNN earlier on Thursday, Mr. Hogg expressed his frustration with politicians in simpler terms: \u201cWe\u2019re children,\u201d he said. \u201cYou guys are the adults.\u201d\nKelsey Friend, a freshman at the school, appeared alongside Mr. Hogg on CNN, and grew emotional as she thanked a geography teacher who she said had saved her life.\n\u201cI will never forget the actions that he took for me and for fellow students of the classroom,\u201d she said through tears. \u201cAnd if his family is watching this, please know that your son or your brother was an amazing person and I\u2019m alive today because of him. Thank you.\u201d\n[RELATED: A Visual Guide to the Florida School Shooting]\nOther students shared stories of the ordeal as well.\nSarah Crescitelli, a freshman, said Wednesday that she was in drama class when gunshots rang out. While hiding with about 40 others in a storage room, she texted her mother, telling her, \u201cIf I don\u2019t make it, I love you.\u201d\nOthers, who spoke to CNN, described how a large group hid in an R.O.T.C. room where they used Kevlar blankets from a marksmanship class for protection.\nAt a news conference on Thursday, Robert Runcie, the superintendent of Broward County Public Schools, called for a national conversation on passing \u201csensible\u201d gun control laws.\n\u201cOur students are asking for that conversation,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I hope we can get it done in this generation. But if we don\u2019t, they will.\u201d", "date": "Feb. 15, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/15/us/david-hogg-florida-shooting.html", "tags": "shooting \u2018 adults guys hogg wants \u201d school children florida \u2014 action students survivor"}
