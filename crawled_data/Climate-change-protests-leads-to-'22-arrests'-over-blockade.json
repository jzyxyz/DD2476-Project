There were 15 arrests.\nThe organisers insist that this week\u2019s actions will be non-violent. They say if protesters commit an illegal act, they must stay on the spot to face the police.\nThe police told BBC News they expected disruption on Saturday and were prepared for any level of protest. \nA member of the London Mayor\u2019s office wondered privately if the protesters thought that freeing protesters from cycle locks was a good use of police time. \nBut Lizia Wolf told BBC News she felt compelled to act.\n\u201cThe facts and figures are easily accessible if you have the stomach to look, but here within Extinction Rebellion and certainly with myself, is an offer of friendship, guidance and mutual grief.\n\u201cThe first step towards creating the changes necessary for survival - and towards solving any problem in general - is to acknowledge the utterly terrifying situation we are in.\u201d \nThe protesters\u2019 short-term aims are to cancel what they call \u201ccontradictory\u201d projects they say will actually increase emissions in the UK, such as the third runway at Heathrow, fracking and the \u00a330bn roads programme.\nTheir long-term aims are to: \nThe aim of persuading some cabinet members to speak out may possibly be achievable.\nBut experts say achieving a zero-emissions economy by 2025 isn\u2019t in any scenario. It would need a revolution in transport, home insulation, energy efficiency, agriculture and more.\nSetting up an assembly of mostly randomly selected citizens to take charge of the great economic shift will surely not be accepted by politicians.\nAt the media launch of Extinction Rebellion, one young woman teared up, asking whether runaway climate change was an acceptable choice, when it was suggested that their demands were unlikely to be met.\nAnother protester, Tiana Jacout, 31, from Bristol, told BBC News: \u201cFinally! Someone has given us all permission to rage against the idea that we are barrelling towards extinction.\n\u201cWe have been invited to decide, between those unbearable nights of watching the slow-moving car crash that is how humanity treats the world, or standing up for the world we know is possible. \n\u201cI am happy to give up my freedom for the idea of that, that others can see a better world.\"\nThe protesters were boosted by a letter from 100 academics in the Guardian \u2013 including the former Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams.\nIt said the failure of politicians to tackle climate breakdown and the growing extinction crisis means \u201cthe 'social contract' has been broken\u2026 [and] it is therefore not only our right, but our moral duty to bypass the government\u2019s inaction and flagrant dereliction of duty, and to rebel to defend life itself.\u201d\nDespite uncertainties in forecasts about the rate of heating, many senior scientists working on environmental change are genuinely alarmed by the huge risks mankind is taking.\nBut can the UK really de-carbonise by 2025? Three professors concerned about the issue - Peter Cox, Jim Skea and Piers Forster - did not believe the timetable demanded by the Extinction Rebellion was possible. \nTo the protesters, this won\u2019t matter much. \nThey\u2019re harnessing new media to shake up what they see as society\u2019s complacency. \nThey say failing to protect the climate isn\u2019t an option.\nFollow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin", "date": "12 November 2018", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46172661", "tags": "extinction arrests protests uk rebellion world leads blockade protesters climate change say police"}
