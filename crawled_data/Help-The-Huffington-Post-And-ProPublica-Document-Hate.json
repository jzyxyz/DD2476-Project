{"title": "Help The Huffington Post And ProPublica Document Hate", "content": "A cloud of fear has settled over many Americans since Donald Trump was elected president.\nSince Nov. 8, people have been shot, synagogues have been threatened, and even children aren\u2019t spared from bigotry. But how much are these acts of hate on the rise?\nIt\u2019s hard to say. That\u2019s because there\u2019s no comprehensive government database that tracks violence, harassment, vandalism, intimidation or bullying motivated by hate.\nTo better understand what is happening around the country,\u00a0The Huffington Post has partnered with ProPublica, a nonprofit news organization dedicated to investigative journalism, and other news outlets to create a database of reported acts of hate and bias incidents. By gathering this information, we will create a clearer picture of what is happening in America. \nIf you have been the victim of a hate crime or witnessed someone else being attacked, tell us about it by filling in the form below. Please include your contact information, so reporters can follow up with you to investigate the incident.\nThe form is not a report to law enforcement or any government agency.", "date": "\n03/23/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/hate-crimes-tracker_n_58d3fd28e4b0b22b0d1abc26?8svic8grc9x561or", "tags": "hate since news create information happening huffington help form document acts propublica post database government"}
