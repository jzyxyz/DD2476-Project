Though little hard information has emerged about the attacks, American and Gulf suspicions have centered on Iran, in an area already jittery about the prospect of a violent clash with the republic.\nThe Trump administration has warned of planned aggression by Iran or its proxies, though it has not elaborated on that contention, and it has deployed military forces to the region.\nBut both sides said Tuesday that they were not looking for a war, even as the threats and counterthreats continued.\nIran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said in comments carried on state television that \u201cno war is going to happen,\u201d The Associated Press reported.\n\u201cNeither we, nor they are seeking war,\u201d he said. \u201cThey know that it is not to their benefit.\u201d\nAnd in a visit to Russia on Tuesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said, \u201cWe fundamentally do not seek a war with Iran.\u201d\nBut the Trump administration has not ruled out further increasing the American military presence in the region.\nResponding to a New York Times report that Pentagon officials were drawing up plans to deploy as many as 120,000 troops to the Middle East, Mr. Trump called it \u201cfake news\u201d and said that \u201cwe have not planned for that.\u201d\n\u201cHopefully we\u2019re not going to have to plan for that,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd if we did that, we\u2019d send a hell of a lot more troops than that.\u201d\nThe four ships were damaged on Sunday in coastal waters near the Strait of Hormuz, the vital waterway to the Persian Gulf, through which much of the world\u2019s oil flows.\nThe Saudi government said two of the ships were Saudi tankers, identified by industry officials as Al Marzoqah and the Amjad, and a Norwegian shipping company said another was one of its tankers, the Andrea Victory. The fourth was an Emirati tanker.\nSaudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have said they were investigating the attacks.\nA senior Defense Department official said Tuesday that based on a \u201cholistic assessment,\u201d the military believes that \u201cIran is likely\u201d behind the tanker attacks. However American officials said there was no definitive evidence linking Iran or its proxies to the attacks.\nIran suggested Tuesday that the tanker attacks were a provocation intended to escalate tensions.\nForeign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif of Iran said that it had \u201cpreviously predicted that such actions would occur to create tensions in the region,\u201d according to IRNA, a state news agency.\nSpeaking in New Delhi, he also warned of the danger posed by \u201cextremist individuals in the U.S. government.\u201d\nMr. Zarif and other Iranian officials have sought to portray President Trump\u2019s national security adviser, John R. Bolton, as a warmonger eager to push the two countries into conflict.\nMr. Pompeo said Tuesday that the United States was still trying to get more information about the attacks.\n\u201cWe\u2019re working diligently to get answers to what caused those ships to have the problems that they have today,\u201d he said at a news conference in Sochi, Russia.\nThe attack on the Saudi oil facilities added a new element to the tensions.\nA Houthi-run television station, Al Masirah, reported that seven drones had \u201ctargeted vital Saudi facilities.\u201d\nThe Saudi energy minister, Khalid al-Falih, said the attacks on two pumping stations had caused \u201climited damage.\u201d He said the government was shutting down a pipeline while it assessed the damage and made repairs.\n\u201cThe Kingdom condemns this cowardly attack,\u201d Mr. Falih said in a statement. \u201cAnd this recent terrorist and sabotage act in the Arabian Gulf against vital installations not only targets the kingdom, but also targets the safety of the world\u2019s energy supply and the global economy.\u201d\nSaudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are fighting the Houthis in Yemen to restore the government that the Houthis ousted from the capital, Sanaa, in late 2014. The war in Yemen is viewed as another front in the regional power struggle between Saudi Arabia and Iran.\nSaudi Arabia considers the Houthis an Iranian proxy. The Houthis receive support from Iran, but deny that they are an Iranian proxy.\nThe affected pipeline runs from the oil production areas in the eastern part of the country to the Red Sea in the West, where the Saudis maintain export facilities. Those facilities help ensure they can continue to export oil if they have difficulties doing so from the Persian Gulf.\nSadad I. Al-Husseni, a former executive vice president of Saudi Aramco, said the strikes did not pose a serious risk to the Saudi infrastructure.\n\u201cThe facilities in the kingdom were designed at a time when there were wars going on in the Gulf,\u201d he said. \u201cSo everything was redesigned and upgraded in order to take advantage or make allowances for the security aspects.\u201d", "date": "May 14, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/world/middleeast/saudi-oil-attack.html", "tags": "iran escalating rebels saudi \u201d oil yemen attacks tuesday tensions attack gulf facilities houthi"}
