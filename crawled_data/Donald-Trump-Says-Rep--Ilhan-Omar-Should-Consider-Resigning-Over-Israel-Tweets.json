{"title": "Donald Trump Says Rep- Ilhan Omar Should Consider Resigning Over Israel Tweets", "content": "President Donald Trump on Tuesday called on Rep. llhan Omar (D-Minn.) to either resign from Congress or step down from a House committee assignment over recent tweets some lawmakers decried as anti-Semitic.\n\u201cI think she should either resign from Congress or she should certainly resign from the House Foreign Affairs Committee,\u201d the president told reporters on Tuesday.\nOmar apologized Monday after congressional Democratic leadership condemned comments she made on Twitter a day earlier about pro-Israel lobbying. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) accused Omar of using \u201canti-Semitic tropes\u201d in her tweets.\nOmar, who in November became one of the first Muslim women elected to Congress, was met with swift backlash Sunday when she responded to a journalist\u2019s tweet about House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy\u2019s (R-Calif.) threat to take action against Omar over her criticism of Israel.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about the Benjamins baby,\u201d the Minnesota lawmaker tweeted,\u00a0a reference to a popular mid-1990s rap song by Puff Daddy in which \u201cBenjamins\u201d is slang for $100 bills. The tweet appeared to suggest McCarthy\u2019s pro-Israel stance is motivated by money.\nOne Twitter user criticized Omar for the tweet, asking who the freshman lawmaker believes is paying American politicians to support Israel.\n\u201cAnti-Semitism is real and I am grateful for Jewish allies and colleagues who are educating me on the painful history of anti-Semitic tropes,\u201d Omar wrote in her statement Monday. \u201cMy intention is never to offend my constituents or Jewish Americans as a whole.\u201d\nOmar has maintained that her criticism of Israel\u2019s government should not be viewed as an attack on Judaism, noting in her statement Monday that she still believes lobbying plays a \u201cproblematic role\u201d in politics.\nTrump\u2019s call for Omar to consider resigning offers a stark contrast to his position on white supremacist Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa). King, who has espoused Islamophobic and white nationalist views for years, hasn\u2019t faced any calls to resign from Trump.\u00a0\nLast month, King told The New York Times that he wasn\u2019t sure when terms like \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d and \u201cWestern civilization\u201d became \u201coffensive.\u201d He later claimed he had only intended to refer to \u201cWestern civilization.\u201d\nHis comments to the Times prompted calls for his resignation from both Democratic and Republican lawmakers, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). But not Trump.\n\u201cI really haven\u2019t been following it,\u201d the president told reporters a few days later.\nDemocratic lawmakers have criticized Trump for not taking a harder stand against anti-Semitism, especially in the wake of the deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017.\nWhite nationalism supporters and counterprotesters clashed during the event, which left one woman dead when a neo-Nazi rammed his car into a crowd of people.\n\u201cWe condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides,\u201d Trump said hours after the incident.\nTwo days later, following heated bipartisan backlash for not taking a stronger stance against white supremacy, Trump finally announced that \u201cracism is evil.\u201d\n\u201cThose who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans,\u201d he said.\nBut a day later, Trump said at a press conference that there were \u201csome very fine people\u201d on both sides of the rally.\nThis story has been updated with more background information on Trump\u2019s actions.", "date": "\n02/12/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-ilhan-omar-resign_n_5c62ff37e4b00ba63e4b0e3f", "tags": "later resigning consider omar israel trump \u201d white donald says resign ilhan house rep- congress tweets"}
