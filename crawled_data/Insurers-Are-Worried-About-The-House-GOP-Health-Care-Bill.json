{"title": "Insurers Are Worried About The House GOP Health Care Bill", "content": "The main industry groups representing health insurance companies have broken their silence on the Republican bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act and \u201creplace\u201d it with smaller reforms.\nAmerica\u2019s Health Insurance Plans and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association are concerned that the GOP plan provides too little financial assistance for people buying their own health insurance and cuts Medicaid funding too much.\nThe health insurer lobbying organizations stopped far short of other health care interests, including the American Medical Association and the American Hospital Association, that have already stated their opposition to the bill promoted by House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and endorsed by President Donald Trump. Republicans are scrambling to get the bill to Trump\u2019s desk before Congress\u2019 Easter recess, which begins April 10.\nBut given that much of the GOP rhetoric about the Affordable Care Act\u2019s flaws has focused on the financial losses some insurers have suffered under the law and the unaffordable premiums facing a segment of their consumers, it\u2019s not a good sign that America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans\u00a0(AHIP) has gone public with its misgivings about the bill that\u2019s supposed to solve those things.\n\u201cWe offer our comments on the recently-introduced American Health Care Act in the spirit of working collaboratively with Congress and the Administration to find practical, workable solutions that improve affordability, value, and access,\u201d Marilyn Tavenner, AHIP\u2019s chief executive, wrote in a letter to House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Ga.) and House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden (R-Ore.) on Wednesday.\nThe trade groups did compliment the bill in several key respects.\nAHIP supports the fact that the legislation doesn\u2019t touch Medicare or job-based health insurance. And both associations approve of certain specific measures, such as making available billions of dollars for states that need to shore up insurers. That and other provisions are designed to stabilize the health insurance market in the next several years before the GOP\u2019s bigger changes would take effect. Insurers also support being able to charge older customers higher rates.\nBut insurers believe that eliminating the financial penalties associated with the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate \u2015 which the Republican bill would do retroactively to Dec. 31, 2015 \u2015 \u201cwould add short-term instability in the market.\u201d In its memo, Blue Cross Blue Shield Association specifically requested that market-stabilization measures offering funding for the highest-cost patients be extended past 2019.\nAHIP and the Blue Cross group also believe the financial assistance that Republicans would provide is too meager to promote widespread health coverage. The GOP bill pegs its tax credits to age\u00a0rather than income, unlike the Affordable Care Act.\n\u201cTax credits related to age as well as income will help ensure that more people stay covered, and are the most effective way to allocate taxpayer dollars,\u201d wrote Tavenner, who oversaw Affordable Care Act programs as a senior official in President Barack Obama\u2019s administration before joining the industry group in 2015.\nAHIP uses stronger terms to describe Republican plans to cap federal spending on Medicaid beneficiaries beginning three years from now. The Blue Cross Blue Shield Association also recommended higher Medicaid spending.\n\u201cAs a core principle, we believe that Medicaid funding should be adequate to meet the healthcare needs of beneficiaries. We are concerned that key components of the proposed new funding formulas starting in 2020 ... could result in unnecessary disruptions in the coverage and care beneficiaries depend on,\u201d Tavenner wrote. These cuts specifically could weaken Medicaid coverage of mental health and opioid addiction, she said.\nThis story has been updated with information from the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association.\n\u00a0", "date": "\n03/08/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/health-insurers-worried-about-house-gop-health-care-bill_n_58c07edbe4b0d1078ca3b849", "tags": "insurers gop worried \u201d house insurance act blue association affordable bill care health"}
