{"title": "Cable Hosts Taunt Donald Trump Over Tax 'Bombshell'- 'Con Man In Chief'", "content": "Cable news network hosts swooped in on Tuesday\u2019s report in The New York Times that said President Donald Trump\u00a0had\u00a0racked up almost $1.2 billion in business losses between 1985 and 1994.\nAnchors on CNN and MSNBC focused on the claims that Trump lost more money during that time period than any other individual taxpayer, including in 1987, when he published the best-selling business book \u201cThe Art of the Deal.\u201d\nCNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo addressed Trump directly as he explained how the report raised \u201clegit questions about stock manipulation, lies about your income, lies about your wealth\u201d and \u201ccurious income reporting on interest.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNone of that is good for your brand or your credibility,\u201d he said.\nCuomo later noted the irony of how Trump\u2019s business fortunes were turned around (at least in part) by Jeff Zucker, who offered Trump the chance to host \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d reality TV show. Zucker is now president of CNN, which Trump repeatedly trashes as \u201cfake news.\u201d\nCheck out the clip here:\nDon Lemon began his \u201cCNN Tonight\u201d show by claiming that the president was \u201ca fraud and a con man, and the fraud and the con is on us, the American people.\u201d\n\u201cAudit, schmaudit,\u201d he added. \u201cIt turns out Donald Trump is our con man in chief, and his biggest con was pulling the wool right over your eyes, convincing voters that he would be the best dealmaker ever in the White House.\u201d\nCheck out the clip here:\nCNN\u2019s Erin Burnett said Trump was \u201cliterally, the biggest loser.\u201d\nCheck out the clip here:\nCNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper also riffed on Trump being \u201cthe biggest loser, to use a term he would use if he was labeling someone else.\u201d\nCheck out the clip here:\nMSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow\u00a0called the \u201cbombshell\u201d report fascinating because the losses covered a \u201ctime of his life when the president was marketing himself as being the most successful businessman of his age.\u201d\n\u201cHonestly, if I had $100 million in cash and a warehouse full of matches, I could not figure out how to burn $100 million over the course of a year, let alone how to do it every year for 10 straight years, but that is the business acumen that he had which he has nevertheless marketed to Americans as a success story.\u201d\nCheck out the clip here:\nAnd on Fox News, the widely watched conservative network whose prime-time hosts regularly defend Trump, Sean Hannity downplayed the report. He said Trump was \u201cstill a billionaire\u201d and \u201cstill president.\u201d He noted that \u201cbusinesses fail every day\u201d and the Trump Organization was \u201cstill an overwhelming American success story.\u201d\nCheck out the clip, via Media Matters, here:", "date": "\n05/08/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-tax-returns-cable-reaction_n_5cd275a4e4b0a7dffcce82c2", "tags": "taunt tax report clip business president man chief trump \u201d cnn donald hosts cable check"}
