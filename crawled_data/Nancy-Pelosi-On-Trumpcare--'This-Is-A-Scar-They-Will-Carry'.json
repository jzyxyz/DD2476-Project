{"title": "Nancy Pelosi On Trumpcare- 'This Is A Scar They Will Carry'", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2015 House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) warned Republicans on Thursday that voting in favor of their plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act will haunt them in the future.\n\u201cThey have this vote tattooed on them. This is a scar they will carry,\u201d Pelosi said during a weekly press briefing on Capitol Hill.\nRepublican leaders scheduled a vote on the American Health Care Act, otherwise known as Trumpcare, for Thursday afternoon, just hours after posting the bill\u2019s text online. The legislation has not yet undergone a review by the Congressional Budget Office \u2015 which would provide key information as to how many people would be covered under the law.\nAfter weeks of fits and starts, including one canceled vote, House Republicans\u00a0appear to have the votes to send the legislation to the Senate, where it faces a much more uncertain future.\u00a0\nPelosi knows a thing or two about consequential votes. Democrats\u2019 support for Obamacare helped cost them the House majority in 2010. To make matters worse for Republicans, the American Health Care Act is more unpopular today than the Affordable Care Act was in 2010.\nOn Thursday, the minority leader said she welcomed debate on health care. She added the vote would \u201cprovide a great civics lesson\u201d to Americans who are following how their members of Congress vote on the GOP bill.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s very little chance that this bill will be passed by the Senate. They\u2019re making a very bad move,\u201d she said, adding Republicans are in a \u201close-lose situation.\u201d", "date": "\n05/04/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/nancy-pelosi-health-care-trump_n_590b43e9e4b0d5d90499e041?z6", "tags": "thursday trumpcare- house act pelosi republicans vote scar carry care nancy"}
