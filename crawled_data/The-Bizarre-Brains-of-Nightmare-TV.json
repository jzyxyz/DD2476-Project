{"title": "The Bizarre Brains of Nightmare TV", "content": "ON first viewing, the comedy sketches on \u201cTim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!\u201d can seem like outtakes from a public-access channel that\u2019s broadcast only in hell. They are full of shoddily produced, sloppily edited talk shows about acne and commercials for utterly unnecessary gadgets, and populated by people who should never stand within 50 feet of a camera lens.\nWhen these elements appear in a typical television program, they\u2019re usually a result of accidents, budgetary restrictions and bad choices. When they appear on \u201cAwesome Show,\u201d they\u2019re intentional.\n\u201cWe have a very strict set of rules of what we think is funny,\u201d said Eric Wareheim, who created and stars in the series with Tim Heidecker.\n\u201cAnd,\u201d Mr. Heidecker added, \u201cI guess those would be, in no particular order: darkness, discomfort, confusion and things that shouldn\u2019t exist.\u201d\nLovingly described by its architects as \u201cthe nightmare version of television,\u201d \u201cAwesome Show\u201d (which returns to the Cartoon Network\u2019s after-hours Adult Swim lineup Sunday night for its third season) revels in an aesthetic of awkwardness. It favors quick sketches about pathetic office workers and desperate on-air pitchmen, and music videos for scatological songs. It elevates people recruited from the streets of Los Angeles to the status of celebrities and treats the celebrities who appear on the show as unwanted extras.\nIf, as its creators argue, there is humor in aberration, then \u201cAwesome Show\u201d is their vision of a nonstop laugh riot. \u201cYou know you\u2019ve got something great,\u201d Mr. Heidecker said, \u201cwhen it makes you say out loud, \u2018Why is this on TV?\u2019\u00a0\u201d\nSince meeting as film students at Temple University in the 1990s, Mr. Heidecker and Mr. Wareheim, both 32-year-old Pennsylvania natives, have noticed that their comedic sensibilities differed greatly from societal norms. At college they created short films that anticipated their \u201cAwesome Show\u201d milieu \u2014 e.g., a sloppily edited promotional trailer for a cat film festival \u2014 and eventually grew brave enough to send their reel (and an invoice for $50) to the comedian Bob Odenkirk, the co-creator of the influential sketch series \u201cMr. Show With Bob and David.\u201d\nMr. Odenkirk did not pay the enclosed bill, but he enjoyed Mr. Wareheim and Mr. Heidecker\u2019s shorts enough to become their mentor. \u201cMy first question to them was, \u2018What scene are you in?\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Odenkirk recalled in an interview. \u201cI thought maybe they knew everyone in New York and played their films in the clubs. And they were like, \u2018What are you talking about?\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n\u201cIt occurred to me,\u201d Mr. Odenkirk added, \u201cthat they aren\u2019t being influenced by anybody. They\u2019re in their own little world, and that\u2019s why they\u2019ve gotten good at this.\u201d\nWith Mr. Odenkirk\u2019s help, Mr. Heidecker and Mr. Wareheim found an agent and struck a deal with Adult Swim to produce an animated show, \u201cTom Goes to the Mayor,\u201d about a hapless inventor and the small-town politician who constantly ruins his plans. The cartoon was canceled after two seasons, but in their occasional live-action experiments for the series \u2014 fake advertisements and infomercials; a behind-the-scenes video podcast \u2014 the two men developed the funhouse-mirror sensibility that would eventually inform \u201cAwesome Show.\u201d\nOn \u201cAwesome Show\u201d (which made its debut with a 10-episode season in February 2007) Mr. Wareheim and Mr. Heidecker sometimes appear as themselves, but more often they play various grotesque characters: a tacky, overly affectionate husband-and-wife team of television news anchors; a facially disfigured singer and his garishly attired brother. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing less funny than someone who looks cool,\u201d Mr. Wareheim explained. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more unappealing.\u201d\nTo populate their twisted universe they frequently cast average-looking actors (and nonactors) recruited from Web sites like Craigslist, who bring an additional layer of deliberate amateurishness to their skits. The roster of real-life characters on \u201cAwesome Show\u201d now includes David Liebe Hart, a puppeteer and public-access television host, and James Quall, an aspiring comedian who specializes in inadvertently terrible voice impressions.\n\u201cWe know that it\u2019s not good,\u201d Mr. Heidecker said. \u201cWe\u2019re not idiots. But to James Quall he\u2019s doing a great job. And he\u2019s on TV. So everybody kind of wins.\u201d\nAuthentically famous people can also appear on \u201cAwesome Show,\u201d as long as they fit into the producers\u2019 skewed notion of fame and are willing to poke fun at themselves. The actor Tom Skerritt has been featured in a skit in which Mr. Heidecker and Mr. Wareheim hope to revitalize his career by composing an idiotic jingle for him. And John C. Reilly, the Oscar-nominated star of \u201cChicago\u201d and \u201cBoogie Nights,\u201d frequently appears as the wild-haired Dr. Steve Brule, a self-styled health and fitness expert who knows alarmingly little about the subjects.\nThe Brule character has proved so popular that he is being given his own six-episode spin-off show, tentatively titled \u201cCheck It Out!,\u201d starring Mr. Reilly and produced by Mr. Wareheim and Mr. Heidecker. \u201cSo much happens in a day of him improvising and us throwing stuff at him that you want to use it all,\u201d Mr. Heidecker said of Mr. Reilly.\nMr. Wareheim and Mr. Heidecker are also developing a game show for Adult Swim that would star  the comedian Neil Hamburger. Mr. Wareheim described it as \u201ca mixture of a Japanese bizarre game show and \u2018The Price Is Right.\u2019\u00a0\u201d And like everyone in Hollywood they would eventually like to make feature films. (\u201cWe\u2019d like our first movie to be a pretty pure Tim and Eric vision,\u201d Mr. Wareheim said, \u201cbefore we get sucked into the Apatow system.\u201d)\nOn the Web the duo can be seen with the comedian Zach Galifianakis in a series of viral videos promoting Absolut Vodka,  not to be confused with the satirical videos Mr. Wareheim and Mr. Heidecker made last summer, in which they appeared, without irony or fright makeup, to promote the release of \u201cShrek the Third.\u201d\n\u201cPeople really thought we got paid by DreamWorks to do that,\u201d Mr. Heidecker said. \u201cWe lost some fans that way. \u2018We thought you guys were cool, but you sold out.\u2019\u00a0\u201d", "date": "JULY 27, 2008", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/27/arts/television/27itzk.html", "tags": "brains tv show \u201d heidecker wareheim appear bizarre nightmare like awesome"}
