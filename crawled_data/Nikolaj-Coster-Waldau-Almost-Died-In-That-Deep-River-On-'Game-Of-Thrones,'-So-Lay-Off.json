{"title": "Nikolaj Coster-Waldau Almost Died In That Deep River On 'Game Of Thrones,' So Lay Off", "content": "Warning! Spoilers for \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d are coming!\u00a0\nThe fourth episode of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d Season 7, titled \u201cThe Spoils of War,\u201d was epic beyond proportions. It featured an impromptu battle, a fire-breathing dragon, a Dany-Jaime face-off, and an oddly deep river.\u00a0\nThat oddly deep river was probably the one thing that threw fans for a loop, and they just couldn\u2019t get over it.\u00a0\nAs Jaime (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) is, stupidly, charging at Dany (Emilia Clarke) and Drogon with a spear during the Loot Train battle, the dragon, obviously, spits fire at him before he\u2019s tackled into the water by Bronn (Jerome Flynn) just in the knick of time. The thing is, the water, which appeared to be a shallow pool, ended up being much deeper than one could imagine.\u00a0\nFans, of course, freaked out and wanted an explanation.\u00a0\nWell, get ready, because Jaime himself has an answer for you. Kind of.\u00a0\n\u201cI didn\u2019t see that hole, but there was a hole ... that could happen, I\u2019ve been told,\u201d Nikolaj Coster-Waldau joked to HuffPost on Build Series Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s very realistic.\u201d\nCoster-Waldau says that the only reason Jaime survived the incident, in fact, is because Bronn is an expert swimmer.\n\u201cWhat you didn\u2019t know, and I think Bronn should have [said], he was for years working on the beaches outside King\u2019s Landing as a lifeguard,\u201d Coster-Waldau deadpanned. \u201cHe was like an expert swimmer and he won the Westeros 1000 meter. So he\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d\u00a0\nIn actuality, filming the scene was a very strenuous and scary experience for Coster-Waldau. The actor said the abyss was \u201ca deep dark pool in Belfast,\u201d in which he freaked out during shooting due to fear.\u00a0\n\u201cAs you know, [Jaime]\u00a0falls into the water and he sinks, and we shot for a whole day and it was 15 feet I had to float down,\u201d he explained. \u201cI\u2019m going down and it\u2019s all murky water, you can\u2019t see anything, and in a situation like that you want to know, \u2018Well, I can get out of this.\u2019 But that day, I just couldn\u2019t ... it triggered all my claustrophobia.\u201d\n\u201cI was never in danger,\u201d he added, \u201cit was just a mental thing.\u201d\u00a0\nThe episode\u2019s director of photography, Robert McLachlan, spoke to HuffPost\u00a0about the safety team on set during production, saying,\u00a0\u201cI think one stuntman took an unexpected tumble off a horse, but he handled it really well and got right back on. But apart from that, no, as far as I know, even though it was a potentially really dangerous scene to film.\u201d\n\u201cSafety was paramount, I have to say,\u201d Coster-Waldau reassured us.\n\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d airs Sundays at 9 p.m. ET on HBO.
