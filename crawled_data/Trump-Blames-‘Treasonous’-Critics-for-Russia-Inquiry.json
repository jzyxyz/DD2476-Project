{"title": "Trump Blames \u2018Treasonous\u2019 Critics for Russia Inquiry", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump went on the offensive on Monday a day after the special counsel investigation reported no conspiracy with Russia, suggesting that critics who pursued such suspicions were \u201ctreasonous,\u201d guilty of \u201cevil things\u201d and should be investigated themselves.\nGrim faced and simmering with anger, Mr. Trump repeated his assertion that a collection of partisan foes had effectively conspired to try to disrupt or even end his presidency with false allegations about his campaign\u2019s ties with Moscow in 2016.\n\u201cThere are a lot of people out there that have done some very, very evil things, some bad things, I would say some treasonous things against our country,\u201d he told reporters during an Oval Office meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. \u201cAnd hopefully people that have done such harm to our country \u2014 we\u2019ve gone through a period of really bad things happening \u2014 those people will certainly be looked at.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been looking at them for a long time,\u201d he added, \u201cand I\u2019m saying why haven\u2019t they been looked at? They lied to Congress, many of them, you know who they are. They\u2019ve done so many evil things.\u201d\nThe president\u2019s comments expanded on the theme he expressed on Sunday after the Justice Department reported that the special counsel investigation by Robert S. Mueller III had wrapped up without finding a criminal scheme to influence the presidential election in tandem with Russia\u2019s government. With the Mueller inquiry behind him, Mr. Trump seems intent on turning the tables on his foes.\nMr. Trump took a softer line toward Mr. Mueller himself. Asked at an earlier appearance with Mr. Netanyahu on Monday whether Mr. Mueller had acted honorably, Mr. Trump said, \u201cYes, he did. Yes, he did.\u201d\nMr. Trump indicated that he would support releasing the full report by Mr. Mueller, as demanded by congressional Democrats. \u201cUp to the attorney general,\u201d he said. \u201cWouldn\u2019t bother me at all.\u201d\nBut he brushed off a question about whether he was considering pardons of any of the associates who were convicted or pleaded guilty during Mr. Mueller\u2019s inquiry. \u201cHaven\u2019t thought about it,\u201d he said.", "date": "March 25, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/25/us/politics/trump-russia.html", "tags": "things \u2018 mr. treasonous inquiry blames trump critics evil russia done \u2014 mueller"}
