{"title": "Review: \u2018Elektra\u2019 Runs Wild, With Ann Liv Young", "content": "It\u2019s hard to imagine Ann Liv Young and company doing what they did on Wednesday night more than once, let alone eight times, the length of their run at New York Live Arts in Chelsea. The brutal rawness and immediacy that we\u2019ve come to expect from Ms. Young, a divisive performer and choreographer, reaches new heights \u2014 or newly disturbing depths \u2014 in her \u201cElektra,\u201d which had its United States premiere alongside its even rowdier companion piece, \u201cElektra Cabaret.\u201d\nIn terms of audience interaction \u2014 which can be violently direct in Ms. Young\u2019s work \u2014 \u201cElektra,\u201d a very liberal interpretation of Sophocles, is fairly benign. The four main characters, in fact, are penned in, their singing and screaming and dancing confined to a sand pit encircled by a low fence, which seems built as much for them as for the show\u2019s four-legged interloper, a frisky black pig named Daisy.\nWhat\u2019s alarming here is just how much Ms. Young demands of herself, as Elektra, and of her performers: Bailey Catherine Nolan as Chrysothemis (Elektra\u2019s sister), Charley Parden as Orestes (their brother) and Vanessa Soudan as Clytemnestra (their mother). Daisy, treated to a steady stream of snacks by a lurking pig handler, Marissa Mickelberg, has it relatively easy.\nIn this fractured pop-song-driven tale of the siblings who avenge their father by killing his murderer \u2014 their mother \u2014 everyone fights, bites, flings, stabs and claws through scene after bitter scene, as if for the first and last time. Costumes rip (and fall off entirely); makeup smears; wigs and microphones come undone. When Elektra and Clytemnestra wrestle each other over a loaf of bread, you fear for them.\nEven tongue-in-cheek unison dances, polished to a degree rare for the chaos-loving Ms. Young, have a grim edge, owing partly to Lauren Libretti\u2019s exquisite yellow-gray lighting, a heavy presence that doesn\u2019t lift until the final murderous tableaus.\nPresented back-to-back with \u201cElektra Cabaret\u201d \u2014 with an interlude featuring Nessa Norich as a kind of sexual mystic, and Daniel Borg as her streamer-swirling partner \u2014 \u201cElektra\u201d offers just one version of Clytemnestra\u2019s demise. Hereditary entanglements are even more twisted in the karaoke-based cabaret, which ruptures the fourth wall (if you sit in the front row, prepare to be twerked upon) and introduces a real parent-child relationship, as Ms. Young\u2019s 8-year-old daughter, Lovey Ailish Guerrero, joins the denim-clad posse onstage. When she and Ms. Young belt out Eminem\u2019s \u201cThe Monster,\u201d side by side, they could be sisters.", "date": "Jan. 22, 2016", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/23/arts/dance/review-elektra-runs-wild-with-ann-liv-young.html", "tags": "liv \u2018 young ann clytemnestra come even wild new elektra \u201d \u2014 ms. review runs"}
