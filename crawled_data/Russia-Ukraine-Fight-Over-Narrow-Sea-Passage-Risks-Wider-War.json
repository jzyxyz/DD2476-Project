{"title": "Russia-Ukraine Fight Over Narrow Sea Passage Risks Wider War", "content": "MOSCOW \u2014 Ukraine\u2019s president put his nation on a war footing with Russia on Monday, as tensions over a shared waterway escalated into a crisis that dragged in NATO and the United Nations.\nRussia\u2019s seizure a day earlier of three small Ukrainian naval vessels and 23 sailors \u2014 including at least three wounded in a shooting by the Russian side \u2014 was the first overt armed conflict between the two sides since the beginning days of the conflict in 2014, when Russian special forces occupied Crimea.\nThe opening of an additional front at sea, even if Ukraine lacks a real navy, introduced an unstable element into what had been a shadowy war. The conflict pitting Ukrainian soldiers against Russian-backed separatists in the breakaway Donbas region, in eastern Ukraine, has sputtered along for almost five years with more than 10,000 people killed.\nThe Kremlin, along with some Ukrainian opposition figures, called the martial drumbeats echoing from Kiev a domestic political ploy by its embattled president, Petro O. Poroshenko. They accused him of fearmongering in order to delay or at least reconfigure the March 31 election that he had seemed certain to lose.\nMr. Poroshenko delivered a speech to Ukraine\u2019s Parliament asking it to approve the declaration of martial law starting on Wednesday, with the military already on full alert. The attack on the naval vessels near the shared waterway, the Kerch Strait, represented a new stage of aggression in what he called Russia\u2019s \u201chybrid war\u201d against Ukraine.\n\u201cThis is a bold and frank participation of the regular units of the Russian Federation, their demonstrative attack on the detachment of the Ukrainian Armed Forces,\u201d Mr. Poroshenko said. \u201cThis is a qualitatively different situation, a qualitatively different threat.\u201d\nMembers of 450-member Verkhovna Rada, the Parliament, who were present voted overwhelmingly to support the measure \u2014 276 to 30 \u2014 after the president agreed to dilute its scope.\nUkraine also received a boost from the international reaction, underscoring both the isolation of Russia from the West over the Ukraine conflict, and the desire to protect the international maritime convention that allows for unimpeded shipping through any strait.\n\u201cWhat you saw yesterday was very serious, because you saw actually that Russia used military force in an open way,\u201d said NATO\u2019s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, during a news conference in Brussels following a meeting requested by Ukraine. \u201cThis is escalating the situation in the region and confirms a pattern of behavior which we have seen over several years.\u201d\nNATO was increasing its military presence in the area, he said, calling on Russia to allow freedom of navigation for Ukrainian ships in the Kerch Strait.\nAt the United Nations, Russia called a session of the Security Council in an attempt to force a discussion about what it called Ukrainian violations of Russian territorial waters. But Western nations quickly turned the session into a long criticism of Russia for its actions against Ukraine since 2014.\n\u201cImpeding Ukraine\u2019s lawful transit through the Kerch Strait is a violation under international law. It is an arrogant act that the international community must condemn and will never accept,\u201d Ambassador Nikki R. Haley of the United States told the council.\n\u201cAs President Trump said many times, the United States would welcome a normal relationship with Russia, but outlaw actions like this one continue to make that impossible,\u201d she said.\nMr. Trump offered his own criticism \u2014 without specifically blaming Russia \u2014 when asked by reporters in Washington about the naval confrontation. \u201cNot good. We\u2019re not happy about it at all,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do not like what\u2019s happening either way.\u201d\nVarious European capitals also criticized Russia, calling for it to release the seized vessels and their crews. There were scattered calls for new sanctions against Russia.\nThe Russians seemed to try to tamp down the confrontation, moving an old cargo vessel anchored to block passage through the Kerch Strait, and allowing commercial traffic to resume.\nThe Kremlin remained largely silent for much of the day. It was left to Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov to address the issue, and his ministry accused Ukraine of creating threats to normal shipping traffic in the strait by violating international maritime law, and trying to foment a crisis for domestic political purposes.\nRussian political analysts suggested that the Kremlin had no need to ratchet up its confrontation with Ukraine \u2014 it had already achieved what it wanted by destabilizing the country through support for the separatists.\nWhile President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s flagging domestic support may benefit from a fight with Ukraine, that would be outweighed by the risk of greater Western sanctions. \u201cI do not see any benefits for the Kremlin from this confrontation,\u201d said Nikolai Petrov, an analyst and professor of political science.\nAsked about events during his daily briefing, Dmitri S. Peskov, Mr. Putin\u2019s spokesman, framed the Russian actions against the Ukrainian boats as an interception, not an attack.\n\u201cThe question here is of incursion into the territorial waters of the Russian Federation by foreign military vessels,\u201d Mr. Peskov said. \u201cThey entered the territorial waters of Russia without responding to any queries from our border guards, in no way responded to offers to make use of pilotage service, and so on and so forth.\u201d\nThe dispute over the waterway is fundamentally unresolvable because it hinges on different interpretations of who controls the territorial waters around the Crimean peninsula. Both sides tried to portray themselves as determined to protect the normal shipping that the other side was interfering with. Ukraine had previously sought and been granted permission for similar passages, according to official Russian accounts, but did not this time.\nBut Ukraine wants to assert its continued sovereignty in areas which Russia considers its own, analysts said. Controlling passage from the Black Sea through the Kerch Strait into the Sea of Azov is a key element in asserting Russia\u2019s broader claim to Crimea.\n\u201cMoscow clearly seeks to turn the Azov Sea into a Russian basin, and to use it to bring leverage to bear on Kiev,\u201d wrote Mark Galeotti, an expert on Russian intelligence services at the Institute of International Relations in Prague, on Twitter. \u201cIt wants to demonstrate its capacity to act without having to worry about external constraint.\u201d\nThe two sides signed an agreement in 2003 to guarantee free passage through the strait, but in recent months have been harassing each other\u2019s ships. The port of Mariupol and a couple of others are important for the Ukrainian economy for exports of steel and grain, as well as for imports.\nSteven Pifer, a former American ambassador to Ukraine, said that the Kremlin might be testing the level of support for Ukraine using the waterway. \u201cThey can very easily back off,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if they sense the reaction is weak, I think that they will continue the blockade.\u201d\nThis year Mr. Putin inaugurated a $7.5 billion bridge across the strait, meant not least to assert its claim to Crimea with a physical link.\nOne strategic aspect of the design shown by events on Sunday is that Russia could block the strait merely by anchoring a cargo ship in the one opening under the bridge \u2014 185 meters wide and 35 meters high \u2014 large enough to allow the passage of ships.\nPresident Poroshenko sought to portray events as part of a larger assault by Russia. During his speech to Parliament, he waved a sheaf of papers that he said detailed Ukraine\u2019s intelligence about Russian preparations for a ground offensive. That seemed unlikely, given the lack of any clear military objective, analysts said.\nThere was, however, a widespread sense among opposition figures and analysts that Mr. Poroshenko aimed to put off the March election, noting that he had not called for martial law during previous points in the conflict when the fighting was far worse.\nMr. Poroshenko tried to assuage that criticism by cutting the period of martial law from two months to one, so it would not interfere with the official start of the campaign season on Dec. 31.\nOther compromises mean that the martial law declaration will only affect the 10 provinces bordering Russia or Transnistria, a breakaway province of neighboring Moldova, also controlled by Russian-backed forces.\nThe president also promised that martial law would not be used to curb civil liberties or to announce a general military mobilization, and that it would only be enforced in the case of new attacks. Still, the very prospect of martial law could help boost support for him as a wartime leader.\nOleg Kashin, a Russian columnist and political analyst, wrote in the online publication Republic that the expansion of the shooting into the Sea of Azov seemed more like an extension of the endless skirmishing in eastern Ukraine than the start of any full-fledged war.\n\u201cThe Sea of Azov is the most convenient space for the most spectacular political wrestling,\u201d he wrote, calling it a \u201ctiny reservoir\u201d that nobody had ever considered a real sea.\nHe wrote that the sea belongs \u201conly to Russia and Ukraine, and no third-party interests will be affected, even if tomorrow the entire surface of the Sea of Azov goes up in flames.\u201d", "date": "Nov. 26, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/26/world/europe/russia-ukraine-kerch-strait.html", "tags": "ukraine wider passage risks russian strait fight \u201d war russia sea ukrainian narrow russia-ukraine \u2014"}
