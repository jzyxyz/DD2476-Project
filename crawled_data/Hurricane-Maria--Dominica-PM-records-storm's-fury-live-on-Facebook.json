{"title": "Hurricane Maria: Dominica PM records storm's fury live on Facebook", "content": "The fury with which Hurricane Maria tore into the Caribbean island of Dominica was revealed in a series of Facebook posts by its Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit.\nAs the core of the category five storm slammed into the island with sustained winds of 260km/h (160mph), Mr Skerrit described its impact on those hunkering down.\nOne meteorologist said Dominica was being \"obliterated\". Mr Skerrit could clearly feel the force of the storm. \nThen, as the winds tore the roof from the building, the PM seemed to think all might be lost. \nBut it appears help was at hand.  \nMr Skerrit later posted a statement on Facebook describing \"widespread devastation\" with winds having swept away the roofs of \"almost every person I have spoken to or otherwise made contact with\".  \nHe said that news of serious injury and possible death resulting from landslides triggered by persistent rainfall was \"my greatest fear\". \nMr Skerrit said that his focus was now on rescuing those trapped and providing medical assistance to the injured. \n\"We will need help, my friend, we will need help of all kinds,\" he added. \nThe eye of Hurricane Maria, which strengthened to a category five storm before making landfall on the Caribbean island, is moving roughly along the same track as Irma, the hurricane that devastated the region earlier this month.", "date": "19 September 2017", "href": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-41316199", "tags": "maria live island hurricane winds skerrit storm facebook records help tore pm dominica fury"}
