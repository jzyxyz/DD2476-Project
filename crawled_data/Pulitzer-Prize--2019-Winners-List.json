Chiu of Associated Press; Staff of Associated Press\nFEATURE PHOTOGRAPHY\nSome of the pictures Lorenzo Tugnoli, 39, has taken in Yemen could be from anywhere: a young girl having her height measured, veiled women in a classroom.

Walker of The Boston Globe; Maggie Steber and Lynn Johnson of National Geographic\nFICTION\nMr. Powers, 61, is known as a brainy novelist, but \u201cThe Overstory\u201d tested even his intellectual capacity: Its central characters are trees.
