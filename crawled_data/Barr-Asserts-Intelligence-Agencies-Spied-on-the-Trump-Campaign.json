{"title": "Barr Asserts Intelligence Agencies Spied on the Trump Campaign", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Attorney General William P. Barr said on Wednesday that he would scrutinize the F.B.I.\u2019s investigation of the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia, including whether \u201cspying\u201d conducted by American intelligence agencies on the campaign\u2019s associates had been properly carried out.\n\u201cI think spying on a political campaign is a big deal,\u201d Mr. Barr said during testimony before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee, adding that he wanted to look into both \u201cthe genesis and the conduct\u201d of the F.B.I. inquiry. He cast his interest as a matter of protecting civil liberties from potential abuse by the government.\n\u201cI think spying did occur,\u201d Mr. Barr said. \u201cThe question is whether it was adequately predicated. And I\u2019m not suggesting that it wasn\u2019t adequately predicated. But I need to explore that.\u201d\nThe remarks by the new attorney general \u2014 particularly his embrace of the term spying, which is frequently invoked by critics of the Russia investigation \u2014 are certain to please President Trump and his allies, who have accused American law enforcement officials of targeting his campaign out of political malice.\nMr. Barr\u2019s pledge, made as he prepares to make public in coming days a redacted version of the special counsel\u2019s report on the Russia inquiry, was a sign that after nearly three years of investigating the president\u2019s campaign and Russia, the Justice Department\u2019s focus may begin to shift in a direction that Mr. Trump has demanded.\nIn addition to Mr. Barr\u2019s review of the F.B.I. investigation, the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general, a specially tasked United States attorney and Republicans in Congress are all studying key actions taken during the course of the inquiry. Those actions include how officials opened the Trump-Russia investigation, called Crossfire Hurricane, and obtained a secret warrant to wiretap a former Trump campaign adviser.\nMr. Trump\u2019s thirst for a reckoning among his inquisitors appears to have only grown in recent weeks. Minutes before Mr. Barr took the witness stand on Wednesday, the president called the investigation an \u201cattempted coup\u201d and claimed, again, that he had been \u201ctotally exonerated\u201d by the report, despite the fact that Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel who took over the F.B.I.\u2019s Russia investigation in 2017, explicitly said he could not clear the president of trying to obstruct justice.\n\u201cIt was an illegal investigation,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters as he left the White House for a trip to Texas. In some of his harshest criticism of the investigation to date, Mr. Trump said: \u201cEverything about it was crooked \u2014 every single thing about it. There were dirty cops. These were bad people.\u201d\n\u201cThis was an attempted takedown of a president,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd we beat them. We beat them.\u201d\nMr. Mueller delivered his nearly 400 pages of findings to Mr. Barr late last month. Much of Wednesday\u2019s hearing, and an earlier session with House lawmakers on Tuesday, was focused on that report, on continuing redactions of delicate information before it becomes public, and on Mr. Barr\u2019s characterization of what Mr. Mueller found.\nMr. Barr, who said that he hoped to make a redacted version of Mr. Mueller\u2019s report public next week, used more measured tones in describing the review he intended to oversee than Mr. Trump did. The attorney general also signaled that he would wait to hear from others already at work, including the inspector general who could deliver a report in May or June, before replicating their review.\nHe said he was not starting an investigation into the F.B.I. or any other law enforcement agency, per se, but he did allude to several of the bureau\u2019s former leaders who oversaw the opening of the Russia inquiry.\n\u201cTo the extent there were any issues at the F.B.I., I do not view it as a problem that is endemic to the F.B.I.,\u201d Mr. Barr said. \u201cI think there was probably failure among a group of leaders there at the upper echelon.\u201d\nMr. Barr did not present evidence to back up his statement, and he declined to share details about which investigative actions concerned him.\nThe F.B.I. obtained a secret surveillance warrant to spy on one former Trump aide, Carter Page, after he left the campaign. Republicans in Congress have questioned the legality of that warrant because it used unverified Democrat-funded opposition research compiled into a dossier by Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence officer. But a judge approved it, and it was not clear whether any laws were broken.\nBoth Dana Boente, now the F.B.I. general counsel, and Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, signed the FISA renewal application on Mr. Page.\nThe bureau sought the wiretap on Mr. Page because of his previous contacts with a Russian intelligence officer in 2013 and material in the dossier. Among claims that Mr. Steele compiled from sources was that during a visit to Moscow in July 2016, Mr. Page secretly met a Russian official promising compromising information about Hillary Clinton \u2014 an accusation that Mr. Page has denied.\nThe F.B.I. also used a confidential informant to collect information on Trump campaign associates, which prompted more accusations of spying by the president.\nMr. Trump or people close to him have leveled charges that have not borne out, including that President Barack Obama had ordered wiretaps on Trump Tower in Manhattan.\nDefenders of the F.B.I. have objected to the notion that it spied on the Trump campaign. The F.B.I. and Justice Department, they say, waited to seek a court order permitting it to wiretap Mr. Page until after he left the campaign and was on the verge of returning to Russia.\nStill, the wiretap order enabled F.B.I. agents to obtain and read older emails in Mr. Page\u2019s account, including when he was working with the campaign. The inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, has asked those involved in that effort why they did not use a so-called filter team to review the messages and screen out any sensitive but irrelevant information before adding them to the Russia investigation case file. However, there appeared to be no rule requiring such a step, according to a person familiar with the inquiry.\nThe inspector general has also asked about the handling of F.B.I. informants, including Mr. Steele and Stefan A. Halper, an American academic who teaches in Britain.\nAfter the F.B.I. opened the Russia investigation in late July 2016, agents asked Mr. Halper to gather information on Mr. Page and George Papadopoulos, another former Trump campaign adviser.\nMr. Halper had also spoken to Mr. Page at a symposium that month, which has raised suspicions by critics of the F.B.I. that the investigation started earlier than the bureau has said. But that earlier encounter was a coincidence, according to a former federal law enforcement official.\nMr. Barr appeared to be responding generally to those episodes, many of which have been the subject of news reports.\n\u201cI feel I have an obligation to make sure that government power is not abused,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that is one of the principal roles of the attorney general.\u201d\nDemocrats involved in Congress\u2019s investigations of Russia\u2019s election interference quickly chastised Mr. Barr for using the term spying in a way that they believe feeds a right-wing conspiracy of F.B.I. wrongdoing.\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi of California said it appeared he was \u201cgoing off the rails\u201d to protect Mr. Trump.\nSenator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, accused Mr. Barr of giving \u201ca wink and a nod\u201d to a \u201clong-debunked \u2018spying\u2019 conspiracy.\u201d\nAnd at one point, Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, pressed Mr. Barr on whether he had \u201cspecific evidence of anything improper in the counterintelligence investigation.\u201d Mr. Barr said he did not.\n\u201cI have no specific evidence that I would cite right now,\u201d he said. \u201cI do have questions about it.\u201d\nBut when Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii, asked Mr. Barr if he had intended to use the term spying \u2014 a term the senator said might \u201ccause everybody in the cable news ecosystem to freak out\u201d \u2014 Mr. Barr rephrased his statement.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure of all of the connotations of that word that you\u2019re referring to,\u201d the attorney general said, then he added, \u201cI want to make sure there was no unauthorized surveillance.\u201d\nMr. Barr, who began his career at the C.I.A., did not intend to imply that spying was inherently wrong, according to a person who has discussed the matter with him but was not authorized to share their conversation. Mr. Barr sees no technical difference between that term and surveillance. He indicated that at issue was not the act of surveilling but whether officials followed proper procedures when they decided to gather intelligence on Trump\u2019s associates in 2016.\nSenator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, elicited a response from Mr. Barr that invoked another era. When she asked why Mr. Barr was going to review the origins of the Russia investigation, he answered that \u201cthe generation I grew up in, which is the Vietnam War period, you know, people were all concerned about spying on antiwar people and so forth by the government.\u201d", "date": "April 10, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/us/politics/barr-trump-campaign-spying.html", "tags": "intelligence asserts f.b.i \u201c spied investigation trump agencies barr russia campaign said"}
