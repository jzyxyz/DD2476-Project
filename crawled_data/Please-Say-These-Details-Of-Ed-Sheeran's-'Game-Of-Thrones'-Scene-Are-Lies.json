{"title": "Please Say These Details Of Ed Sheeran's 'Game Of Thrones' Scene Are Lies", "content": "After hearing\u00a0Ed Sheeran was going to be on \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d Season 7, we thought maybe we found love right where we are.\nBut it seems like that was not meant to be.\nNews of Sheeran\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d appearance was announced at South by Southwest earlier this year. The \u201cGoT\u201d\u00a0showrunners had apparently been trying to get the singer on the show for a while because Maisie Williams, who plays Arya, is a big fan.\nNow, Sheeran has reportedly shared details.\u00a0\nAccording to various outlets, such as\u00a0ScreenCrush\u00a0and Watchers on the Wall, Sheeran told The Hits Radio:\nArya serious, dude?\nIf that happens, disappointment is coming.\nThat dialogue alone seems completely out of character for Arya. She\u2019s got other things to worry about besides \u201cnice\u201d songs from likable British blokes.\nOne of the best parts of Season 6 was Arya seemingly reaching her final form as a revenge-thirsty assassin. The last time we saw her, she was serving Walder Frey pieces of his family in a pie. It doesn\u2019t get more hardcore than that!\nBut now,\u00a0she\u2019s taking breaks to compliment Ed Sheeran?\u00a0\n(Growing up is complicated.)\nOur only guess is that Arya must be saying, \u201cOh, that\u2019s a nice song,\u201d in a sinister way, like she\u2019s Bane from \u201cThe Dark Knight Rises.\u201d\nA\u00a0supposed Season 7 leak\u00a0claims Arya would be killing more Freys. If that\u2019s the case, perhaps she does it Red Wedding-style and the song Sheeran plays will let the Freys know shiz is about to go down.\nAfter she finishes the Freys off, Arya will say,\u00a0\u201cOh, that\u2019s a nice song,\u201d and walk away in slow-motion. Explosions will then go off behind her.\nThat\u2019d be sick.\nIf it doesn\u2019t happen that way, Sheeran must just play \u201cCastle on the Hill\u201d or something.\u00a0\nYou can\u2019t blame Arya too much. That is a nice song.\n\u201dGame of Thrones\u201d Season 7 premieres July 16.", "date": "\n05/01/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ed-sheerans-game-of-thrones-scene_n_5907301fe4b0bb2d086f9a73", "tags": "song game \u201c details sheeran scene season please nice ed say lies arya freys thrones"}
