{"title": "Taylor Swift Begins Her \u2018Reputation\u2019 Tour, Taking on Foes and Her Old Self", "content": "GLENDALE, Ariz. \u2014 About halfway through Taylor Swift\u2019s concert at the University of Phoenix Stadium here Tuesday night, as she was performing \u201cShake It Off\u201d on one of the smaller stages near the center of the field, a pair of giant inflatable snakes rose up from the floor. While she sang tart kiss-offs, they bobbed around not quite menacingly.\nThere were, throughout the night \u2014 the opening engagement of her \u201cReputation\u201d stadium tour \u2014 quite a few snakes. During the unusually melancholic love song \u201cKing of My Heart,\u201d they were onscreen, thickly interwoven. Early in the show, they festooned a platform at center stage. One of the conveyances she used to move through the sky from one side of the stadium to the other was snake-shaped. She sang the bubbly mean-girl anthem \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d while clutching a snake-gripped microphone. At the merchandise stands, olive-green T-shirts with snakes on the front pocket were $50.\nSince the release of \u201cReputation\u201d in November, the snake has become Ms. Swift\u2019s spirit animal, but also the symbol that\u2019s gotten in the way of her spirit. She claimed it for herself after Kim Kardashian deployed it against her in 2016, at the height of the tensions between Ms. Swift and Ms. Kardashian\u2019s husband, Kanye West. Ms. Kardashian depicted Ms. Swift as duplicitous, and it stuck.\nIn Ms. Swift\u2019s mind, that is. Her commitment to the bit is intense, and a little quixotic. Late in the show, she addressed the snakes in the room, telling the audience that the feud had led her to \u201csome really low times\u201d but that she\u2019d emerged stronger than she\u2019d entered.\n[Never miss a pop music story: Sign up for our weekly newsletter, Louder.]\nThat was the version of herself that she performed here \u2014 resilient, ferocious, chilly. But for Ms. Swift, 28, who over the past decade-plus has been among the warmest of pop superstars, playing an ice queen, a pain princess, a steel warrior isn\u2019t a totally natural fit.\nAnd so this concert was in places \u2014 though not that many \u2014 a tug of war between new Taylor (n\u00fc-Taylor?) and old. If Ms. Kardashian had sought to redefine the public narrative about Ms. Swift, Ms. Swift finished the job, largely throttling her old self in favor of something a little more bulletproof.\nOver more than two hours, she performed with a kind of industrial intensity and gothic overtones. Songs like \u201c \u2026 Ready for It?,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t Blame Me\u201d and \u201cEnd Game\u201d were practically bruising. Her outfits were dark, shimmery and imperial. Sometimes she would break the moment with a quick smile, but mostly she stayed on task.\nIt made for a show that was full of drama, but not always dramatic, and by and large denuded of the things Ms. Swift excels at. She is most expressive with her face, achieving intimacy with just a few gestures. At this scale, that can be challenging. She is not a particularly comfortable dancer, but this performance kept demanding movement.\nThere were moments when leaning in to the acrimony of recent years proved effective. During \u201cLook What You Made Me Do,\u201d with its barb aimed at Mr. West about his \u201ctilted stage\u201d (from his \u201cSaint Pablo\u201d tour), dancers tangled with a medium-size platform that tilted from side to side. The song\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m sorry, the old Taylor can\u2019t come to the phone right now\u201d aside was delivered, via video, by Tiffany Haddish.\nThough the dominant mood of the presentation was confrontational and stern \u2014 even the dancers were generally dressed for war \u2014 the prevailing mood of the music was something softer (especially early in the night, when Ms. Swift strung together several dreamy-eyed songs in a row: \u201cGorgeous,\u201d \u201cStyle,\u201d \u201cLove Story,\u201d \u201cYou Belong With Me\u201d).\nThis is a similar tension as the one at work on \u201cReputation\u201d \u2014 a great album, but maybe not a great Taylor Swift album. It marks her full embrace of contemporary pop aesthetics following her slow, deliberate march from teenage country stardom. It has been certified triple platinum, but it is her least commercially successful album, and the one with the fewest indelible hits. Ms. Swift\u2019s charms are micro, and they\u2019re sometimes obscured by the album\u2019s macro aesthetic rewiring.\n\u201cReputation\u201d is about lashing out against your antagonists, sure, but also about seeking, and perhaps finding, love in the midst of severe self-doubt. In the moments here where she gave in to that feeling \u2014 like \u201cNew Year\u2019s Day,\u201d which she sang from behind a piano, and \u201cDelicate,\u201d which she delivered alone onstage, while the beat thumped out into the ether, heartbeat-like \u2014 she shined. And when she revisited the wistful \u201cAll Too Well,\u201d from the 2012 album \u201cRed,\u201d she was spirited but calm. (\u201cLong Live,\u201d from the 2010 album \u201cSpeak Now,\u201d was far less successful.)\nSo it was confusing that Ms. Swift chose a third path to conclude the show: petulance. First came \u201cWe Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,\u201d an exuberant hit from \u201cRed\u201d that shows her at her best, wagging her finger while taking the emotional high road. But that song collided with \u201cThis Is Why We Can\u2019t Have Nice Things,\u201d one of the cheekier songs on \u201cReputation,\u201d in which the finger-wagging (aimed at Mr. West) comes with the ostensible moral high road (though it feels slightly hollow given Mr. West\u2019s challenging last couple of weeks). At one point, everyone onstage was giggling conspiratorially. Some of the dancers \u2014 and Ms. Swift as well \u2014 were wet from the onstage fountain. It was mean, merry and loose. After a heavily armored performance, maybe it indicated that she was finally ready to shed that pesky thick skin.", "date": "May 9, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/09/arts/music/taylor-swift-reputation-tour-review.html", "tags": "foes \u2018 taking tour album \u201d taylor begins one snakes reputation old self ms. \u2014 swift"}
