Only one year, 2011, had cooler than average temperatures.\nIt also reiterated that the Great Barrier Reef had suffered consecutive years of mass bleaching due to elevated ocean temperatures.\nClimate change caused by human activity had contributed to the annual mean temperature increasing by about 1.1C since 1910, the report said.\nOn Sunday, Sydney experienced its hottest day in 79 years when temperatures hit 47.3C. A previous study has warned Australia's biggest cities could face 50C temperatures by 2040.", "date": "10 January 2018", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-42630056", "tags": "australia experienced report record temperatures hottest year years bureau annual third-warmest"}
