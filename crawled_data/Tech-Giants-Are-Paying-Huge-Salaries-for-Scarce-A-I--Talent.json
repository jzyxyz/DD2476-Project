{"title": "Tech Giants Are Paying Huge Salaries for Scarce A.I. Talent", "content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Silicon Valley\u2019s start-ups have always had a recruiting advantage over the industry\u2019s giants: Take a chance on us and we\u2019ll give you an ownership stake that could make you rich if the company is successful.\nNow the tech industry\u2019s race to embrace artificial intelligence may render that advantage moot \u2014 at least for the few prospective employees who know a lot about A.I.\nTech\u2019s biggest companies are placing huge bets on artificial intelligence, banking on things ranging from face-scanning smartphones and conversational coffee-table gadgets to computerized health care and autonomous vehicles. As they chase this future, they are doling out salaries that are startling even in an industry that has never been shy about lavishing a fortune on its top talent.\nTypical A.I. specialists, including both Ph.D.s fresh out of school and people with less education and just a few years of experience, can be paid from $300,000 to $500,000 a year or more in salary and company stock, according to nine people who work for major tech companies or have entertained job offers from them. All of them requested anonymity because they did not want to damage their professional prospects.\nWell-known names in the A.I. field have received compensation in salary and shares in a company\u2019s stock that total single- or double-digit millions over a four- or five-year period. And at some point they renew or negotiate a new contract, much like a professional athlete.\nAt the top end are executives with experience managing A.I. projects. In a court filing this year, Google revealed that one of the leaders of its self-driving-car division, Anthony Levandowski, a longtime employee who started with Google in 2007, took home over $120 million in incentives before joining Uber last year through the acquisition of a start-up he had co-founded that drew the two companies into a court fight over intellectual property.\nSalaries are spiraling so fast that some joke the tech industry needs a National Football League-style salary cap on A.I. specialists. \u201cThat would make things easier,\u201d said Christopher Fernandez, one of Microsoft\u2019s hiring managers. \u201cA lot easier.\u201d\nThere are a few catalysts for the huge salaries. The auto industry is competing with Silicon Valley for the same experts who can help build self-driving cars. Giant tech companies like Facebook and Google also have plenty of money to throw around and problems that they think A.I. can help solve, like building digital assistants for smartphones and home gadgets and spotting offensive content.\nMost of all, there is a shortage of talent, and the big companies are trying to land as much of it as they can. Solving tough A.I. problems is not like building the flavor-of-the-month smartphone app. In the entire world, fewer than 10,000 people have the skills necessary to tackle serious artificial intelligence research, according to Element AI, an independent lab in Montreal.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is not necessarily good for society, but it is rational behavior by these companies,\u201d said Andrew Moore, the dean of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University, who previously worked at Google. \u201cThey are anxious to ensure that they\u2019ve got this small cohort of people\u201d who can work on this technology.\nCosts at an A.I. lab called DeepMind, acquired by Google for a reported $650 million in 2014, when it employed about 50 people, illustrate the issue. Last year, according to the company\u2019s recently released annual financial accounts in Britain, the lab\u2019s \u201cstaff costs\u201d as it expanded to 400 employees totaled $138 million. That comes out to $345,000 an employee.\n\u201cIt is hard to compete with that, especially if you are one of the smaller companies,\u201d said Jessica Cataneo, an executive recruiter at the tech recruiting firm CyberCoders.\nThe cutting edge of artificial intelligence research is based on a set of mathematical techniques called deep neural networks. These networks are mathematical algorithms that can learn tasks on their own by analyzing data. By looking for patterns in millions of dog photos, for example, a neural network can learn to recognize a dog. This mathematical idea dates back to the 1950s, but it remained on the fringes of academia and industry until about five years ago.\nBy 2013, Google, Facebook and a few other companies started to recruit the relatively few researchers who specialized in these techniques. Neural networks now help recognize faces in photos posted to Facebook, identify commands spoken into living-room digital assistants like the Amazon Echo and instantly translate foreign languages on Microsoft\u2019s Skype phone service.\nUsing the same mathematical techniques, researchers are improving self-driving cars and developing hospital services that can identify illness and disease in medical scans, digital assistants that can not only recognize spoken words but understand them, automated stock-trading systems and robots that pick up objects they\u2019ve never seen before.\nWith so few A.I. specialists available, big tech companies are also hiring the best and brightest of academia. In the process, they are limiting the number of professors who can teach the technology.\nUber hired 40 people from Carnegie Mellon\u2019s groundbreaking A.I. program in 2015 to work on its self-driving-car project. Over the last several years, four of the best-known A.I. researchers in academia have left or taken leave from their professorships at Stanford University. At the University of Washington, six of 20 artificial intelligence professors are now on leave or partial leave and working for outside companies.\n\u201cThere is a giant sucking sound of academics going into industry,\u201d said Oren Etzioni, who is on leave from his position as a professor at the University of Washington to oversee the nonprofit Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence.\nSome professors are finding a way to compromise. Luke Zettlemoyer of the University of Washington turned down a position at a Google-run Seattle laboratory that he said would have paid him more than three times his current salary (about $180,000, according to public records). Instead, he chose a post at the Allen Institute that allowed him to continue teaching.\n\u201cThere are plenty of faculty that do this, splitting their time in various percentages between industry and academia,\u201d Mr. Zettlemoyer said. \u201cThe salaries are so much higher in industry, people only do this because they really care about being an academian.\u201d\nTo bring in new A.I. engineers, companies like Google and Facebook are running classes that aim to teach \u201cdeep learning\u201d and related techniques to existing employees. And nonprofits like Fast.ai and companies like Deeplearning.ai, founded by a former Stanford professor who helped create the Google Brain lab, offer online courses.\nThe basic concepts of deep learning are not hard to grasp, requiring little more than high-school-level math. But real expertise requires more significant math and an intuitive talent that some call \u201ca dark art.\u201d Specific knowledge is needed for fields like self-driving cars, robotics and health care.\nIn order to keep pace, smaller companies are looking for talent in unusual places. Some are hiring physicists and astronomers who have the necessary math skills. Other start-ups from the United States are looking for workers in Asia, Eastern Europe and other locations where wages are lower.\n\u201cI can\u2019t compete with Google, and I don\u2019t want to,\u201d said Chris Nicholson, the chief executive and a co-founder of Skymind, a start-up in San Francisco that has hired engineers in eight countries. \u201cSo I offer very attractive salaries in countries that undervalue engineering talent.\u201d\nBut the industry\u2019s giants are doing much the same. Google, Facebook, Microsoft and others have opened A.I. labs in Toronto and Montreal, where much of this research outside the United States is being done. Google also is hiring in China, where Microsoft has long had a strong presence.\nNot surprisingly, many think the talent shortage won\u2019t be alleviated for years.\n\u201cOf course demand outweighs supply. And things are not getting better any time soon,\u201d Yoshua Bengio, a professor at the University of Montreal and a prominent A.I. researcher, said. \u201cIt takes many years to train a Ph.D.\u201d", "date": "Oct. 22, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/22/technology/artificial-intelligence-experts-salaries.html", "tags": "google paying companies scarce tech talent \u201d salaries giants industry huge like a.i"}
