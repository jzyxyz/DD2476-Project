{"title": "Bush Loyalist Now Sees a White House Dangerously Soft on Iran and North Korea", "content": "WASHINGTON, Nov. 8 \u2014 The White House\u2019s effort to challenge Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions has been hobbled by \u201cfour and a half years of failed diplomacy.\u201d Its policy regarding North Korea is a dangerous fraud. It is pursuing an improbable Palestinian-Israeli peace at the expense of its stance against proliferation in the Middle East.\nAnd that from a longtime Bush loyalist: John R. Bolton, the conservative lawyer who until less than a year ago was President Bush\u2019s proudly unwavering ambassador to the United Nations.\nMr. Bolton, long viewed by liberal critics as a villain on the Bush team, has since emerged as the administration\u2019s most outspoken critic from the right, rebuking his former boss in interviews, in op-ed articles and now in a book. For a man who rushed to Florida in 2000 to join the Bush campaign\u2019s legal fight during the disputed vote recount, the disappointment sounds personal.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t spend 31 days in Florida,\u201d he said, \u201cto end up where we are now.\u201d\nMr. Bolton\u2019s criticisms reflect a growing unease among some conservatives that a weakened White House chastened by the war in Iraq is abandoning core principles in pursuit of a more moderate policy of negotiations.\n\u201cYou see this at the end of every administration,\u201d said Representative Peter Hoekstra, Republican of Michigan, who criticized the administration\u2019s talks with North Korea to dismantle its nuclear weapons program.\nWith Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, another staunchly conservative Republican, he recently wrote an op-ed article in The Wall Street Journal, calling on the administration to disclose information about a reported Israeli airstrike in September against a site in Syria that was suspected of being a nuclear facility that North Korea was equipping.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to watch very carefully what they do in North Korea,\u201d Mr. Hoekstra said in a telephone interview. \u201cI\u2019m going to watch what they do with the Israelis and the Palestinians and the Syrians.\u201d\nMr. Bush\u2019s turn to a more pragmatic policy coincided with the departure of some of the administration\u2019s most hawkish officials and the ascendancy of Condoleezza Rice as secretary of state. Now, some of the debates that once occurred behind the administration\u2019s closed doors are taking place in public. \u201cI thought the policy had been moving in the wrong direction for quite some time,\u201d Mr. Bolton said of his decision to leave when his recess appointment expired with the last Congress at the end of December.  (The White House discussed keeping him on, though it was clear that the Senate would never confirm him as ambassador.)\n\u201cNot only was it moving in the wrong direction, it was going to continue in the wrong direction no matter what I did,\u201d he continued during a recent interview at the American Enterprise Institute, the conservative perch to which he returned. \u201cSo in the cost-benefit calculus of being in the government, I just felt that on policy terms I could do more outside the government than within.\u201d\nWhen Mr. Bolton stepped aside, Mr. Bush called his departure a disappointment, and for an administration sensitive about criticism, it has turned out to be one. When Mr. Bolton\u2019s name came up in a recent conversation, an administration official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly recalled, the president curtly responded, \u201cInteresting guy,\u201d and changed the subject.\nMr. Bush\u2019s press secretary, Dana Perino,  would say only, \u201cHe has a huge amount of respect for John Bolton.\u201d\nOn the foreign policy crisis of the day, the state of emergency in Pakistan, Mr. Bolton argued that Mr. Bush was na\u00efve to call on Pakistan\u2019s president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, to hold elections. He said elections in Pakistan would risk instability \u2014 perhaps even an Islamic government with a nuclear arsenal.\n\u201cWhile Pervez Musharraf might not be a Jeffersonian democrat, he is the best bet to secure the nuclear arsenal,\u201d he said.\nMr. Bolton\u2019s book \u2014 \u201cSurrender Is Not an Option: Defending America at the United Nations and Abroad\u201d (Threshold Editions) \u2014 is no kiss-and-tell screed against Mr. Bush and his team, though he recounts with relish his conflicts with colleagues and rivals at the United Nations and in the State Department.\nHe describes disputes that pitted his conservative faction against the \u201chigh minded,\u201d those who, in his view, have seized control of not only the media, Congress, the State Department and the United Nations, but now also of the White House.\n\u201cThey picked up some allies among Bush\u2019s political appointees, distracted a few, and seduced others,\u201d Mr. Bolton writes about Mr. Bush\u2019s decision to negotiate with North Korea.\n\u201cThey whispered to the press against the infidels in the new administration who advocated a harder line. They even watched a few of their own go over the side, but they always persisted. And in the Seventh Year, Bush and his team rested. The bureaucracy\u2019s persistence prevailed so overwhelmingly that Bush himself did not even realize it.\u201d\nMr. Bolton, who served first as the State Department\u2019s chief arms control official, argues that the administration has abandoned the unilateralist strategy it followed at the beginning when it bolted from the Kyoto Protocol, the international agreement that limits the emissions of greenhouse gases from most industrialized countries; \u201cunsigned\u201d the agreement that created the International Criminal Court and abrogated the Antiballistic Missile Treaty.\nHe says that only a fundamental change in government, not negotiations, will divert Iran and North Korea from the nuclear path.\n\u201cThey are not going to give up their nuclear weapons voluntarily,\u201d Mr. Bolton said in the interview. \u201cThey might be forced to give up their nuclear weapons, but that is not the policy that we\u2019re pursuing. So the consequence of the policy is that it won\u2019t achieve the stated objective and it will have the effect of legitimizing and reinforcing two fundamentally illegitimate regimes.\u201d\nHe said North Korea\u2019s apparent assistance to Syria in the construction of what analysts and officials said was a nuclear reactor  showed that the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, was already violating its pledge in February to dismantle its nuclear weapons program even though the administration points to a recent trip by Americans to a North Korean nuclear reactor to begin disabling the facilities.\nIn the case of Iran, Mr. Bolton said: \u201cI think this is a very difficult question that has to be very carefully thought out. The choice is not between the world as it is today and the use of force. The choice is between the use of force and Iran with nuclear weapons.\u201d\nMr. Bolton\u2019s disenchantment mirrors that of fiscal conservatives who publicly questioned the White House\u2019s budget policies, especially before Mr. Bush began to veto spending bills approved by the Democratic-controlled Congress.\nOne of those conservatives, Bruce Bartlett, an economist who wrote a book called \u201cImpostor: How George W. Bush Bankrupted America and Betrayed the Reagan Legacy,\u201d said that criticism from the right had the effect of making the administration seem more moderate. But it also makes Mr. Bush seem more isolated.\nIn the current presidential campaign, the leading candidates for the Republican nomination are, arguably, even more hawkish than Mr. Bush on a host of issues, especially Iran.\nMr. Bartlett suggested that on the most pressing issues \u2014 terrorism and the war in Iraq \u2014 Mr. Bush had not yet lost the core of the Republican Party but that criticism like Mr. Bolton\u2019s reflected an intraparty struggle as the Bush presidency neared an end.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you can transform support for Iraq into support for a more aggressive response to Iran,\u201d Mr. Bartlett said. \u201cPeople like John are trying to make that happen.\u201d", "date": "NOV. 9, 2007", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/09/world/middleeast/09bolton.html", "tags": "bush iran administration loyalist policy nuclear \u201c sees bolton soft dangerously white house north korea"}
