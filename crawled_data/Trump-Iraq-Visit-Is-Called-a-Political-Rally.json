{"title": "Trump Iraq Visit Is Called a Political Rally", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 During his surprise visit to American troops in Iraq and Germany this week, President Trump singled out red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d caps in a sea of military fatigues, signed a \u201cTrump 2020\u201d patch and accused Representative Nancy Pelosi and other leading Democrats of being weak on border security.\nNow the president is facing accusations that he was playing politics with the military.\n\u201cWhen that starts happening, it\u2019s like the politicalization of the judicial branch,\u201d said Mark Hertling, a retired three-star Army lieutenant general.\nVisiting troops abroad is a presidential tradition in which the commander in chief puts aside politics to thank a military that represents a broad spectrum of the country. But Mr. Trump\u2019s political comments and his encouragement of supporters in the crowd veered from those norms.\n\u201cHe has to understand that there exist some audiences that should not be addressed as part of his base, because they are not,\u201d Mr. Hertling said. \u201cIt\u2019s a violation of protocol by the president.\u201d\nThen there was the president\u2019s boast, which was incorrect, that the troops would be getting their first raise in more than a decade thanks to his leadership.\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t gotten one in more than 10 years \u2014 more than 10 years,\u201d he told about 100 uniformed troops at Al Asad Air Base in Iraq. \u201cAnd we got you a big one. I got you a big one.\u201d In fact, the military has received steady pay increases for decades.\nMr. Trump also turned a customary Christmas greeting into a broadside against Democrats, who are refusing to fund a wall along the southern border. The stalemate over the wall, Mr. Trump\u2019s signature campaign promise, has resulted in a partial government shutdown.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you folks are aware of what\u2019s happening,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe want to have strong borders in the United States. The Democrats don\u2019t want to let us have strong borders.\u201d\n\u201cYou know why?\u201d he added. \u201cBecause I want it.\u201d\nMr. Trump joked that his solution to obtaining funding for a wall was to claim that he did not want one anymore. \u201cTell Nancy Pelosi I don\u2019t want the wall,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cAnd then we get the wall. That\u2019s another way of doing it.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re fighting for borders in other countries, and they don\u2019t want to fight, the Democrats, for the border of our country,\u201d he added. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense.\u201d\nMs. Pelosi\u2019s deputy chief of staff, Drew Hammill, accused Mr. Trump of turning uniformed troops into scenery for a campaign speech. \u201cHe offered our brave men and women in uniform the bitter insult of using them as political pawns to push his radical right-wing, anti-immigrant agenda,\u201d Mr. Hammill said. \u201cThe president turned his first visit to our troops into another cringe-worthy Donald Trump reality-show special.\u201d\nSome commentators on Fox News also criticized the president for injecting politics into the event.\n\u201cHe talked about the border wall as well, which didn\u2019t have a place there,\u201d Julie Banderas, a Fox News contributor, said on the show \u201cOutnumbered.\u201d Another Fox News contributor on the show, Jessica Tarlov, criticized the president for using the visit \u201cas a campaign rally.\u201d\nThe political paraphernalia on display, which Mr. Trump appeared to encourage during his speech by referencing the caps he had signed, has raised questions at the Defense Department about violations of military protocol by the troops who greeted him. One woman in uniform at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, for instance, welcomed Mr. Trump with a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d flag, according to a photograph posted on Twitter by a Bloomberg News reporter who accompanied Mr. Trump on the trip.\nA directive from the department prohibits active-duty personnel from engaging in \u201cpartisan political activities\u201d and advises that \u201call military personnel should avoid the inference that their political activities imply or appear to imply DoD sponsorship, approval or endorsement of a political candidate, campaign or cause.\u201d Defense Department and Army regulations also prohibit military personnel from showing any political leanings while in uniform, Mr. Hertling said.\nAn official said the department was aware of the situation and \u201ctrying to figure it out\u201d by tracking down photographs of troops holding red caps and campaign flags, and piecing together where the campaign paraphernalia came from.\nMr. Trump said on Thursday that he could not turn down any requests from the soldiers. \u201cIf these brave young people ask me to sign their hat, I will sign,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cCan you imagine my saying NO? We brought or gave NO hats as the Fake News first reported!\u201d\nThe White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said administration officials did not distribute any campaign gear to the troops, and noted that \u201cthese were their personal belongings.\u201d\nOn her Twitter feed, Ms. Sanders addressed a CNN.com report that raised questions about whether the red caps displayed for Mr. Trump to sign may have violated a military rule.\n\u201cCNN will attack anyone who supports President Trump, including the brave men and women of our military who fight everyday to protect our freedom,\u201d Ms. Sanders wrote. She declined to comment further on the president\u2019s speech.\nIn his remarks, Mr. Trump also boasted that he had secured \u201cbillions and billions of dollars of new equipment\u201d for the military.\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting such new equipment, your eyes are popping, right?\u201d he asked the troops.", "date": "Dec. 27, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/27/us/politics/trump-troops-iraq-germany.html", "tags": "mr. military visit troops president political \u201d trump rally called iraq campaign"}
