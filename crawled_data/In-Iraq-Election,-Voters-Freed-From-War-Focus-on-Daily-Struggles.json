{"title": "In Iraq Election, Voters Freed From War Focus on Daily Struggles", "content": "BAGHDAD \u2014 Four years ago, Iraqis united in a fight to free their country from what many viewed as an existential threat: the Islamic State, which held nearly one-third of Iraq in its grip.\nThis weekend, the nation held its first election since defeating the extremist group, a vote extraordinary for featuring ordinary bread-and-butter issues like corruption and unemployment \u2014 not security \u2014 as its major themes.\nIn many ways, the remarkably peaceful election on Saturday was both a vivid illustration of how far the nation of about 37 million people has come since 2014 \u2014 and of the depth of the problems that remain.\nUnlike votes in previous years, this election was notable for a lack of sectarianism, especially among the leading Shiite-led coalitions. Political analysts attributed this to a changed public mood; sectarianism is now seen as the major cause of the bloodshed and devastation suffered since the American military invasion in 2003.\nOn Election Day, this led to historic scenes. In Iraq\u2019s second-largest city, Mosul, a Sunni bastion that was taken over by the Islamic State in 2014, significant numbers of voters said they were crossing sectarian lines.\n\u201cI wanted to make a point of voting away from religion and sectarianism\u201d and \u201cinstill a sense of nationhood and patriotism in the hearts of our children,\u201d said one voter, Khalid al-Dabbagh. He said he would cast his ballot for the coalition of Iraq\u2019s current prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, which, while led by Shiites, includes Sunnis and Kurds.\nIn a country awash with weapons and random violence, Election Day was notably quiet, without any major incidents. Six members of the security forces died when their vehicles hit two explosive devices in Kirkuk Province, and several people were wounded by a rocket in Diyala Province. The government significantly increased security patrols around polling stations days before voting began.\nWith official results not expected until Monday, the final shape of the next Parliament was not clear.\nBut what was apparent was voter apathy. The lackluster turnout of 44.5 percent \u2014 the lowest since the country\u2019s first democratic election in 2005 \u2014 reflects a worrying challenge: a crisis of confidence in the political system as well as Iraq\u2019s establishment parties.\nGhassan al-Rasoul, a pharmacist in Baghdad, was among the millions of Iraqis who did not vote. While he said he respected the struggle and sacrifice it had taken to achieve what is considered one of the most democratic systems in the Arab world, Mr. Rasoul said he was frustrated that members of Iraq\u2019s political elite had failed to address basic issues like corruption, failing infrastructure and unemployment.\n\u201cI have voted twice before, and I overcame so many security challenges to have the opportunity to participate in those elections,\u201d Mr. Rasoul said. \u201cThis time, it\u2019s safe. But, I didn\u2019t vote. I have concluded that they are all in it for themselves. The same faces remain in power, but we have no development.\u201d\nCorruption was a key issue for voters, with many Iraqis expressing the wish to kick out established figures, and bring in new blood.\nPartial results announced late Sunday by Iraq\u2019s electoral commission showed a surprisingly strong performance by the Sairoon coalition led by Moktada al-Sadr, a former Shiite militia commander who once targeted American forces, but in recent years has become a firebrand, anti-establishment populist who campaigned against corruption.\nWith 95 percent of the votes counted in Baghdad, Sairoon won more than double the votes of its nearest competitor, Fatah,  or Conquest, led by Hadi al-Ameri, another former Shiite militia commander who was in charge of the umbrella force of paramilitary units created in 2014 to help defeat the Islamic State.\nThe capital has by far the most seats in Iraq\u2019s 329-member Parliament.\nSairoon and Fatah were also the biggest winners in the 10 of Iraq\u2019s 18 provinces for which the electoral commission released results, finishing in either first or second place.\nThe prime minister\u2019s Nasr, or Victory, coalition, placed third or fourth in most of these areas.\nIn Baghdad, where security and job opportunities have been among the best in the country, unofficial voting turnout figures were lower than the national average, indicating that only about 35 percent of registered voters cast their ballots on Saturday.\nMuhammed Zubaidi, a politically active young man who had knocked on doors in his neighborhood to support his political movement, Hikma, shopped for groceries on Saturday after going to the polls in his Baghdad neighborhood, Karrada.\nHe said Iraqis needed to get politically involved to change their problems. But he conceded that his enthusiasm had not been enough to sway many of his friends.\n\u201cNo one else I know voted today,\u201d he said, waving his blue index finger as a sign that he had cast his ballot. \u201cThey are all frustrated.\u201d\nSaid Hussein, 43, a civil servant, said he had decided to boycott the election out of frustration with what he saw as politics as usual and a lack of big ideas to improve life. His wife, he said, argued with him to go vote with her, but he refused.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t find a single face that I trusted or believed in,\u201d Mr. Hussein said he told his wife. \u201cWhat have any of them done for us?\u201d\nHawla Habib, a professor at Mustansiriya University in Baghdad, who did vote, casting her ballot for Mr. Abadi, said voter apathy could, in large part, be explained by the sheer exhaustion of being Iraqi \u2014 surviving the battles against the Islamic State, the years of sectarian violence and daily struggles to create a better life for one\u2019s children.\n\u201cAll Iraqis care about their nation,\u201d Mrs. Habib said. \u201cIt\u2019s just that many are too tired to think anymore.\u201d", "date": "May 13, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/13/world/middleeast/iraq-election.html", "tags": "freed election \u201c voters daily iraqis focus war baghdad struggles many \u2014 iraq vote"}
