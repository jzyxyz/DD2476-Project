{"title": "Where American Politics Can Still Work: From the Bottom Up", "content": "LANCASTER, Pa. \u2014 Last week I wrote about why political parties across the industrial world are fracturing from the top down. Today I\u2019m writing about the political units that are working. On this Fourth of July, if you want to be an optimist about America, stand on your head. The country looks so much better from the bottom up.\nI know \u2014 the current clich\u00e9 is that we\u2019re a country divided by two coasts, two coasts that are supposedly diversifying, pluralizing, modernizing and globalizing, while in flyover America everyone is high on opioids, cheering for President Trump and waiting for 1950 to return. That\u2019s totally wrong.\nOur country is actually a checkerboard of cities and communities \u2014 some that are forming what I call \u201ccomplex adaptive coalitions\u201d and are thriving from the bottom up, and others that can\u2019t build such adaptive coalitions and are rapidly deteriorating. You can find both on the coasts and both in the interior \u2014 and you can find both in just one little corner of south-central Pennsylvania.\nI was invited in April to give a paid book talk here in Lancaster, and I was so blown away by the societal innovation the town\u2019s leaders had employed to rebuild their once-struggling city and county that I decided to return with my reporter\u2019s notebook and interview them.\nMy original host was the Hourglass, a foundation founded by community leaders in Lancaster County in 1997, when the city of Lancaster was a crime-ridden ghost town at night where people were afraid to venture and when the county\u2019s dominant industrial employer, Armstrong World Industries, was withering.\nSome of the leading citizens decided that \u201ctime was running out\u201d \u2014 hence \u201cHourglass\u201d \u2014 and that no cavalry was coming to save them \u2014 not from the state\u2019s capital or the nation\u2019s capital. They realized that the only way they could replace Armstrong and re-energize the downtown was not with another dominant company, but by throwing partisan politics out the window and forming a complex adaptive coalition in which business leaders, educators, philanthropists, social innovators and the local government would work together to unleash entrepreneurship and forge whatever compromises were necessary to fix the city.\nPretty much the exact opposite of what\u2019s happening in Washington, D.C., today.\nFor my 2016, \u201cThank You for Being Late,\u201d I profiled the complex adaptive coalition \u2014 called the Itasca Project \u2014 that had emerged to re-energize my hometown, Minneapolis. I\u2019ve since seen such coalitions popping up all over the world \u2014 from Knoxville, Tenn., to Sheridan, Wyo.; from Broward County, Fla., to Birmingham, Ala.; and from Mexicali, Mexico, to the Western Galilee in Israel.\nOne of the most successful is Hourglass, which defined its mission as being a \u201ctrusted source for information, innovative ideas and insights that will help stakeholders, elected officials and voters make more informed and enlightened decisions\u201d to advance the community. In these dark days of our national politics, these emerging coalitions are a real source of optimism for me.\nAt 7:30 Friday morning in early June, the Hourglass leaders in Lancaster were all sitting around the kitchen table at Art Mann Sr.\u2019s house, as they do every Friday. The seven men and women representing different Lancaster societal and business interests were discussing the region\u2019s shortage of clean water, because of farm runoff, fertilizer and salt on the streets.\nNone is in city government or an elected politician; they\u2019re just respected volunteer community activists who will make a recommendation, based on research, to the city or county to get a problem fixed and help galvanize resources to do it. They all know one another\u2019s party affiliation, but they\u2019ve checked them at Mann\u2019s front door.\n\u201cThe key to it all is trust,\u201d Mann explained to me. \u201cPolitically we are all different, and our experiences are different. You can only get progress where there is trust. People trust that we are not in it for personal agendas and not partisan agendas.  We will often host elected officials, and they will throw out ideas and we will give them feedback. And they are not worried it will go out of this room.\u201d\nAs the breakfast wore on, I was reminded of the business philosopher Dov Seidman\u2019s dictum that \u201ctrust is the only legal performance-enhancing drug.\u201d And I recalled Israeli societal innovator Gidi Grinstein\u2019s dictum that what is saving so many communities today is \u201cleadership without authority \u2014 so many people stepping up to lead beyond their formal authority.\u201d\nMann, a Republican local metals manufacturer who began his civic life running for the school board, was one of the original conveners of Hourglass \u2014 after looking around Lancaster in the early 1990s and seeing a county that was hemorrhaging jobs and a city that was dying and wholly unprepared for the 21st century.\n\u201cMy family has been here since 1740 and was always interested in public service,\u201d Mann told me. \u201cWe could see that in the late \u201990s that the county was going to hell if we didn\u2019t do something. People thought the city was unsafe. If we let the city die, it would affect the whole county.\u201d\nGreater Lancaster is a microcosm of America.  The city has a population of 60,000, about 40 percent of whom are white, 40 percent Latino \u2014 mostly Puerto Ricans whose parents came decades ago to process chickens. About 15 percent are African-Americans, and the rest are a rainbow of Asians and immigrants and refugees from as far afield as Afghanistan, Nepal, Iraq and Syria. The city, though, is ringed by largely white suburbs \u2014 and beyond them a countryside dominated by Amish and Mennonite farmers and crafts people.  The county\u2019s total population is about 600,000.\nUnwilling to let their hometown die a slow death, and fed up with weak municipal politicians, Mann and other civic leaders \u201cgot together in my living room\u201d to become catalysts for change. \u201cOur first insight was that leadership matters\u201d \u2014 and if it wasn\u2019t going to come from the politicians, then it would come from them \u2014 and it would be devoid of party politics.\nThe Lancaster ethic was best described to me by Ray D\u2019Agostino, president of the Lancaster Housing & Opportunity Partnership, one of myriad young societal entrepreneurs I met here. His nonprofit mobilizes citizens to contribute time and resources to build and repair affordable housing.\n\u201cThere is big P politics \u2014 party politics \u2014 and small P politics,\u201d said D\u2019Agostino. \u201cWe check the big P at the door and just worry about solving the issues \u2014 not worrying about what Republicans or Democrats think about it. It [became] ingrained in us. We still look at things in a conservative or liberal way, but I can work with my liberal friends because we agree on what needs to be done \u2014 and it has to get done. I won\u2019t vote for them, but I will work with them. And you are talking to a guy who is the chairman of the Republican Party for our local school district!\u201d\nWhen visitors from nearby York, Reading or Harrisburg \u2014 communities not doing all that well \u2014 see what\u2019s happening in Lancaster, \u201cthis is all foreign to them,\u201d added D\u2019Agostino. \u201cI tell them: \u2018You don\u2019t know how to collaborate. You\u2019re still working in silos.\u2019\u201d When a leader from York told him: \u201cRay, you know, we take care of our own. We\u2019re doing things our way,\u201d D\u2019Agostino responded, \u201cMaybe that\u2019s part of the problem.\u201d\nThat\u2019s also how it used to be in Lancaster. Back around 2000, \u201cnobody was talking to each other,\u201d recalled Mann, which is why the convention center and other projects were stalled. So in December 2005 Hourglass started the \u201cFirst Friday Noontime Forum\u201d to get community leaders, business owners and elected officials into one room \u2014 with no press \u2014 to discuss all the components of fixing the city.\n\u201cWe found that people who were responsible for key parts of the city, business and government had never met each other,\u201d said Mann. \u201cThey were all in their own silos, and we \u2014 Hourglass \u2014 were neutral, so we could get them together.\u201d\nMany locals say the turnaround began in the early 2000s, when Lancaster got the chance to have a minor-league baseball team and stadium. The ballpark was originally planned for the suburbs \u2014 no one would come downtown at night \u2014 but a public-private coalition emerged to locate the stadium in the city\u2019s northwest corridor in 2005. Recalled Mann: \u201cI went to opening night and sat next to people from suburbia and they said, \u2018Wow, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m in Lancaster.\u2019\u201d\nAt the same time, Hourglass, and other groups provided the funds so public officials and the private sector could learn from the best experts in the world on how to lift their city and businesses. These included bringing in the mayor of Charleston, S.C., Joseph Riley, to explain how to build a thriving downtown; Edward Deming to teach quality improvement strategies; and an urban development expert from Brookings, Christopher Leinberger, to help create a long-term growth vision for the city and county. They\u2019ve even looked to Denmark for insights.\nI found the hunger for best practices profound. \u201cThere is an awareness that all good ideas don\u2019t start here,\u201d said Susan Eckert, president of the Lancaster Partnership for Health. \u201cWho is the best small-city mayor? Let\u2019s call \u2019em. Who is the best urban planner? Call \u2019em. Who are the education transformers? Call \u2019em. Who is doing the most interesting stuff in public health? Call \u2019em. No one is bowling alone here. The civic life and engagement are as rich and dense as anything I have ever seen.\u201d\nThe momentum for change really picked up, though, around 2006 when a dynamic new mayor was elected, J. Richard Gray, who worked with the Hourglass team, local business leaders and societal innovators to take Lancaster to a new level.  Gray, with the help of Leinberger, started by drawing up a long-term revitalization plan, which he carried around on a small note card every day to make sure every decision aligned with it.\nGray describes himself as a \u201cDemocratic capitalist,\u201d which, he said, means: support businesses to invest in town \u2014 because there are no employees without employers \u2014 make sure they pay people a living wage and don\u2019t damage the environment. It was a balance a lot of locals of all political stripes found appealing.\n\u201cOn the local level I don\u2019t know how many people would come up to me and say: \u2018I am a Republican but I really like what you do,\u2019\u201d said Gray. \u201cWe have gotten over the partisan divide.\u201d\nAlso in the early 2000s, farsighted community leaders at Franklin & Marshall, the dominant local university, and Lancaster General Hospital, the town\u2019s biggest employer, decided to get together to redevelop the street that connected them, creating a new urban hub of restaurants, entertainment and housing called the \u201cJames Street Improvement District\u201d (which later grew into the Lancaster City Alliance to work on improvements all across the city).\nF&M and the hospital each committed $250,000 a year for three years to improve the whole northwest quadrant of the city, offering financial incentives for people to buy homes along James Street and fix them up. That led to more attractive homes, park benches, trash cans and lighting, and to F&M eventually tearing down some of the hedges that separated it from the city and making it better neighbor. F&M also built a beautiful new sports complex on the grounds of the demolished Armstrong World Industries plant. The whole corridor has since been reborn as the \u201cEds and Meds\u201d district.\nAll successful complex adaptive coalitions have some kind of college or university in their town. Gray told me he once remarked to F&M\u2019s president, \u201cYou want to make Lancaster a place where students want to come and I want to make it a place where graduates want to stay.\u201d\nWord got around. Restaurants, bars, coffee houses and businesses began moving in across Lancaster, bringing many young people and start-ups with them.\nBut it was the partnership among Hourglass, the mayor and local business and community leaders and politicians to get the stalled convention center built and a Marriott Hotel next to it \u2014 in the heart of the city \u2014 that made downtown Lancaster not just somewhere people drove through on their way to boutique hotels in Amish country, but a destination of its own.\nIt wasn\u2019t only the First Friday Forum\u2019s getting people together that broke the deadlock over the convention center. It was Gray\u2019s willingness to work with any Republican who would work with him. In particular, he forged a quiet partnership with Lloyd Smucker, a Republican who was then a state senator, to establish a community reinvestment zone that created the income stream to pay off the bonds needed to fund the convention center. \u201cThat was because Smucker and I could work together,\u201d said Gray. \u201cYou get an awful lot done if you don\u2019t worry who gets credit.\u201d\nPart of Gray\u2019s strategic plan was also to bring public art into the city. \u201cArt makes people feel better about themselves and their communities,\u201d he told me, \u201cso we made a huge push for public art, and we included the neighborhoods in deciding what kind of public art \u2014 and we now have a full-time director of public art for every development in the city.\u201d\nBy February 2018, a month after Gray stepped down after three terms as mayor, Lancaster  was named by Forbes as one of the \u201c10 Coolest U.S. Cities to Visit,\u201d saying this \u201cnewly hip Victorian city \u2014 just three hours from New York City \u2014 is still one of the U.S.\u2019s best kept secrets.\u201d It \u201cboasts a bustling food scene and is quickly becoming a cultural hotbed. The architecture is the real star, so explore the alleys and cobblestone streets by foot, checking out the many repurposed old warehouses that house thriving businesses.\u201d\nBut for all its progress digging itself out of a deep hole \u2014 by bridging political divides \u2014 racial divides and policing issues are alive in Lancaster, just like in other cities.\nLast Thursday a white Lancaster police officer used a Taser on a 27-year-old black man who was sitting on a curb during an arrest \u2014 which he did not appear to be resisting. A bystander\u2019s video of the tasing has amassed more than two million views on Facebook. It\u2019s quite disturbing. The new mayor, Danene Sorace, who has ordered an investigation, told me, \u201cThe progress Lancaster has made in recent years is too precious a thing for us not to respond to this incident in a meaningful way \u2026 and with systemic changes that we were already working on.\u201d\nThe unemployment rate in Lancaster County is 3.3 percent while in the city it\u2019s over 10 percent. And while some 30 percent of the city lives below the poverty line, it reaches 50 percent in some of the poorest neighborhoods.\nIn other words, this is not nirvana. What differentiates Lancaster from its neighbors is the degree to which it built a complex adaptive coalition to save the city from terminal decline, the resources this has created to try to bridge its still tough economic and racial divides \u2014 and the sheer number of people here who want to get caught trying.\nYou name a challenge and someone here has started a nonprofit \u2014 the Lancaster Coalition for XYZ \u2014 to fix it. For instance, it was the Lancaster County Lead Coalition that brought the City Council\u2019s attention to the horrors of lead poisoning in impoverished neighborhood rental properties, which led to a new set of safety ordinances. How many counties have a lead coalition?\nRandy Patterson is director of economic development and neighborhood revitalization for the city and past president of the county United Way board. The United Way used to raise dollars through workplace campaigns and then distribute them to 30-some local agencies and partners, each going its own way.\n\u201cThere were no community-oriented goals,\u201d explained Patterson. \u201cSo the board moved to a collective-impact model \u2014 four bold goals over 10 years \u2014 aimed at reducing poverty by 50 percent; making sure that every child is kindergarten-ready in terms of basic learning skills; ensuring that every adult has access to postsecondary education and credentials; and ensuring that every citizen has access to some kind of health care.\nSo now, he said, \u201cwe raise money through the United Way, but we will only fund collaborative efforts to achieve those four goals. Grants are also for three years, not just one. We\u2019re funding elements of 100 different agencies now, working collaboratively toward these four goals,\u201d and \u201cwe partnered with F&M to measure our success.\u201d\nTo succeed in today\u2019s world, concluded Patterson, a community has to decide \u201cwhat it wants to be\u201d \u2014 no one is stopping you, but no one will do it for you. Lancaster got that. A lot of its neighboring towns haven\u2019t.\nThe Amish and Mennonites are not just a tourist attraction around here. These faith communities, with their strong family values, work ethic and openness to refugees \u2014 they came to this region to flee religious persecution themselves \u2014 are one of the unique attributes and competitive advantages of Lancaster.\n\u201cWe have a refugee inflow 20 times the national average,\u201d said Gray, \u201cand we say, \u2019I don\u2019t care where you\u2019re from, you are welcome here.\u2019\u201d Local churches, synagogues and mosques have all been active in resettlement, as has business.\nAt the same time, there are roughly 13,000 job openings in Lancaster County, said Tom Baldridge, president of the Chamber of Commerce. Everyone is looking for workers. \u201cThe broader business community here is pro-immigration and wanting to make sure we can assimilate [immigrants] into the community as quickly as we can,\u201d Baldridge said. \u201cThe average education level of immigrants is higher than ours, and [while] the language barrier is real, they have a work ethic beyond belief \u2014 and they love America. We just had dinner with a family from Syria, and afterward we were saying to ourselves, \u2018Why are we scared of this?\u2019\u201d\nSam Bressi, C.E.O. of the Lancaster County Community Foundation, a private trust set up decades ago that now boasts $100 million in assets, put it to me this way: \u201cWe are not an extraordinary community unless we are an extraordinary community for everyone here. We started the country\u2019s first refugee-oriented community center \u2014 located at a middle school.\u201d It brings together in one neighborhood school all the different nonprofit services the community has to offer for immigrants, a one-stop shop for kids and parents.\nTo be certain that they were in tune with the direction the community wanted to go, Bressi\u2019s foundation also started a \u201ccommunity champion quiz. We set up pop-up booths all over town \u2014 in the central market, local coffee shops, a bilingual training center \u2014 and had a film crew with each one. We asked people: \u2018What is the most important thing for a successful community?\u2019\n\u201cThe answers that came up over and over again,\u201d Bressi said, \u201cwere a community that creates respect and unity, respect and unity. People want to be heard and want to be respected. And they want unity, no divides. They see the national trends, they feel the division and they don\u2019t want it.\u201d\nDamaris Rau, superintendent of the Lancaster School District, presides over 11,500 students \u2014 mostly poor, black and brown \u2014 who speak 37 languages. \u201cMy biggest challenge is that 90 percent of our students are eligible for free and reduced lunch,\u201d she told me. To attract more affluent students, the district long ago instituted an international baccalaureate program. To help more needy students, Rau developed a program by which high school seniors who have completed all of their graduation requirements can take college courses in areas of their interest or needed technical skills, like nursing, and the city will pay their tuition. \u201cIt gives them a leg up when they start college.\u201d\nRau told me about how one church noticed that there were a lot of children waiting for their public school to open each morning, because parents dropped them off and had to get to work. So for the last three years the church has opened early to provide breakfast for the kids.\nAnother thing I\u2019ve seen in all complex adaptive coalitions is the business community getting involved in both K-12 and college courses, translating in real time the skills demanded by global businesses today \u2014 not waiting for the schools to figure it out.\nFor instance, Pete Slaugh Jr., managing director of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices, decided to fund a program in entrepreneurship \u2014 with classroom, mentoring and hands-on experiences \u2014 at Millersville University, near Lancaster, to teach students how to turn ideas into products or services. \u201cWe need to make sure employers have workers with the actual skills they need,\u201d said Slaugh.\nCan Lancaster\u2019s successes be replicated?\nYes. Its problems are global and the strategies Lancaster has employed to resurrect itself are shared by complex adaptive coalitions I\u2019ve visited all over. The organization Grinstein, the societal innovator, created, called Reut, is helping to catalyze some in Israel. I took him with me to Lancaster, and afterward he noted common features that all of these successful coalitions share:\n1. They are mostly started and inspired by civic leaders with no formal authority, and not by politicians, and are driven not by party ideology or affiliation but by a relentless \u201cwhat-works attitude.\u201d\n2. They all begin with a vision, strategy and benchmarks for rebuilding their community, which enable them \u201cto harness each element of the community and mobilize their unique resources, and societal innovations, behind this vision. \u2026 We call this \u2018extending the yoke.\u2019 The longer yoke you have, the more horses you can have pulling the wagon \u2014 and in a community, the \u2018yoke\u2019 is the inspiring vision and the \u2018horses\u2019 are the business leaders, social entrepreneurs, local colleges, philanthropies, nonprofits and faith-based institutions.\u201d\n3. They understand that there are no quick fixes for regenerating a community, which is why civic leadership is so crucial \u2014 \u201cbecause civic leaders can adopt a long-term view that transcends political tenures.\u201d\nAnd I would add one more:  Not a single community leader I spoke to in Lancaster said the progress was due to technology \u2014 to microchips. They all said it was due to relationships \u2014 relationships born not of tribal solidarity but of putting aside tribal differences to do big hard things together in their collective interest. It\u2019s a beautiful thing to see.\nSo, on this Fourth of July, it\u2019s worth remembering that it was our ability to do big hard things together as Americans that also got us this far as a country. And if you want to be reminded of what that looks like \u2014 because it is so easy to forget these days \u2014 Art Mann is serving breakfast for the Hourglass folks in his kitchen this Friday. It starts at 7:30 a.m. \u2014 and I\u2019m sure he\u2019d invite you in.", "date": "July 3, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/03/opinion/community-revitalization-lancaster.html", "tags": "american work lancaster community county city bottom \u201d one \u2014 politics said still"}
