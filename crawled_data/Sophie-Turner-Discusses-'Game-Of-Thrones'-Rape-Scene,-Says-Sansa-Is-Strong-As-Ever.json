{"title": "Sophie Turner Discusses 'Game Of Thrones' Rape Scene, Says Sansa Is Strong As Ever", "content": "If Sansa Stark is anything, she's strong.\u00a0\nSophie Turner discussed her \"Game of Thrones\" character\u00a0and the Season 5 rape scene\u00a0involving Sansa and new husband Ramsay Bolton while on a panel with her co-stars at Comic-Con in San Diego Saturday. The scene in question appeared in a May episode, and some viewers vowed to quit the show altogether after viewing the horrible moment. Some felt the way the gratuitous rape scene was shot -- with the camera focusing on Theon Greyjoy (Alfie Allen) instead of Sansa -- undermined the Stark daughter, whose character arc saw her prevail and become more secure despite the many tragedies she faced.\u00a0\nBut on Saturday, Turner made it clear that Sansa is no less powerful than she was before.\u00a0\n\"[If] there's one thing that Sansa still is, despite what happened to her, [it's] strong,\" she said when asked by an attendee about the scene. \"She\u2019s not to blame for any of that. I really don\u2019t know why they ... focused on Theon, because I was giving a great performance.\"\u00a0\nShe explained that life with the Boltons could spell Sansa's own death, and the scene spoke to the many facets of her character.\u00a0\n\u201cShe thought it through in her head.\u00a0She could have fought back if she wanted to, but she didn\u2019t,\" she said. \"And I think that's, you know, it's good for her character. She's one of those characters that does her scheming in her mind, not outwardly.\"\u00a0\nAuthor George R.R. Martin defended HBO's choice to include the scene, which does not occur in the books, after it aired. And\u00a0Turner previously said she \"secretly loved\"\u00a0having such a \"daunting\" component added to the script. \u00a0\nWatch the Q&A below.\u00a0\n\ufeffAlso on HuffPost:\nTo subscribe to our HuffPost Entertainment WhatsApp account:\n1.
