{"title": "Libya as a Model for Disarmament? North Korea May See It Very Differently", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 When John R. Bolton looks at North Korea, he sees Libya. It is not a perfect comparison, he acknowledges, but if there is a model for how to peacefully rid a hostile dictatorial state of its nuclear program, he points to the disarming of Libya some 15 years ago.\nIt is easy to grasp why the United States views that as a success. A ruthless despot with a history of sponsoring terrorism surrendered his efforts to build a catastrophic weapon. But that despot, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, might not see it as such a good deal today. No one will ever know for sure because he is dead. Which is why North Korea might not find it such an uplifting model either.\nThe divergent vantage points on Libya may be instructive to understand how President Trump and Mr. Bolton, his new national security adviser, are approaching the coming talks with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. The divide also underscores the challenges Mr. Trump and Mr. Bolton face: As they seek to replicate the feat of eliminating Libya\u2019s nuclear program, analysts said, they could face distrust because of the unexpected turn of events that led to Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s demise.\nMr. Bolton, who served under President George W. Bush, views Libya through the experience of those heady days in 2003 and 2004 when Colonel Qaddafi agreed to transfer his nuclear equipment to a facility in Tennessee. Mr. Kim may remember what came later, when President Barack Obama and European allies launched military action against Libya in 2011 to prevent a threatened massacre of civilians, in the process enabling rebels not only to topple Colonel Qaddafi but also to hunt him down and kill him.\nWould Colonel Qaddafi have given up that nuclear weapons program if he had known what was to come? Would the United States and Europe have used force against a nuclear-armed country? Not likely. And therein lies the rub with North Korea. Mr. Kim and his father built a nuclear arsenal for the very purpose of ensuring the security of their state against the kind of intervention that happened in Libya, which is why North Korea has insisted the United States promise not to invade as part of any deal.\n\u201cI heard directly from the Chinese that the Libyan model did not inspire confidence in Pyongyang,\u201d said Antony J. Blinken, a deputy secretary of state under Mr. Obama. \u201cI would be very concerned that the combination of Libya and then Trump tearing up the Iran agreement sends exactly the wrong message to Kim Jong-un and undermines whatever hope exists for negotiations.\u201d\nMr. Bolton raised the Libya example in weekend interviews on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on CBS and \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d his first television appearances since becoming national security adviser early this month.\n\u201cWe have very much in mind the Libya model from 2003, 2004,\u201d he said on Fox. \u201cThere are obviously differences. The Libyan program was much smaller, but that was basically the agreement that we made.\u201d\nThe most important comparison, he said, would be testing North Korea to see if it had genuinely made an unqualified determination to abandon its nuclear weapons. \u201cIt would be a manifestation of the strategic decision to give up nuclear weapons,\u201d Mr. Bolton said on CBS. \u201cDoesn\u2019t have to be the same as Libya, but it\u2019s got to be something concrete and tangible. It may be that Kim Jong-un has some ideas and we should hear him out.\u201d\nIn the history of the atomic age, only four countries have voluntarily given up nuclear weapons. South Africa ended its secret nuclear program in 1989, destroying a half-dozen bombs. Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan all gave up the nuclear weapons that were stationed on their territory after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 and they became independent nations.\nBut Ukraine has found reason for second-guessing. The Budapest Memorandum that sealed its denuclearization in 1994 included promises by the United States, Britain and Russia to respect the country\u2019s sovereignty and borders. But in 2014, Russia annexed Crimea and supported Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. Given that, a member of Ukraine\u2019s Parliament said at the time that \u201cnow there\u2019s a strong sentiment in Ukraine that we made a big mistake\u201d in giving up its weapons.\nOthers like Brazil and Taiwan sought nuclear weapons but abandoned the efforts short of building bombs. Iran was not known to have weapons but did have a nuclear program that seemed intended to develop them when it signed an agreement with Mr. Obama\u2019s administration in 2015 to give up its program \u2014 the same agreement Mr. Trump has excoriated and threatened to rip up by May 12.\nSimilarly, Libya did not have nuclear weapons but had a program to develop them when it changed course in 2003. Colonel Qaddafi initiated secret negotiations with the Bush administration and the British to dismantle his program in exchange for easing international sanctions.\nThe decision reflected years of effort to end the country\u2019s isolation. But the key agreement came just days after Iraq\u2019s deposed leader, Saddam Hussein, was found in a spider hole in Iraq after an American invasion that had been justified as an effort to rid a dangerous regime of weapons of mass destruction. Colonel Qaddafi signaled that he did not intend to suffer the same fate.\nRobert Joseph, the national security aide who brokered the deal for Mr. Bush with the support of Mr. Bolton, said on Sunday that his former colleague was right to look to Libya. \u201cI do think John\u2019s onto something here,\u201d he said.\n\u201cLook, Libya is not North Korea,\u201d he added. \u201cThe Libyan program was far more advanced than we had thought it was, but it\u2019s far less advanced than where North Korea is today. No question, Libya does not represent the sort of military threat that North Korea does. The two situations are different.\n\u201cBut you\u2019re not saying we\u2019re going to do everything just like we did with Libya,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat you\u2019re doing is you\u2019re drawing lessons from that experience. If you don\u2019t do that, we\u2019re going to end up right where we\u2019ve ended up before multiple times over the last 25 years, which is failure.\u201d\nAmong the lessons of Libya that apply to North Korea, he said, echoing Mr. Bolton\u2019s comment, is the need for a genuine decision by Mr. Kim to completely give up his program, not just hedge. Another is to use all the tools available, including intelligence, economic leverage, diplomacy and threat of force. Another is to insist on complete \u201canywhere, anytime\u201d access for inspectors to all potential nuclear sites.\nBut other specialists find the situations so different that the comparison is unhelpful. \u201cLibya hardly had a nuclear weapons program,\u201d said Robert J. Einhorn, a special adviser for nonproliferation and arms control in Mr. Obama\u2019s State Department and now a scholar at the Brookings Institution. \u201cIt had crates with centrifuge parts it didn\u2019t know what to do with. U.S. transport planes could land and carry the entire \u2018program\u2019 away.\u201d\nBy contrast, said Mr. Einhorn, \u201cNorth Korea has nuclear weapons. We don\u2019t know how many. It has nuclear production facilities. We don\u2019t know where they all are. Verifying what they have and dismantling all of it would take years.\u201d\nColonel Qaddafi\u2019s violent end was not directly related to the 2003 deal. Nearly eight years after his agreement with Mr. Bush, the Libyan dictator was confronted with a popular uprising as part of the Arab Spring 2011. He vowed to crush his opponents, including civilians, prompting Mr. Obama and European allies to intervene to stop him.\nThe Obama administration at the time denied any connection between the intervention and the previous nuclear disarmament. But Mr. Joseph said Mr. Obama should have given more thought to the consequences. \u201cThey made the decision to intervene without a day-after plan or any sense of what nonproliferation message that would send,\u201d he said.\nNorth Korea has made this connection before. In 2011, North Korea\u2019s official news agency carried comments by a Foreign Ministry official calling the earlier nuclear bargain with Libya \u201can invasion tactic to disarm the country,\u201d in effect a bait-and-switch. \u201cThe Libyan crisis is teaching the international community a grave lesson,\u201d the ministry official said.\nEach side sees its own very different lessons.", "date": "April 29, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/29/us/politics/bolton-libya-north-korea-trump.html", "tags": "may see nuclear libya \u201c model disarmament program weapons differently north korea"}
