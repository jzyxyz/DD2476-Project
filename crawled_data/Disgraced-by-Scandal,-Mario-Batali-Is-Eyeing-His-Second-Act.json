{"title": "Disgraced by Scandal, Mario Batali Is Eyeing His Second Act", "content": "On a gloomy Friday afternoon in February, Mario Batali sat down for coffee at the Marlton Hotel, a few blocks from Babbo, his restaurant in Greenwich Village. His guest was the food consultant and writer Christine Muhlke.\nMr. Batali had called the meeting, as he has with several other people whose opinions he trusts, to figure out how his life and career might recover from a disastrous turn.\nIn December, a series of news reports about the celebrity chef began tumbling out. Several women described a decades-long pattern of abusive behavior both in his empire and at restaurants owned by friends that ranged from lewd, drunken propositions to physical groping, including one incident at the Spotted Pig in the West Village in which a woman appeared too intoxicated to respond.\nMr. Batali, 57, said he didn\u2019t recall all the reported episodes, but immediately apologized. His popular, prolific social media feeds largely fell silent. ABC pulled him from its weekday talk show \u201cThe Chew.\u201d Food Network canceled plans to remake his first program, \u201cMolto Mario.\u201d Eataly, the Italian food emporium in which he has a minor stake, took his products off its shelves. He stepped away from daily operations in the Batali & Bastianich Hospitality Group, which has 24 restaurants and nearly 2,100 employees.\nSeveral powerful men, in several industries, have had their worlds kicked out from under them as the #MeToo movement has gathered momentum. As many have removed themselves from public sight, forfeited business interests or sought treatment, a question lingers: Is a comeback from such disgrace possible?\nMr. Batali, who has never been known for his patience, is asking that question \u2014 actively exploring when or whether he should begin his. Friends and associates say he is floating ideas, pondering timelines and examining whether there is a way for him to step back into his career, at least in some fashion.\nMr. Batali declined to be interviewed, saying he was \u201cstill figuring out my stuff.\u201d Those who have spoken with him recently said he appears to be deeply introspective and seeking counsel on what his future might hold, both personally and professionally.\nMr. Batali is examining what he has called his blind spots and considering how life might look when he is not, as he told one person he consulted over the winter, \u201cthe lead singer.\u201d He told a colleague that he is simply trying to learn to be the wallpaper in the room and not the room itself.\nNonetheless, Mr. Batali has sketched several scenarios that put him in the driver\u2019s seat but cede some control, people he has spoken with recently say. One is creating a new company led by a powerful woman chief executive. In early February, he broached the idea with Federica Marchionni, the former president of Dolce & Gabbana, who was briefly the chief executive of Lands\u2019 End.\nThis month, he is traveling to Rwanda and Greece to work with refugees as a private citizen. He is thinking about creating a program in which chefs can join him a few times a year to help displaced Rwandans as they return to their country.\nOn the other hand, Mr. Batali has said, he might just move to the Amalfi Coast.\nHe is still wrestling with the future of the restaurant group that he started with his partner, Joe Bastianich, in 1998 when they opened Babbo. The two men are communicating through lawyers these days, negotiating a complicated buyout that is difficult but, both sides said, not acrimonious.\n\u201cThe process of his divestiture is going really well considering how complex it is,\u201d Mr. Bastianich said last week. \u201cThe real point of beginning will be when he departs from the company. That\u2019s ground zero. It\u2019s about creating a post-Mario world.\u201d\nWhen Mr. Batali\u2019s name comes up among groups of food professionals over drinks or between sessions at conferences, some say that if any of the men caught in the current wave of sexual harassment scandals can forge a path back, it might be Mr. Batali.\nHe still has legions of fans and colleagues who admire and respect his generosity, culinary knowledge and charisma. Many still post their interpretations of his recipes on Instagram, ask him for selfies on the street or urge his return to \u201cThe Chew\u201d on Facebook. His restaurants continue to attract customers.\nStill, there seems to be no end to late-night television jokes at his expense. His movements around New York are fodder for tabloids and tweets, some suggesting that his past behavior bordered on criminal.\nFew food celebrities want to be connected to him publicly. Privately, some suggest the time has come for a more nuanced approach to replace the scorched-earth policy toward men who have harassed women \u2014 one that allows something resembling redemption.\nBut for Mr. Batali, that door may not be open \u2014 at least professionally.\n\u201cRetire and count yourself lucky,\u201d said Anthony Bourdain, a longtime friend of Mr. Batali\u2019s who has not spoken with him recently. \u201cI say that without malice, or without much malice. I am not forgiving. I can\u2019t get past it. I just cannot and that\u2019s me, someone who really admired him and thought the world of him.\u201d\nOthers, including people who have worked for him, say the absence of his food knowledge and his palate would be a loss. Melissa Rodriguez, who took over in 2017 as the executive chef at Mr. Batali\u2019s most acclaimed restaurant, Del Posto, often asked him to come to the kitchen to taste new dishes and share his advice. \u201cHe\u2019s been nothing but a generous individual to me,\u201d she said.\nMs. Rodriguez said she never considered leaving the company after his treatment of women came to light. \u201cThe biggest concern is for my staff,\u201d she said. \u201cI have a huge staff, and I am not in the business of abandoning people I spend more time with than my family.\u201d\nPeople whose opinion Mr. Batali has sought are counseling him to take it slowly, and to consider whether he and his family want to endure all that would come if he stepped back into the food business.\nMs. Muhlke, a former editor at The New York Times Magazine and Bon App\u00e9tit, said her advice to any accused chef would be the same: \u201cLeave the field,\u201d she said, \u201cand let us do the work needed to build something better.\u201d\nMs. Muhlke would not discuss the details of her February meeting with Mr. Batali, but said \u201cmy advice to these chefs and restaurateurs is that this is not a scandal, this is a paradigm shift. The old \u2018wait it out and return appearing humbled\u2019 prescription no longer applies.\u201d\nChristine C. Quinn, whom Mr. Batali supported during her 2013 run for New York City mayor, is now the president and chief executive of Win, the city\u2019s largest provider of shelter for homeless families. She is a friend of Mr. Batali\u2019s, and one of the advisers he sought out this winter. She, too, told him to take things very slowly.\n\u201cMy advice for him has been since Day 1 to recognize the severity of what has been leveled against him and recognize how absolutely and completely unacceptable his behavior was,\u201d she said.\nIf he does start a new company, she said, he should give the reins to people who can drastically change the culture that both allowed and hid his behavior.\n\u201cI do give Mario a ton of credit for reaching out to people like myself, and not calling for us to stand with him,\u201d Ms. Quinn said. \u201cI think that bodes well.\u201d She, like others who have spoken with him recently, believes that he is slowly coming to understand the impact of his behavior and the reasons it happened, including his relationship with alcohol.\n\u201cI think he is trying to find a way to engage in real redemptive behavior,\u201d Ms. Quinn said, \u201cbut only time will tell.\u201d\nFollow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.
