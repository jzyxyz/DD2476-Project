{"title": "\u2018It Has to Be Perfect\u2019: Putting Out a Yearbook After the Parkland Shooting", "content": "Moments after that terrible Valentine\u2019s Day, the thought crept into the minds of the Aerie yearbook staff at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. They would have to memorialize this tragedy in their pages. Somehow.\nAt first, some students hesitated. \u201cI thought it\u2019d be too much,\u201d said Elizabeth Stout, 17, a senior who is the book\u2019s co-editor in chief, of the staff\u2019s offer to write about the students killed. \u201cI didn\u2019t know at the time if it\u2019d even be right to.\u201d\nFew students who have survived mass shootings in schools have faced the same dilemma. The children at Sandy Hook were too young. Those at Columbine were too far along in the school year.\nAt Stoneman Douglas High, where a former student is accused of killing 17 people in a deadly rampage, editors decided the shooting would not overtake their book. They insisted on preserving a record of the days that came before, the ones filled with the regular markers of high school life: Football games. Club activities. The Sadie Hawkins dance.\nBut they also knew their classmates would keep their book for decades, lugging it with them from dorm rooms to first apartments and showing it to their own children, who would ask about the shooting at Parkland and the lives that had been lost. The book would have to tell that story, too.\nFor several days in the aftermath, the staff allowed The New York Times to follow the group of 37 editors, designers, writers and photographers as they pulled together the book \u2014 choosing the photographs and laying out the pages and making the painstaking decisions on  how to best honor the students and staff who had died. The 452-page book is scheduled to be published in May and distributed to more than 2,500 people.\n\u201cThis,\u201d Elizabeth said, \u201chas to be remembered for the rest of our lives.\u201d\nCramped inside a makeshift yearbook computer lab, Sarah Lerner, 37, the students\u2019 adviser, prodded the photo editor, Rain Valladares, 17, to pick images for the two-page spread that would show the school\u2019s last moments of normalcy before the Feb. 14 shooting.\nThe publisher of the book, which is named for an eagle\u2019s nest \u2014 a reference to the school mascot \u2014 had waived the March 9 deadline. A yearbook adviser in Texas had created a GoFundMe campaign that raised more than $47,000 for the Aerie and The Eagle Eye, the student newspaper.\nSitting in the lab, its walls filled with calendars and lists of deadlines and a copy of the First Amendment, Rain, a junior, said she had found Valentine\u2019s Day photos on her camera when she recovered her belongings on campus, 12 days after the massacre. But she fretted that she had not taken enough that morning.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think I was the only one taking pictures!\u201d she said.\nThe photos show Rain\u2019s friends, some of them clad in festive red, buying carnations at lunchtime, beaming and joking in an outdoor courtyard. When Natasha Martinez, a 17-year-old junior and yearbook photographer, first saw herself smiling in one photo, holding a pink, heart-shaped balloon, she started to cry.\n\u201cI remembered how I felt that morning,\u201d Natasha said. \u201cI was on my way to fourth period, Spanish, and I was like, \u2018Rain!\u2019 It made me really emotional.\u201d\nRain and the staff selected four photographs and set them on the page.\nThe book is organized in chronological order. After Valentine\u2019s Day, the staff added seven new spreads, including one page for each of the dead.\nFor the staff, creating those memorial pages for each of the victims felt personal. Elizabeth assigned herself the page for Carmen Schentrup, 16, who was killed a few feet away from her in their Advanced Placement psychology class. Kyra Parrow, a senior and also co-editor in chief and photo editor, knew another one of the victims, Joaquin Oliver, 17. Isabel Chequer, a 16-year-old junior and photographer, was herself injured, bullets grazing her arm and foot.\n\u201cBeing in journalism, it\u2019s something that you have to talk about,\u201d Aly Sheehy, an 18-year-old senior and captions editor, said of the shooting. \u201cIt\u2019s very therapeutic. It gives us something to do.\u201d\nSeveral staff members, and Ms. Lerner, the adviser, have been seeing counselors. \u201cWords can\u2019t describe what it was,\u201d Isabel said of that day.\nDesigners toggled back and forth between new layouts featuring classmates with their hair dyed blond in memory of Joaquin, or blue in memory of Carmen. Another spread displayed student tattoos commemorating the dead.\nTaylor Ferrante-Markham, 16, a junior on the design staff, got \u201cLove 17\u201d on her left wrist. Elizabeth opted for a heart with \u201cSeventeen\u201d written in script on her rib cage. On the back of her arm, Aly wants 17 stars outlining the constellation Hercules.\n\u201cBecause it means strength,\u201d she said.\nThe staff had picked the 2018 theme \u201cAs One\u201d last year. It was meant to be about high school unity, but has new poignancy after the tragedy, which brought together alumni and the residents of Parkland, and well beyond.\nBesides the memorial pages, the staff also wanted to document the grief and public response in the days that followed the shooting.\n\u201cWhat would be a good caption for the vigil?\u201d Taylor asked.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to do something sappy,\u201d said Thomas Holgate, 17, a junior, looking over Taylor\u2019s shoulder as she stared at the computer screen.\nKyra decided at the Feb. 15 vigil \u2014 on her 18th birthday, \u201cso now I can vote!\u201d \u2014 that to commemorate that moment she would look for quiet images of grief, more artistic than newspaper-like in style.\nShe didn\u2019t want to show photographs of anyone crying, \u201clike the media would,\u201d she said.\nTaylor played with the title of the vigil section. \u201cIs that cheesy?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cAll the love,\u201d Genevieve Martin, a 17-year-old junior and photographer, read aloud. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s too cheesy.\u201d\nTaylor remained unsatisfied.\n\u201cI got it!\u201d she said a few moments later. She typed, \u201cForever loved.\u201d\nThe others applauded. Taylor took a bow in her chair.\nFor the yearbook students, the reminders of the day were everywhere. The glass window in the door to the yearbook lab, the same kind of window that the gunman shattered with his bullets in the freshman building, was still covered with brown construction paper, to keep a potential gunman from being able to see if students were inside. Aly had cut out a rectangular flap to serve as a peephole. Knocks made some students flinch.\nEven as they continued to work on the pages, some students were still figuring out how to talk about what happened. Elizabeth preferred to refer to Feb. 14, or to simply call it \u201cthe event.\u201d\n\u201cI hate calling it \u2018the shooting,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt just feels really insensitive. I just feel like it\u2019s so brutal. Just, harsh.\u201d\nThree hours into an afternoon work session, Taylor leaned back in her chair. \u201cI live in the yearbook room,\u201d she declared. \u201cMy hair is crazy. My stomach is growling. Yet I am here.\u201d\n\u201cIt has to be perfect,\u201d Aly said.", "date": "April 4, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/us/parkland-shooting-yearbook.html", "tags": "shooting \u2018 putting book \u201d taylor school parkland students yearbook perfect staff"}
