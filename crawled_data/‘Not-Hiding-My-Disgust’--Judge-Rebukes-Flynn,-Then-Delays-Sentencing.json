{"title": "\u2018Not Hiding My Disgust\u2019: Judge Rebukes Flynn, Then Delays Sentencing", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A federal judge transformed a seemingly straightforward sentencing hearing for Michael T. Flynn, President Trump\u2019s first national security adviser, into a dramatic showdown on Tuesday, expressing \u201cdisgust\u201d at Mr. Flynn\u2019s efforts to mislead federal investigators and dismissing suggestions he had been treated unfairly.\nIn an extraordinary two-hour session in Federal District Court in Washington, the judge, Emmet G. Sullivan, left no doubt that he viewed Mr. Flynn\u2019s crimes as serious enough to warrant prison time despite a recommendation from prosecutors that he receive a lenient sentence.\nBut Judge Sullivan gave Mr. Flynn the option of postponing his sentencing so he had additional time to prove the value of his cooperation with federal prosecutors. Mr. Flynn promptly took up the offer, delaying a decision on his fate at least until March.\nThe hearing underscored the gravity of the inquiry by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, and the enormous consequences for those ensnared in it.\nMr. Flynn, 59, a retired three-star general whose military career spanned 33 years, pleaded guilty a year ago to lying to F.B.I. agents about his conversations with the Russian ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak, in the month after Mr. Trump\u2019s election. He also acknowledged that he lied in documents he filed with the Justice Department about his lobbying efforts on behalf of the Turkish government before the election.\n\u201cThis is a very serious offense,\u201d Judge Sullivan said. \u201cA high-ranking senior official of the government making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation while on the physical premises of the White House.\u201d\nAt one point, Judge Sullivan asked whether Mr. Flynn could have been charged with additional crimes. Later, he even raised and then dropped the prospect of a case for treason.\nThe judge also walked back another provocative statement he had made, saying he \u201cfelt terrible\u201d that he had wrongly accused Mr. Flynn earlier in the proceeding of selling out his country by simultaneously working as a foreign agent for Turkey and Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser. Mr. Flynn\u2019s work for Turkey ended before he took up his White House post.\nEven though prosecutors had said they would accept a sentence of probation, the judge warned Mr. Flynn that he could not guarantee that outcome. Advisory sentencing guidelines recommend a maximum sentence of six months in prison.\n\u201cI can\u2019t make any guarantees, but I\u2019m not hiding my disgust, my disdain for this criminal offense,\u201d the judge said.\nBefore Tuesday\u2019s hearing, Mr. Flynn and his lawyer, Robert K. Kelner, had implied in presentencing memos that the F.B.I. agents who had interviewed Mr. Flynn may have tricked him by failing to warn him that lying to investigators was a crime.\nIn raising the possibility of misconduct by the investigators, Mr. Flynn and his supporters further fueled efforts by Mr. Trump and some of his supporters to undercut the credibility of the special counsel\u2019s investigation.\nBut under questioning by Judge Sullivan, Mr. Flynn acknowledged that he knew it was a crime to lie to the F.B.I. and he reiterated his guilt.\nThe presentencing memo from Mr. Flynn\u2019s defense team had noted that F.B.I. agents had deliberately decided not to warn Mr. Flynn that lying to them was a criminal offense when they interviewed him in the West Wing on Jan. 24, 2017, four days after Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration.\nThe agents also told Mr. Flynn that notifying the White House Counsel\u2019s Office would be time-consuming and prompt the Justice Department\u2019s involvement.\nThat kicked off a public controversy about the F.B.I.\u2019s conduct, with Mr. Trump insisting the law-enforcement authorities had wrongly cornered Mr. Flynn. It also inspired speculation that Mr. Flynn, whose lawyer at one point discussed a possible pardon with a lawyer for Mr. Trump, was inviting the president to spare him punishment.\nBefore the hearing, Mr. Trump wished Mr. Flynn \u201cgood luck,\u201d saying he had been under \u201ctremendous pressure.\u201d\nEven after it, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said Mr. Flynn had been wronged. \u201cWhat we do know,\u201d she said, \u201cis that the F.B.I. broke standard protocol in a way that they came in and ambushed General Flynn and in the way that they questioned him and in the way that they encouraged him not to have White House Counsel\u2019s Office present.\u201d\nBut in Judge Sullivan\u2019s fourth-floor courtroom, Mr. Kelner said he was merely trying to show that Mr. Flynn had been held to a higher standard than two other people who had pleaded guilty to lying to federal investigators for the special counsel: George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign aide, and Alex van der Zwaan, a Dutch lawyer who worked with Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman. Both men were warned in advance not to lie to investigators and one brought a lawyer to his F.B.I. interview.\nThe judge speedily dismissed that comparison, repeatedly noting that Mr. Flynn was a high-ranking government official who had betrayed the government\u2019s trust by lying \u201cin the White House, in the West Wing.\u201d\nAlthough Judge Sullivan has a reputation for being hard on government misconduct, he found no fault with the conduct of the F.B.I. or prosecutors. He said Mr. Flynn deceived not only F.B.I. agents, but also senior White House officials, who then repeated his lies to the American public.\n\u201cThis is a very serious offense,\u201d he said. \u201cThis case is in a category by itself.\u201d\nAt one point, he asked Brandon L. Van Grack, the lead prosecutor, whether Mr. Flynn was guilty of treason. The question clearly surprised a phalanx of lawyers on Mr. Mueller\u2019s team who were present for the proceedings. Mr. Van Grack at first hesitated to answer, then later said the government had no evidence of treason, and the judge dropped the point.\nSome of Judge Sullivan\u2019s sharpest rebukes involved Mr. Flynn\u2019s lies about his lobbying work for the Turkish government. Wrongly asserting that Mr. Flynn continued to work as an unregistered foreign agent during his short tenure as national security adviser, the judge gestured to the American flag at his side and declared: \u201cI mean, arguably, that undermines everything this flag over here stands for. Arguably, you sold your country out.\u201d\nFor Mr. Flynn, who once led supporters of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign in chants of \u201clock her up\u201d against Hillary Clinton, more uncertainty lies ahead. Although prosecutors said they had gleaned almost all they could from him, Mr. Kelner told the judge that Mr. Flynn wanted to postpone his sentencing to put himself in the best position \u201cto eke out the last modicum of cooperation.\u201d\nUnder his plea deal, Mr. Flynn met with investigators and prosecutors for the special counsel\u2019s office 19 times. In doing so, he became an early cooperator in an investigation that has spun off criminal cases now in the hands of other federal prosecutors.\nThe special counsel\u2019s office is investigating whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice, including by asking James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director at the time, to end the investigation into Mr. Flynn in early 2017. It is unclear whether Mr. Flynn knew about the president\u2019s reported attempt to intervene on his behalf, or whether he has offered any insights on that front.\nProsecutors acknowledged that Mr. Flynn had helped the government secure an indictment in Northern Virginia against two of his former business associates for violating foreign lobbying rules. Prosecutors said the two men conspired with Turkey in 2016 to pressure the United States to expel a rival of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\nAlthough he could have faced additional charges in that case that carried up to 15 years in prison, prosecutors said, Mr. Flynn was being treated only as a witness.\nHow exactly Mr. Flynn\u2019s lies hampered the special counsel\u2019s inquiry into Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election remained, for now, unclear. So did the precise reasons he lied.\nJudge Sullivan explicitly warned Mr. Flynn that even if he could show further evidence of how much he had helped the special counsel\u2019s office and the Justice Department, he might still sentence him to prison.\nAs Mr. Flynn left the federal courthouse, he faced a divided and raucous crowd in which some people yelled \u201cU.S.A.\u201d while others chanted \u201cLock him up.\u201d", "date": "Dec. 18, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/us/politics/michael-flynn-sentencing.html", "tags": "prosecutors sentencing \u2018 hiding judge counsel \u201d sullivan flynn rebukes delays disgust said"}
