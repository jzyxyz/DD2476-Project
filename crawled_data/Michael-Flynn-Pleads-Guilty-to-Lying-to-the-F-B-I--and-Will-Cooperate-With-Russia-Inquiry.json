{"title": "Michael Flynn Pleads Guilty to Lying to the F.B.I. and Will Cooperate With Russia Inquiry", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, pleaded guilty on Friday to lying to the F.B.I. about conversations with the Russian ambassador last December, becoming the first senior White House official to cut a cooperation deal in the special counsel\u2019s wide-ranging inquiry into election interference.\nMr. Flynn\u2019s discussions with Sergey I. Kislyak, the Russian ambassador, were part of a coordinated effort by Mr. Trump\u2019s aides to create foreign policy before they were in power, documents released as part of Mr. Flynn\u2019s plea agreement show. Their efforts undermined the existing policy of President Barack Obama and flouted a warning from a senior Obama administration official to stop meddling in foreign affairs before the inauguration.\nThe documents do not disclose what Mr. Trump knew about Mr. Flynn\u2019s discussions. But in at least one instance, prosecutors say, Mr. Flynn was directed by a \u201cvery senior member\u201d of the presidential transition team to discuss a United Nations resolution. Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers believe that unnamed aide was Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and close adviser, Jared Kushner, according to a lawyer briefed on the matter.\nThe transition team was led by Vice President Mike Pence. Its top members included Mr. Kushner; Reince Priebus, Mr. Trump\u2019s first chief of staff; and K.T. McFarland, who was Mr. Flynn\u2019s deputy and was later appointed to be the ambassador to Singapore. Mr. Flynn spoke to Ms. McFarland about another of his conversations with Mr. Kislyak, according to the lawyer.\nMr. Flynn\u2019s decision to plead guilty to lying to investigators about those conversations marked a significant new phase in the investigation of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, and a politically treacherous development for the president and his closest aides, whose activities in the West Wing are being scrutinized by F.B.I. agents, lawmakers, federal prosecutors and the media.\nThe admissions by Mr. Flynn have the potential to reshape the public\u2019s understanding of what the president\u2019s associates said and did in the days after Mr. Trump\u2019s unexpected election victory. And they suggest that prosecutors now have a cooperative source of information from inside the Oval Office during the administration\u2019s chaotic first weeks.\nMr. Flynn\u2019s plea deal could deeply undercut the claims made in January by Mr. Trump and his aides that they were misled by Mr. Flynn about his discussion with Russians regarding sanctions imposed on Moscow by the Obama administration over the election interference. In fact, the documents say multiple members of the team coordinated the specifics of Mr. Flynn\u2019s outreach to Russia and knew that the conversations were about sanctions.\nMr. Flynn\u2019s agreement also provided new context for Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to get F.B.I. officials to back off their investigation of Mr. Flynn.\nJames B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, has said that the president asked him to shut down the investigation one day after Mr. Flynn was fired in February. \u201cI hope you can let this go,\u201d the president said, according to congressional testimony by Mr. Comey.\nThe information provided by Mr. Flynn, who promised to provide prosecutors with information on \u201cany and all matters,\u201d suggests one possible motivation for the president\u2019s efforts to shut down the Flynn investigation: to avoid revealing the deep involvement of his top transition officials in Mr. Flynn\u2019s discussions with Mr. Kislyak.\nIn May, the president fired Mr. Comey as well and said the Russia investigation was on his mind at the time. Mr. Mueller is investigating whether Mr. Trump\u2019s firings of Mr. Comey or Mr. Flynn amount to obstruction of justice.\nMr. Trump made no public comments on Friday, though Mr. Flynn\u2019s plea provided an awkward backdrop for a closed-door holiday reception for members of the press corps at the White House.\nTy Cobb, the president\u2019s lawyer dealing with the Russia inquiry, played down the potential impact of Mr. Flynn\u2019s deal, saying that Mr. Flynn served only briefly in the administration and had pleaded guilty to just a single count of lying to the F.B.I.\n\u201cNothing about the guilty plea or the charge implicates anyone other than Mr. Flynn,\u201d Mr. Cobb said in a statement.\nBut while the court documents released on Friday show no direct evidence of collusion with Russia, the special counsel\u2019s filings so far paint a damning portrait of Mr. Trump\u2019s associates. His former campaign chairman, two other campaign aides and his former national security adviser have now all been charged with felonies.\nIn a statement, Mr. Flynn, 58, denied \u201cfalse accusations of \u2018treason,\u2019\u201d but said that he had agreed to cooperate with prosecutors, who are examining whether Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign colluded with Russians during the election and whether anyone sought to cover it up.\n\u201cI recognize that the actions I acknowledged in court today were wrong, and, through my faith in God, I am working to set things right,\u201d Mr. Flynn said. \u201cMy guilty plea and agreement to cooperate with the special counsel\u2019s office reflect a decision I made in the best interests of my family and of our country. I accept full responsibility for my actions.\u201d\nFriday\u2019s 45-minute hearing in federal court in Washington was a humiliating moment for Mr. Flynn, a decorated Army general who had risen to lead the Defense Intelligence Agency but was fired by Mr. Obama before joining the Trump campaign.\nDressed in a crisp gray suit, Mr. Flynn arrived at the courtroom with his wife, holding hands. They occasionally traded glances, and her legs trembled before prosecutors laid out their case that Mr. Flynn had repeatedly lied to investigators about his dealings with Russia and his lobbying on behalf of the Turkish government.\nMr. Flynn\u2019s plea agreement requires his full cooperation. He agreed to take a polygraph and, if asked, to participate in covert law enforcement activities. Such undercover activities are unlikely, however, since the plea agreement was filed publicly.\nProsecutors said they would delay Mr. Flynn\u2019s sentencing, a sign that their investigation was not over and that they had not exhausted Mr. Flynn\u2019s cooperation. Lying to the F.B.I. carries a penalty of up to five years in prison, but court documents indicate Mr. Flynn faces a likely sentence of zero to six months in prison.\nBecause he pleaded guilty to lying, Mr. Flynn hurt his credibility as a witness if he ever offered evidence against someone else at trial. But Mr. Flynn\u2019s cooperation could still be valuable in guiding Mr. Mueller\u2019s understanding of the campaign\u2019s contacts with Russia, even if he cannot directly implicate anyone in a crime.\nAccording to prosecutors, on Dec. 22, Mr. Flynn discussed with Mr. Kislyak an upcoming United Nations Security Council vote on whether to condemn Israel\u2019s building of settlements. At the time, the Obama administration was preparing to allow a Security Council vote on the matter.\nMr. Mueller\u2019s investigators have learned through witnesses and documents that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel asked the Trump transition team to lobby other countries to help Israel, according to two people briefed on the inquiry. Investigators have learned that Mr. Flynn and Mr. Kushner took the lead in those efforts.\nMr. Mueller\u2019s team has emails that show Mr. Flynn saying he would work to kill the vote, the people briefed on the matter said.\nMr. Flynn also spoke to Mr. Kislyak on Dec. 29, according to court documents, about the sanctions against Russia announced that day. He had consulted with Ms. McFarland about the matter. She was with other members of the team at Mr. Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, the court documents revealed, \u201cto discuss what, if anything, to communicate to the Russian ambassador about the U.S. sanctions.\u201d\nMr. Flynn asked Mr. Kislyak that Moscow refrain from escalating the situation, and Mr. Kislyak said Russia \u201chad chosen to moderate its response,\u201d the documents said. The following day, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said Moscow would not retaliate against the United States for the sanctions.\nAmerican intelligence agencies had grown so concerned about Mr. Flynn\u2019s communications with Mr. Kislyak and false accounts that he provided to Mr. Pence that he was interviewed by F.B.I. agents at the White House four days after the president was sworn into office. Sally Q. Yates, the acting attorney general, warned the White House that its national security adviser might be compromised by the Russians.\nEven before Mr. Trump said he would appoint Mr. Flynn to the post, questions swirled around his connections to foreign governments, particularly a dinner he was paid to attend in Moscow in 2015 when he sat at the same table as Mr. Putin.\nMr. Flynn had also formed a consulting group after he left the Obama administration that led to inquiries into questionable lobbying for foreign governments, including the Turkish government.\nInvestigators working for the special counsel have questioned witnesses about whether Mr. Flynn was secretly paid by Turkish officials during the campaign. After he left the White House, Mr. Flynn disclosed that the Turkish government had paid him more than a half-million dollars to represent its interests in a dispute with the United States.\nProsecutors did not charge Mr. Flynn with crimes related to his work with the Turkish government. But in documents, they made clear that they have evidence that Mr. Flynn \u201cmade materially false statements and omissions\u201d in his federal filings about that lobbying work.\nMr. Flynn\u2019s son, Michael Flynn Jr., was intimately involved with his father\u2019s undisclosed lobbying efforts. The son has not been charged with a crime and it is not clear whether his possible legal exposure put extra pressure on his father to plead guilty. Barry Coburn, a lawyer for Mr. Flynn Jr., declined to comment.", "date": "Dec. 1, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/01/us/politics/michael-flynn-guilty-russia-investigation.html", "tags": "prosecutors cooperate guilty f.b.i inquiry pleads documents lying \u201d flynn michael russia said"}
