Putin of Russia and offered to meet Iran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani, without any preconditions.\nDuring those same five days, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on a Russian bank accused of helping North Korea with weapons-related activities. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo listed stringent preconditions for any engagement with Iran. And the administration\u2019s top intelligence and law enforcement officials vowed to combat Russian interference in the midterm elections, while Senate Republicans pushed a bill that would impose harsh new sanctions on Moscow.\nThere is Mr. Trump\u2019s foreign policy, and then there is the foreign policy of the rest of the Trump administration, backed by the Republican Party. This week, the two were openly at odds with each other. Be it Russia, NATO, Iran or North Korea, Mr. Trump\u2019s staff and his party projected a radically different message than the president himself.\n\u201cThere is a clear dissonance between what the president says and what his administration says,\u201d said Vali R. Nasr, the dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, \u201cand it has been noticed by allies and adversaries around the world.\u201d\nNowhere were these differences more jarring than in how the Trump administration and Republicans responded to the latest concerns that the Russian government is plotting to interfere in the midterm elections much as it did during the 2016 presidential election.\nOn Thursday, the White House produced an array of top officials to dramatize the threat and explain the nation\u2019s countermeasures. The president was conspicuously absent.\n\u201cOur democracy itself is in the cross hairs,\u201d said the secretary of homeland security, Kirstjen Nielsen. \u201cIt goes beyond the elections,\u201d said the director of national intelligence, Dan Coats. \u201cThis is a threat we need to take extremely seriously,\u201d said the F.B.I. director, Christopher Wray.\nOn Capitol Hill, Republicans joined with Democrats to propose additional sanctions on Russia that Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, described as \u201cthe most hard-hitting ever imposed.\u201d\nThe bill also strikes at Russia\u2019s efforts to fracture the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, requiring a two-thirds vote of the Senate for the United States to withdraw from the alliance. That language is a direct rebuke to Mr. Trump, who regularly derides the alliance as a collection of deadbeats, with no benefit to the United States.\nYet at a rally in Pennsylvania hours later, Mr. Trump dismissed the special counsel\u2019s investigation of Russian interference as a \u201choax\u201d that was impeding his efforts to nurture a constructive relationship with the Russian president. \u201cI got along great with Putin,\u201d he said of their recent meeting in Helsinki, Finland. As for NATO\u2019s members, he said, they were delinquent and in need of a stern lecture about paying their bills.\n\u201cIt was important that the national security team spoke en masse and forcefully on Russian aggression towards our elections,\u201d said R. Nicholas Burns, a former ambassador to NATO who served under Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. \u201cBut Putin will not be deterred on this issue, or Crimea, or the nerve agent attack until he hears Trump say it forcefully and convincingly.\u201d\n\u201cUntil then,\u201d Mr. Burns said, \u201che will view Trump as weak.\u201d\nAdministration officials said Mr. Trump directed his national security team to hold the briefing on Thursday to underline how seriously he takes the threat of election interference. They said his softer language \u2014 whether about Russia or North Korea \u2014 merely reflects his conviction that he should cultivate a positive relationship with the leaders of those countries.\nAsked why Mr. Trump rarely, if ever, sounds the alarm about Russia\u2019s election meddling, the national security adviser, John R. Bolton, told reporters: \u201cThe president has made it abundantly clear to anybody who has responsibility in this area that he cares deeply about it and that he expects them to do their jobs to their fullest ability.\u201d\nThe dissonance between Mr. Trump and his staff extends to countries like Iran, with which neither he nor his aides are seeking a warm relationship. The president\u2019s declaration that he would meet Iran\u2019s leaders \u201canytime they want\u201d \u2014 without preconditions \u2014 came just as other officials, including Mr. Pompeo, were hardening their language toward the country.\nMr. Pompeo quickly listed three preconditions for engagement: that the Iranians \u201cdemonstrate a commitment to make fundamental changes in how they treat their own people, reduce their malign behavior\u201d and \u201center into a nuclear agreement that actually prevents proliferation.\u201d\nFor aides like Mr. Pompeo or Nikki R. Haley, the American ambassador to the United Nations, there could be another reason for the disconnect with Mr. Trump: they harbor their own long-term political ambitions and do not want to run afoul of traditional Republican constituencies.\nCozying up to Iran or Russia does not play well with mainstream Republicans, so it is perhaps little surprise that Mr. Pompeo, a former Tea Party congressman from Kansas, would stake out a hawkish position on both countries.\nMs. Haley, a former Republican governor of South Carolina whose name is often floated for national office, seized on reports Friday that Russia had given work permits to laborers from North Korea \u2014 something that it denies, but if true, would violate United Nations resolutions.\nAdministration officials have long argued that foreign leaders should focus on the policies, not the president\u2019s Twitter posts or offhand statements. The Treasury Department on Friday, for example, blacklisted a Russian bank accused of processing millions of dollars in transactions for North Korean businesses, in violation of United Nations sanctions \u2014 one of dozens of such measures against both countries.\nBut those incremental steps tend to pale next to Mr. Trump\u2019s breakthrough moves. Even if his aides are consistently hawkish on Russia or North Korea, Mr. Trump\u2019s solicitous approach in Helsinki with Mr. Putin or in Singapore, where he met Mr. Kim, sets the tone.\nAfter Singapore, Mr. Trump declared that he and Mr. Kim had solved the North Korean nuclear crisis \u2014 an assessment he has not abandoned even after intelligence reports that the country was still producing nuclear fuel and building ballistic missiles.\nOn Thursday, Mr. Trump thanked Mr. Kim for returning the remains of American soldiers killed in the Korean War. \u201cI am not at all surprised that you took this kind action,\u201d he said on Twitter. \u201cAlso, thank you for your nice letter \u2014 I look forward to seeing you soon!\u201d\nThis has put Mr. Pompeo, the president\u2019s chief negotiator with North Korea, in a devilish position. He told reporters Friday that North Korea\u2019s latest moves violated its United Nations obligations and underscored how difficult it will be to rid the country of its nuclear weapons.\n\u201cThe North Koreans have been conditioned by the president\u2019s habit of ignoring his officials\u2019 hard line positions,\u201d said Daniel R. Russel, a former assistant secretary of state for East Asian affairs. \u201cAs a result, they only want to deal with Trump, who has proved so far to be an easy mark.\u201d\n\u201cDealing with North Korea is never easy,\u201d he said, \u201cbut this makes Pompeo\u2019s task exponentially more difficult.\u201d", "date": "Aug. 3, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/03/us/politics/trump-foreign-policy.html", "tags": "policy administration president \u201d trump russia foreign north \u2014 korea"}
