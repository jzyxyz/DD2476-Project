{"title": "Amazon Gets Heat Over Holocaust Denial Books", "content": "Amazon is coming under fire in Europe for peddling books that claim the Holocaust never happened amid a resurgence of anti-Semitism and other hate speech.\u00a0\nHolocaust denial is a crime in France, Italy and Germany with penalties that can include prison. Amazon removed several books from its websites in those countries following an investigation by the London Sunday Times that found dozens of books denying the Holocaust for sale. Most of the books are self-published.\nBooks included \u201cThe Myth of the Extermination of Jews\u201d and \u201cHolocaust: The Greatest Lie Ever Told.\u201d Most of the titles are still available on Amazon\u2019s sites in the U.K. and U.S., where Holocaust denial is not a crime.\nA spokesman for the Holocaust Educational Trust\u00a0attacked the books as anti-Semitic and called Amazon\u2019s sales of the books \u201cshocking.\u201d\n\u201cThe Holocaust was one of the most well-documented and researched periods in history, yet over 70 years later, there are still those who deliberately deny, denigrate and belittle the memory of the Holocaust,\u201d spokeswoman Karen Pollock told the London Times. \u201cHolocaust denial is highly offensive and the intent is anti-Semitism, pure and simple.\u201d\nGideon Falter of the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism in Britain complained to the Independent that Amazon standards \u201cprohibit the sale of \u2018offensive material\u2019 but these titles are sold by Amazon.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cAnybody searching Amazon for books about the Holocaust, including children working on school projects, will inevitably be shown Amazon\u2019s squalid cesspool of neo-Nazi titles.\u201d\nHolocaust deniers are enjoying a new popularity amid the rise of extreme nationalism. The bizarre and ugly phenomenon is explored in the 2016 film \u201cDenial.\u201d The movie stars Rachel Weisz as the real-life Jewish author Deborah Lipstadt, who was sued for libel by Holocaust denier David Irving. She was forced to prove in court that the Holocaust happened. Irving lost the case.\u00a0\nThe new pressure on Amazon comes amid demands that social networking companies such as Facebook and Twitter crack down on an increase of\u00a0hate speech online.\nAmazon has not made any comment about the controversy or why the company removed the books from certain European websites.", "date": "\n02/13/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/amazon-holocaust-denial_n_58a151afe4b094a129ec9b82", "tags": "heat hate anti-semitism holocaust books denial \u201d gets amazon amid happened"}
