{"title": "Trump and Republicans Seek to Turn the Tables in Post-Mueller Washington", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump and his Republican allies went on the offensive on Monday, vowing to pursue and even punish those responsible for the Russia investigation now that the special counsel has wrapped up without implicating him or his campaign in a criminal conspiracy to influence the 2016 election.\nMr. Trump, grim faced and simmering with anger, denounced adversaries who have pounded him for two years over Russian election interference, calling them \u201ctreasonous\u201d people who are guilty of \u201cevil\u201d deeds and should be investigated themselves. \u201cThose people will certainly be looked at,\u201d he said.\nOn Capitol Hill, the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee announced he would do just that while also calling for a new special counsel to look at the origins of the last one. White House officials and Republican lawmakers demanded the resignation of a Democratic committee chairman investigating the Russia matter, and Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election campaign lobbied television networks to blackball Democrats who advanced the collusion theory.\nThe assertive posture indicated that despite initial calls by Republican leaders to move on after the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, the president and his supporters were intent on turning the tables on his foes. While Democrats saw the actions as revenge, Mr. Trump\u2019s defenders said they wanted accountability for a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d that has consumed half of his term.\n\u201cThere are a lot of people out there that have done some very, very evil things, very bad things, I would say some treasonous things against our country,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking at them for a long time,\u201d he added, \u201cand I\u2019m saying why haven\u2019t they been looked at? They lied to Congress, many of them, you know who they are. They\u2019ve done so many evil things.\u201d\nThe approach, if it lasts, contrasts with those of other presidents who survived major scandals. After the Iran-contra affair, President Ronald Reagan happily dropped the subject and focused on arms control talks with the Soviet Union and other issues. After being acquitted at his Senate impeachment trial, President Bill Clinton was just as eager to move on to Social Security and other initiatives.\nBut Mr. Trump and his allies on Monday sought to put his adversaries on the defensive and cement the view that Mr. Mueller\u2019s report represents complete vindication. Mr. Mueller found no conspiracy between Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia, but he pointedly declined to exonerate the president on obstruction of justice, according to a Justice Department letter to lawmakers on Sunday.\nMr. Mueller\u2019s report has yet to be released, so it remains unknown whether it includes damning new details that question the actions of Mr. Trump or his associates, even if they do not represent a crime. Six House Democratic committee chairmen sent a letter on Monday to Attorney General William P. Barr demanding he provide them the full report by next Tuesday.\nMr. Trump said on Monday that releasing the report \u201cwouldn\u2019t bother me at all,\u201d but Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, later in the day blocked a nonbinding resolution \u2014 already passed unanimously by the House \u2014 calling for the report to be made public, arguing that Mr. Barr should decide.\nDemocrats struggled to find a path ahead, with some urging the party to turn its attention to policy differences with Mr. Trump. Speaker Nancy Pelosi has credited such a strategy with fueling last year\u2019s midterm election victories and said she opposed trying to impeach the president \u201cunless there\u2019s something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan.\u201d She plans to unveil a health care plan on Tuesday.\n\u201cThe report vindicates Nancy Pelosi\u2019s judgment of proceeding with deliberateness and caution and focusing on issues that we can deliver for the American people,\u201d said Representative Ro Khanna, Democrat of California and a leading liberal voice in the House.\nRepublicans faced their own choice. After two years shadowed by Mr. Mueller, Mr. Trump has the opportunity to reset his presidency, but as he strode with new confidence into a post-Mueller world, he appeared more intent on payback.\nStephen K. Bannon, his former chief strategist, predicted that Mr. Trump \u201cis going to go full animal\u201d now that Mr. Mueller has wrapped up. The president, Mr. Bannon told Yahoo News, will \u201ccome off the chains\u201d and use the findings to \u201cbludgeon\u201d his opposition.\nOthers close to the White House urged the president not to do that but instead focus on his own agenda. \u201cThe president has a unique historical opportunity, while in his re-election cycle, to reconnect to millions of Americans who have assumed he was guilty of serious wrongdoing, due to the unrelenting irresponsible media coverage of fake collusion,\u201d said Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union.\nSenator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who golfed with Mr. Trump in Florida last weekend, agreed. \u201cMy advice to the president, for whatever it\u2019s worth, is that you are probably stronger today than you have been at any time in your presidency,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cAnd if I were you, Mr. President, I would focus on what\u2019s next for the country.\u201d\nInstead, Mr. Graham said, the president should leave it to him to go after the authors of the Russia investigation. As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Mr. Graham announced that he would investigate anti-Trump bias at the F.B.I. and Justice Department and called on Mr. Barr to appoint a second special counsel to study the same issues.\n\u201cBy any reasonable standard, Mr. Mueller fully investigated the Trump campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cYou cannot say that about the other side of the story.\u201d\nMr. Trump\u2019s lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, echoed that, saying that the origin of the Russia investigation should be examined. \u201cWho made it up?\u201d he said on Fox News. \u201cIt had to come from somewhere. It didn\u2019t just come out of thin air. I want to know who did it, who paid for it, who fueled it.\u201d\nOther Republicans piled on Democrats who have vocally asserted wrongdoing between the Trump campaign and Russia, taking aim specifically at Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the outspoken chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.\n\u201cHas anyone heard from slimy Adam #fullofschiff Schiff today?\u201d Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s eldest son, wrote on Twitter. \u201cI mean it must be embarrassing to have have spent the last 2 years as the leader of the tinfoil hat brigade and have it all come crashing down so quick.\u201d\nKellyanne Conway, the president\u2019s counselor, and Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House Republican leader, called on Mr. Schiff to resign as chairman.\n\u201cSchiff has met the standard that he has imposed on other members of Congress of when they should step back from their positions,\u201d Mr. McCarthy told Politico. \u201cHe has exceeded that standard, and there is no question he should step down from the intel chairmanship.\u201d\nThe president\u2019s re-election campaign sent a memo to television producers naming Mr. Schiff and several other Democrats that it argued had \u201cmade outlandish, false claims\u201d and should therefore be reconsidered before being booked again.\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee moved to use the special counsel\u2019s conclusions against vulnerable Democrats who had accused Mr. Trump of colluding with Russia. The committee reached back for a July 2017 tweet from Representative Joe Cunningham of South Carolina, who won one of the most Republican seats now held by a Democrat.\n\u201cNow it\u2019s time for Cunningham to put his big boy pants on and apologize to President Trump and his constituents for peddling dangerous conspiracy theories that divided the country,\u201d the committee said in a statement.\nAs it happened, the one person Mr. Trump made a point of not going after on Monday was Mr. Mueller, who has been on the receiving end of scalding presidential Twitter blasts for more than a year. Asked by a reporter if Mr. Mueller acted honorably, Mr. Trump said: \u201cYes, he did. Yes, he did.\u201d\nCongressional Democrats were not backing off, promising to push ahead with an array of investigations into Mr. Trump, his businesses and his policies, while arguing that Mr. Mueller\u2019s scope was relatively narrow and that without seeing all of Mr. Mueller\u2019s evidence, there was no reason to adjust course.\nSenator Mazie K. Hirono, Democrat of Hawaii and a member of Mr. Graham\u2019s committee, accused Republicans of taking a narrow-minded victory lap.\n\u201cThe pattern of the Republicans is very clear that they continue to play up to the president,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is a pattern. They don\u2019t want to look into his activities. They make excuses to him. They support everything he does and it continues.\u201d\nMr. Schiff, for his part, said he \u201cwould not be intimidated\u201d by the Republicans and stood by his comments about public evidence of collusion. He did concede that after reading Mr. Mueller\u2019s full report he would probably need to reorient the Intelligence Committee\u2019s inquiry into possible foreign influence over the president.\n\u201cWe have a constitutional obligation to make sure that the president and the people are not compromised by a foreign power, and that\u2019s what we intend to do,\u201d he said.", "date": "March 25, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/25/us/politics/republicans-mueller-revenge.html", "tags": "washington \u201c mueller committee trump turn seek tables post-mueller republican house republicans said"}
