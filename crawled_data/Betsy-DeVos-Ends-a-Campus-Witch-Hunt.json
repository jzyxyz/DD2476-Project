{"title": "Betsy DeVos Ends a Campus Witch Hunt", "content": "Suppose you\u2019re the kind of thoughtful liberal who concluded from Donald Trump\u2019s election that you\u2019ve been living in a bubble and need to better understand the causes of America\u2019s distemper. Suppose, too, that you have friends who voted for Trump \u2014 and who you know for a fact are neither bigots nor buffoons.\nWhy are they so angry? How could they feel so desperate, politically speaking, to cast their ballots for him?\nFor a sense of the answer, look no further than Education Secretary Betsy DeVos\u2019s announcement Thursday that her department would revisit the Obama administration\u2019s Title IX guidelines on campus sexual assault. The guidelines, she said, had \u201cfailed too many students\u201d by radically curtailing due process. She\u2019s right.\nIn April 2011, the department\u2019s Office of Civil Rights sent a \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter to campus administrators effectively demanding new procedures when it came to handling sexual assault cases. The letter arrived without the usual \u201cnotice-and-comment\u201d period that is supposed to precede formal rule making. Instead, as Lara Bazelon notes in Politico, \u201chundreds of schools were placed under federal investigation for failing to be tougher in handling allegations of campus sexual assault.\u201d\nCampus administrators got the message. Henceforth, the accused would be judged on a \u201cpreponderance of evidence\u201d basis to determine guilt, sometimes known as the \u201c50 percent plus a feather\u201d standard. Accusers would be able to appeal \u201cnot guilty\u201d verdicts. Efforts would be made to spare the accuser from being faced with direct cross-examination by the accused.\nOne way to think about the 2011 letter is as an effort to combat the scourge of campus rape. That\u2019s a laudable goal, even if evidence of its epidemic proportions is sketchy and good numbers are all but impossible to come by. In 2015, 89 percent of colleges and universities reported zero incidents of rape.\nBut another way to think about the letter is as Exhibit A in the overreach of an administrative state pursuing a narrow ideological agenda through methods both lawless and aggressive.\nThus, a letter posing as mere \u201cguidance\u201d could acquire the force of holy writ because no campus administrator was going to risk his federal funds for the sake of holding dear the innocence of students accused of rape. A standard of evidence usually applied in civil cases could be used to impose serious sanctions on students for sexual acts of a criminal nature. The Fifth Amendment protection against double jeopardy could be ignored because campus tribunals aren\u2019t courts of law. So, too, could the Sixth Amendment right of the accused \u201cto be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d\nThis wasn\u2019t some theoretical exercise. \u201cAfter my son received notice that he had been accused of rape I went to the top-tier university he attended and in my first meeting was told he should leave voluntarily because there was no possibility that he could ever be found innocent,\u201d one father wrote me. (I omit his name so as not to stigmatize the family.)\nHis son passed two polygraph exams attesting to his innocence. It made no difference. \u201cI was na\u00efve and thought there was no way this could happen in the United States,\u201d the father added. \u201cNow my son is forever marked as having committed a sexual assault.\u201d\nKimberly Lau, an attorney at Warshaw Burstein, has represented over 100 defendants in campus sexual-assault cases. She described to me sitting with a client in a campus tribunal where she was forbidden from speaking. The accuser appeared via Skype but did not face the accused.\n\u201cThey are requiring these 19- or 20-year-old kids to advocate for themselves,\u201d she says. \u201cThey have to speak about a very private event to three strangers, generally much older. Their whole education is at stake. You can\u2019t expect even an innocent person to feel comfortable in that situation.\u201d\nI asked Lau how many of her cases were ultimately resolved through exoneration or a financial settlement. She estimated about 90 percent. But that, she adds, is the good fortune only of those who can afford high-powered representation. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine how many people can\u2019t afford it and don\u2019t even try.\u201d\nThe travesties of justice carried out under the new Title IX guidelines have been the subject of some excellent books and superb journalism, none better than Emily Yoffe\u2019s in The Atlantic. And yet the response of the progressive left has been indifferent or worse.\nOn Thursday, the social activist Amy Siskind tweeted that the conservative writer David French should \u201cSTFU with your hackneyed due process talking point\u201d after the latter pointed out that \u201ccampus kangaroo courts violate fundamental rights.\u201d\nSiskind\u2019s activism revolves mainly around pointing out the Trump administration\u2019s creeping authoritarianism. Yet Trump\u2019s election was itself a response to the creeping authoritarianism of his predecessor. Liberals trying to grasp what happened last November would be well served revisiting this ugly saga, and perhaps even murmuring a word of thanks that Secretary DeVos means to bring it to a close.", "date": "Sept. 8, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/08/opinion/betsy-devos-title-iv.html", "tags": "letter hunt devos accused \u201d campus could betsy ends sexual cases witch"}
