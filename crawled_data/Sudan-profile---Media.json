{"title": "Sudan profile - Media", "content": "Sudanese broadcasting is highly restricted and state TV and radio reflect government policy. Pre-censorship has been used to ensure that the news reflects official views.\nSudan ranks among the bottom 10 countries in the Reporters Without Borders (RSF) annual press freedom index.\nRSF says the government is \"exceptionally hostile\" to media freedom. The national intelligence agency has clamped down on non-state and opposition-leaning newspapers, often by seizing their print runs.\nSatellite dishes are a common sight in affluent areas and pan-Arab TV stations are popular.\nRadio is an important news medium. The state runs the main networks and there is a handful of private FM radios - most of them focusing on entertainment or Islam.\nNetherlands-based Radio Dabanga aims to reach listeners in Darfur via shortwave. Radio Tamazuj, also operating from the Netherlands, targets audiences on the Sudan-South Sudan border.\nSudan had 11.8 million internet users by the end of 2018, comprising around 28% of the population (InternetWorldStats). \nFreedom House says the internet is a relatively open space for free expression, but that economic deterioration has resulted in restrictive online access costs. \nCurbs on traditional media mean that Sudanese citizens often rely on online outlets and social media for uncensored news. WhatsApp is a popular online destination.\nSudan filters online content that is deemed to be blasphemous or morally damaging, says Freedom House. The state can also block any site that it believes poses a threat to national security.\nActivists and ordinary internet users have faced arrest for their social media activities. A 2018 cyber crime law introduced penalties for spreading fake news online.
