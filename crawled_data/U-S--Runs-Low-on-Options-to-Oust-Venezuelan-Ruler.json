{"title": "U.S. Runs Low on Options to Oust Venezuelan Ruler", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Hours before he pulled American diplomats from Venezuela, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo confronted the growing crisis in the country by blaming not only its embattled ruler, but also a broader menace: socialism.\nHis diagnosis echoed President Trump\u2019s line of attack against potential Democratic rivals in 2020, and there is little question that the far-left ideology of Venezuela\u2019s government shares some responsibility for the dysfunction that has thrown the country into chaos.\nBut Mr. Pompeo\u2019s broadside against President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro also obscured the fact that the United States had just about run out of options to achieve its goal in Caracas: a peaceful change of power.\n\u201cNicol\u00e1s Maduro promised Venezuelans a better life in a socialist paradise,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said on Monday. \u201cAnd he delivered on the socialism part, which has proved time and time again is a recipe for economic ruin.\u201d\nThe United States has imposed sanctions to cut off Venezuela\u2019s oil revenues and against banks, including one in Russia. It has canceled the visas of officials in the Maduro government and talked to nations about taking in others who might seek asylum or a safe haven. And it maintains that \u201call options are on the table\u201d \u2014 even while assuring allies that military intervention, of the kind that the United States has had a long and ugly history of carrying out in Latin America, is not really being considered.\nBut Mr. Maduro remains, to the surprise of many in the Trump administration.\nNow, Mr. Trump faces the same problem that his predecessor, Barack Obama, confronted after saying in 2012 that President Bashar al-Assad of Syria would be severely punished if he used chemical weapons \u2014 the dangers of making a tough declaration that the United States is unwilling or unable to enforce.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough situation with no clear end in sight, and momentum appears to be moving in the wrong direction,\u201d said Fernando Cutz, a former senior White House official on Latin America policy in the Obama and Trump administrations.\nThe move to vacate the United States Embassy in Caracas was a significant setback for the Trump administration. American officials had previously vowed to keep diplomats in Venezuela to legitimize Juan Guaid\u00f3, the opposition leader who declared himself the interim president in January.\nThe decision was difficult for Mr. Pompeo to explain.\nThe diplomats in Caracas \u201chave done great work,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said in a television interview on Tuesday in Houston, where he was attending an energy conference. \u201cBut it was time for them to come back. Their security is always paramount. And it\u2019s just gotten very difficult.\u201d\nMr. Pompeo announced the decision just minutes before midnight on Monday. The withdrawal, he said on Twitter, reflected Venezuela\u2019s \u201cdeteriorating situation\u201d and the belief that the American diplomats\u2019 presence \u201chas become a constraint on U.S. policy.\u201d There was no mention of those concerns just hours earlier at a briefing on Venezuela to reporters at the State Department.\nMr. Maduro has held onto power and the support of his military leaders, despite the hopes and expectations of opposition leaders and the Trump administration.\nLast month, Mr. Guaid\u00f3 and American officials tried to persuade senior military officers to abandon Mr. Maduro by sending convoys with food and medical supplies overland into Venezuela, forcing a choice between blocking the aid for civilians or defecting from the army. They chose to block the convoys, reinforcing Mr. Maduro\u2019s rule and weakening the efforts of Mr. Guaid\u00f3 and the United States.\nConditions in Venezuela have degenerated. Much of the country, including Caracas, has been without power for five days. Even before the blackouts, the country was struggling with violence, food shortages and the collapse of its public health system. The blackouts worsened the situation at barely functioning hospitals, where patients begged for care.\nBrett Bruen, a former American diplomat who has worked in Venezuela, said Mr. Pompeo\u2019s announcement of the embassy withdrawal appeared hasty and lacked the details needed to clarify United States policy and action.\n\u201cWhat is our message to Guaid\u00f3\u2019s supporters?\u201d Mr. Bruen said. \u201cWhat should American citizens in the country do? How should other countries respond?\u201d\nHe added that the Trump administration appeared to be invoking the potential use of military force much too frequently \u2014 including in Mr. Pompeo\u2019s announcement \u2014 saying it played into Mr. Maduro\u2019s warnings that the United States was the muscle behind the attempted coup.\n\u201cThis continues to be my main area of concern,\u201d Mr. Bruen said. \u201cThey are using this bellicose rhetoric pretty cavalierly. It strengthens Maduro\u2019s position without seeming to be part of an escalation strategy.\u201d\nElliott Abrams, the special representative on Venezuela, maintained on Tuesday that the United States was continuing to look at all options, including military intervention, but said additional economic sanctions on financial institutions would be announced first.\nHe also said the United States was continuing to talk to China about complying with the American-led isolation of Venezuela, and expressed concerns about Turkey\u2019s refusal so far to recognize Mr. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s leadership.\nMr. Abrams, who was named the special representative in late January, has a contentious history in promoting forceful and violent United States intervention in Latin America. His new role has fueled suspicions among some liberal members of Congress and analysts about the direction of Trump administration actions on Venezuela.\nIn January, after what opposition leaders and American officials called a sham election, Mr. Maduro was sworn in for a second presidential term. In his first term, he had overseen a government widely believed to be corrupt and the country\u2019s economic collapse.\nOn Jan. 23, Mr. Guaid\u00f3, the head of the National Assembly, invoked the country\u2019s Constitution to declare himself the interim president. His presidency was recognized by the Trump administration, Canada and many Latin American nations.\nMr. Maduro accused the United States of plotting to overthrow him and cut diplomatic ties. The Pentagon put 50 Marines on alert in case the United States needed to deploy a military force to the embassy in Caracas. At the time, Mr. Pompeo also decided to withdraw most personnel from the embassy but asked a handful to stay and maintain ties with the Guaid\u00f3 government.\n\u201cEither you stand with the forces of freedom or you\u2019re in league with Maduro and his mayhem,\u201d he said at a United Nations Security Council meeting in January. Soon afterward, some European nations announced they were recognizing Mr. Guaid\u00f3. As of this week, more than 50 governments have recognized him.\nMr. Trump has tried to push Mr. Maduro out by pressuring his government through sanctions. Most notably, the Treasury Department announced in late January what is effectively an oil embargo. That served as the peak of the Trump administration\u2019s use of its major diplomatic and economic tools, said Mr. Cutz, the former senior White House adviser.\n\u201cThe question is: Will it be enough to end the loyalty that exists between senior officials and Maduro?\u201d Mr. Cutz said at the time. \u201cIf they don\u2019t abandon him, things get tricky.\u201d\nAfter Mr. Pompeo\u2019s order for all American diplomats to leave Caracas, it was unclear what would happen to the United States Embassy. A \u201cprotecting power\u201d would watch over it, Mr. Abrams said on Tuesday, but exactly who has that authority is uncertain.\nHe said the diplomats\u2019 departure would result in some difficulties, including being able to remain in touch with Venezuelan officials and citizens.", "date": "March 12, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/world/americas/venezuela-embassy-usa.html", "tags": "options venezuelan \u201c maduro venezuela oust u.s. united states pompeo low ruler runs"}
