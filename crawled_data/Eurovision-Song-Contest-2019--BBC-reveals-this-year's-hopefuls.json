{"title": "Eurovision Song Contest 2019: BBC reveals this year's hopefuls", "content": "Six contestants will battle it out to represent the UK at the Eurovision Song Contest in Israel this May.\nThe hopefuls, mostly drawn from the ranks of TV reality shows, were unveiled on BBC Radio 2 on Wednesday.\nThey include Michael Rice, who won BBC singing competition All Together Now last year, and 2017 X Factor competitor Holly Tandy.\nUnusually, the six contestants share three songs - each putting their own spin on one of the potential entries.\nThe public will choose who goes through to the final in a live TV show, Eurovision: You Decide, on Friday, 8 February.\nLast year, the UK fared particularly badly - with singer SuRie finishing 24th out of 26. \nHer performance was interrupted by a stage invader, who grabbed her microphone and shouted slogans about the media.\nThe contest was eventually won by Israeli singer Netta with her quirky song Toy, which encouraged people to celebrate their differences.\nHere's a guide to the UK's hopefuls for Tel Aviv in 2019.\nWho are they? Holly Tandy, from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, took part in The X Factor in 2017 when she was just 16. Nicole Scherzinger praised her \"big voice\", but she struggled in the live shows, eventually finishing seventh. She has a nice hat.\nHartlepool busker Michael Rice won All Together Now - that's the singing contest with 100 judges (and Geri Halliwell) - in 2018. He was working on his debut single when the opportunity to enter Eurovision came along.\nIs the song any good? Kind of. It's a cliche-ridden love ballad whose verses owe a sizeable melodic debt to Bonnie Raitt's infinitely superior I Can't Make You Love Me. \nHow do the two versions differ? Michael has made it into a piano ballad that showcases his soulful vocals. It goes a bit haywire at the end with an OTT gospel choir and an unnecessary key change. \nHolly's version is more up-tempo with a pleasant acoustic guitar and that weird \"ghost cat\" noise that's been on every pop single since Justin Bieber's What Do You Mean. For good measure, she's thrown in a handclap-assisted breakdown for the final chorus, which could play well in front of an audience.\nWho wrote it? The four writers include Eurovision veterans Laurell Barker and Jonas Thander - who also played saxophone on Taylor Swift's Shake It Off.\nKey lyric: \"I can feel the Universe when I'm feeling you breathe.\"\nThe verdict: Cinq points.\nWho are they? Jordan Clarke competed in series seven of Britain's Got Talent as part of the band Luminites, reaching the semi-final; and later played with short-lived pop band Chasing Midnight. He's been making music solo since they split.\nMaid are a newly-formed girl group consisting of the ornately-named Miracle Chance, Kat Kleve and Blythe Jandoo. They met at drama school and have stage credits including Starlight Express, The Wizard of Oz and The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Blythe will also appear in Guy Ritchie's live-action remake of Aladdin later this year.\nWhat about the song? Freaks picks up on the pop trend of celebrating people's differences - with the twist that the lyrics are totally bananas. \"I don't see the difference between me, you, your, tu or moi, vous,\" it observes, obliterating all the grammar lessons we were taught in French class. \nHow do the two versions differ? Jordan gives Freaks a pop twist with sprightly piano chords and a chugging beat that recalls Take That's Shine. Your mum will like it.\nMaid describe their version as \"ethereal and dark\" - and they deliver some impressive harmonies. But the arrangement is too intricate for a Eurovision audience who prefer their songs to come with clucking chickens.\nWho wrote it? This one has a good pedigree: Rick Parkhouse and George Tizzard have written and produced songs for Take That, Cheryl, James Arthur, 5 Seconds of Summer and (this is not a joke) Green Day.\nKey lyric: It's a toss-up between \"I've been locked in a locker, I was picked last at soccer\" and \"We could all be disciples, and we'll write our own bibles\".\nThe verdict: Deux points\nWho are they? Former teacher Kerrie-Anne Phillips took part in The X Factor in 2015. She was mentored by Simon Cowell, but was eliminated at the judges' houses stage. \nAnisa Moghaddam was named by the BBC Asian Network as one of its Future Sounds in 2016. She's since supported Ne-Yo, Brandy and James Arthur in concert and recorded a track, Music, with Wretch 32.\nWhat about the song? Sweet Lies finds Anisa and Kerrie-Anne papering over the cracks of a crumbling relationship.\nHow have they interpreted it? Kerrie-Anne takes the heartbreak and turns it into a Gloria Gaynor-style dance anthem full of house piano and bass drops.\nAnisa goes in the opposite direction, delivering a stripped-back ballad that clearly draws inspiration from Alicia Keys and Lauryn Hill.\nWho wrote it? Among the song's three writers is Lise Cabble, whose song Only Teardrops helped Denmark's Emmelie de Forest win Eurovision 2013.\nKey lyric: \"Our love is paper thin/I need you skin to skin.\"\nThe verdict: Dix points.\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.
