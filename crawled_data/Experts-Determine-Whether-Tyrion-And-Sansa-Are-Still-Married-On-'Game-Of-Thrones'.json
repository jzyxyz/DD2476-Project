{"title": "Experts Determine Whether Tyrion And Sansa Are Still Married On 'Game Of Thrones'", "content": "Love and marriage are rocky subjects in the world of Westeros. Siblings get busy in towers, aunts and nephews rendezvous on the Narrow Sea and sworn virgins run off with wildling women.\nBut there is one marital mystery that still stumps \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d fans, and it involves lawfully wedded couple Tyrion Lannister (Peter Dinklage) and Sansa Stark (Sophie Turner), who will surely see each other again when Tyrion arrives in Winterfell with Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) and Jon Snow (Kit Harington) in Season 8.\nThe question remains: Are Tyrion and Sansa technically still married? And, if so, what does it mean for the final outcome in the quest for the Iron Throne?\u00a0\nFirst, a quick recap. Tyrion and Sansa officially said \u201cI do\u201d in Season 3 at the demand of Tywin Lannister (Charles Dance), and it becomes a humiliating affair for both bride and groom. Despite being forced to marry the imp of House Lannister, however, Sansa \u2015 the \u201ctraitor\u201d Ned Stark\u2019s daughter \u2015 begins to bond with him over their shared status in King\u2019s Landing.\u00a0\n\u201cThe disgraced daughter and the demon monkey,\u201d Tyrion, who\u2019s in a committed relationship with Shae (Sibel Kekilli) at this point, tells Sansa. \u201cWe\u2019re perfect for each other.\u201d\nBut just when they have all the makings to become a power couple in Westeros, Tyrion is informed that his family conspired with the Freys and Boltons to savagely murder Sansa\u2019s brother Robb (Richard Madden) and mother Catelyn (Michelle Fairley) at what\u2019s known as the Red Wedding. Once she learns what happened, Sansa no longer trusts anyone in the capital, let alone her Lannister husband who \u201cswore to protect her.\u201d\nWhen chaos erupts following the poisonous death of King Joffrey (Jack Gleeson) at the start of Season 4, Tyrion and Sansa are separated. Sansa\u00a0quickly escapes King\u2019s Landing with the help of Littlefinger, and Tyrion eventually makes his way to Meereen to sync up with Dany following his victorious escape from prison.\nLittlefinger then stupidly\u00a0arranges a marriage between Sansa and the cold-hearted bastard son of Roose Bolton, Ramsay (Iwan Rheon), who is currently ruling Winterfell. She is raped on her wedding night, beaten and tormented \u2014\u00a0a storyline many disapprove of\u00a0\u2014 before she is able to break free of Ramsay\u2019s clutches and find her way back to Jon. She, with help from the Knights of the Vale, wins back control of the North in the Battle of the Bastards and gloriously feeds Ramsay to his own, very hungry, dogs. Sansa is now Lady of Winterfell, set to protect her people from the army of the dead alongside her Stark siblings.\u00a0\nWhich brings us back to our question about the status of Tyrion and Sansa\u2019s marriage.\nIn Westeros, most marriages begin with a religious ceremony involving the exchange of vows in the presence of a sacred witness, depending on the couple\u2019s faith.\u00a0A septon unites those who follow the Faith of the Seven, a priest or priestess does the same for believers in the Drowned God or R\u2019hllor, and a Godswood heart tree is used by followers of the Old Gods. The ceremony is followed by a feast with the bride and groom before the bedding takes place, where the marriage is consummated.\nThe thing is, Tyrion and Sansa never consummated their marriage, as he didn\u2019t feel it appropriate to lie with a woman who was not ready to be with him.\nNow, Westeros is clearly a fantasy world created by A Song of Ice and Fire author George R.R. Martin, but it does resemble medieval Europe. Martin has also said that the Faith of the Seven is inspired by the Catholic Church, so it wouldn\u2019t be a stretch to assume the laws of medieval marriage somewhat apply to Westeros.\nThat\u2019s why we reached out to some history experts to get their takes on Tyrion and Sansa\u2019s relationship status.\nNancy F. Cott, Jonathan Trumbull Research Professor of American History at Harvard University, who\u2019s an expert in marriage history, believes it\u2019s all quite simple.\n\u201cIn ecclesiastical law, the Church would say they are married to each other forever so long as they had pledged themselves and consummated the marriage with sex,\u201d Cott told HuffPost.\u00a0\nOne medieval history expert, however, gives a vastly different answer.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cConsummation was not necessary for a marriage,\u201d Ruth Mazo Karras, Lecky Professor of History at Trinity College Dublin, told HuffPost. \u201cAs long as both parties are of age, not too closely related to each other and all other things that would make it a valid marriage, once they have said their vows, they are married and they stay married. Even if they separated, they wouldn\u2019t be able to marry anybody else.\u201d\u00a0\nKarras believes that, according to this late 12th-century law, Sansa and Ramsay\u2019s marriage was an adulterous one. They were never fully married, even though Littlefinger told Roose Bolton\u00a0that Sansa and Tyrion\u2019s union was invalid because it was never consummated.\n\u201cWesteros might have different laws, but to get a marriage annulled, you have to show that it\u2019s not valid in the first place. Saying they never consummated it was not sufficient to get it annulled,\u201d Karras said. \u201cIn practical terms, the pope \u2015 and again, this is in medieval Europe \u2015 might have been more willing to annul a marriage that hadn\u2019t been consummated on other grounds, but the fact that it was not consummated was not grounds for annulment.\u201d\nOne other Westerosi marriage was successfully annulled on the show to make\u00a0Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark\u2019s marriage valid. We find out that, before their wedding ceremony, the groom first secured permission from the High Septon to annul his marriage to Elia Martell. Per medieval law, the fact that Sansa\u2019s first marriage had not been approved for annulment prior to her marriage to Ramsay would make the latter marriage invalid.\nThere\u2019s a hitch, though. Sansa married Tyrion before the Seven Gods and Ramsay before the Old Gods \u2014 so the latter could be valid under the other religion. It truly comes down to what makes or who approves a legitimate annulment.\nIn Lysa Arryn\u2019s opinion, for example, death frees a spouse to marry another, as she tells her niece Sansa in Season 4: \u201cYou\u2019ll be a widow soon. They\u2019ll execute that dwarf for murdering the king and you\u2019ll be free to marry Robin [her cousin].\u201d\nStephanie Coontz, a history and family studies professor at The Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington, told HuffPost that the Church controlled access to marriage, divorce and remarriage in the former Roman Empire, especially after the eighth century. But there were instances in which the papacy was not the decision-maker.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cWhere the Church was not powerful or present, marriage was controlled by private families, who made up their own rules more or less,\u201d Coontz said. \u201cIt was not uncommon for a man to take a second wife or a concubine if his first didn\u2019t produce an heir, or to repudiate one wife for a more fertile or better-connected one. Parents or other kinfolk arranged the marriages of aristocrats, and often of commoners as well. Or powerful individuals arranged their own, sometimes by murdering a rival and marrying his widow to take over his land or kingdom.\u201d\nSo, by Coontz\u2019s logic, Sansa and Tyrion could still be married if those who witnessed the initial union are still committed to it. A second ceremony could even be held to validate it.\u00a0\n\u201cThey would probably have invented an occasion for another very public ceremony, with exchanges of gifts between the families, invitations of other nobles, feasting, etc,\u201d Coontz said.\u00a0\nKarras disagreed. \u201cUnder medieval canon law, they would still be married and wouldn\u2019t need any kind of ceremony,\u201d she said.\n\u201cNow, if you looked earlier in the 12th century, there\u2019s considerable disagreement among canon lawyers about whether consummation is necessary for a completed marriage,\u201d Karras said. \u201cThere is an opinion that if you have one marriage that\u2019s not consummated and then you have a subsequent marriage that is consummated, the one that is consummated takes precedence. So it totally depends on which set of laws you apply.\u201d\u00a0\nMedieval standards aside, it all comes down to what \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d showrunners Dan Weiss and David Benioff decide are the laws of the Seven Kingdoms. \u201cThis is not historical drama, so they could take whatever liberties with medieval canon law that they like,\u201d Karras said.\nThe writers could easily reveal that Tyrion and Sansa\u2019s marriage is still valid, or they could land on the fact that Sansa is a single woman after Ramsay\u2019s death.\u00a0\nAs Cott pointedly said, \u201cIt\u2019s fantasy anyway, why aim for \u2018real\u2019 detail?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0", "date": "\n04/06/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/tyrion-sansa-game-of-thrones_n_5ca4b145e4b0798240254e2b", "tags": "determine medieval \u201d experts whether sansa marriage one consummated married thrones tyrion still"}
