{"title": "'Game Of Thrones' Actor Joe Dempsie Finally Reveals What Happened To Gendry", "content": "And now, his rowing is ended.\nAfter he climbed into a boat and rowed out of our lives in Season 3 of \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d the most memed-about mystery on the show became \u201cwhat happened to Gendry?\u201d\nFinally, on Season 7 , Episode 5, \u201cEastwatch,\u201d actor Joe Dempsie brought his character, the bastard son of Robert Baratheon, back to \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d when Davos discovered him blacksmithing for the Lannisters at King\u2019s Landing.\nAnd Dempsie couldn\u2019t be more relieved.\n\u201cThank God,\u201d the actor told HuffPost of Gendry\u2019s return. \u201cIt\u2019s a relief, mate. I think the question of, \u2018Where is Gendry?\u2019 \u2018What are you up to, dude?\u2019 \u2018You still rowing, man?\u2019 has become part of my daily existence for the last three years.\u201d\nThough, Dempsie is thankful for all those questions and all your memes, saying they probably helped him stay employed.\n\u201cIt was always the plan to bring Gendry back at some point and tie up that loose end and answer those questions, but you\u2019re also aware that the show is huge, and the show is bigger than any one character or an actor. It is the sum of its parts,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re never sure whether they [the showrunners] are going to have time. They might decide a couple of years down the line that there are other storylines they need to concentrate on as it reaches its climax, and I guess if no one really seems to notice that you\u2019ve gone, you\u2019re an easy character to lose.\u201d\n\u201cThey probably kept me in a job,\u201d Dempsie added. The actor officially learned he would be returning about 18 months ago, and had to keep the news a secret ever since. \u201cThis feels like a real exhale. It\u2019s gonna be out there, and it\u2019s great to be back involved,\u201d he said.\nBut, let\u2019s get down to the real question: What happened to Gendry?\n\u201cI think that hiding-in-plain-sight thing is what Gendry decided is the best way to go about it. King\u2019s Landing, and particularly Flea Bottom,\u00a0it\u2019s an environment he\u2019s familiar with and often that\u2019s easiest to survive in those types of places. The landscape you know, the people you know, all the tricks of the trade and sort of how you can go unnoticed,\u201d Dempsie said.\nThe actor also talked about how Gendry\u2019s experiences have shaped him into the character he\u2019s become.\u00a0\u201cHe almost misses the danger he was in before, and added to that he\u2019s making weapons for Lannisters, the family he now knows killed his father, the family that he knows tried to have him killed, and there\u2019s a great deal of resentment that\u2019s been allowed to fester as a result of that,\u201d he said.\nDempsie continued to open up about what we can expect from Gendry and what he really thought of all those memes. And, most importantly, he revealed whether all that rowing made him super ripped \u2015 or not.\nWhat\u2019s it been like seeing all the memes over the years?\nI have to sort of take a portion of responsibility. I fueled the fire.\nOh, I know. I\u2019ve seen your tweets.\nYeah,\u00a0dude, and it\u2019s lovely. It\u2019s quite rare as an actor you get a chance to be involved in something that has such a huge committed fan base that\u2019s all over the world, that are also really funny and clever and so obsessed about it and have the time to make these memes. I\u2019ve just enjoyed it. Every year there\u2019s a fresh batch. Whether it be \u201cThe Life of Gendry,\u201d like the \u201cLife of Pi\u201d\u00a0in the boat with the tiger. It never ceases to amaze me how inventive people could be, and I\u2019ve enjoyed it in a way. It\u2019s going to be sad to see that element go, but yeah, it\u2019s been a riot.\nSo are your arms completely jacked now?\nAw,\u00a0mate, I mean, this is the thing. I see that. I see that on the internet,\u00a0and then I have to look at my own arms and go, \u201cAh, there are going to be some disappointed people out there.\u201d The thing is this time around, like in the first three seasons when I was first offered the part, I was astounded because as an actor when you\u2019re sent a script or some scenes to read for an audition, they usually give a little breakdown of the character \u2015 just\u00a0a few lines to give a sense of who this person is and maybe a physical description \u2015 and the physical description was \u201ctall, muscular, with thick black hair.\u201d And I was literally none of those three. So I thought, \u201cAll right. This isn\u2019t going to go my way.\u201d Then they offered me the part, but they did say, \u201cWe\u2019re going to dye your hair black, and it\u2019d be great if you hit the gym and put on a bit of bulk before you get here.\u201d\nI still try and go to the gym in between jobs, but when you have that goal, when you have a thing where you go, \u201cAll right. I have to start filming on this date and they\u2019ve told me I need to be jacked,\u201d you get that motivation to keep going. Then it becomes a habit or borders on an obsession sometimes, so I kept myself in shape the first three seasons, and then I had a scene I think in Season 2 where I\u2019m fairly inexplicably forging a sword with no top on. I mean, it\u2019s raining. I can\u2019t say that it\u2019s warm. He\u2019s just got his bod out, and David [Benioff] and Dan [Weiss] knew that I had been hitting the gym in order to get in shape for that. So this time around when I was coming back, they said, \u201cAll right, so yeah, you\u2019re coming back and you better hit the gym, dude, and get back in shape.\u201d\nAnd then I was like, \u201cAll right,\u00a0OK.\u201d Really, really went for it. And then there was no scene whatsoever. No gratuitous shirtless scene. Usually,\u00a0I\u2019m like, \u201cIf I\u2019m going to do anything like that, that needs to make sense for the story for the narrative.\u201d It needs to have some integrity to it. I\u2019m not just going to get my top off for no reason. Then, this time around, I was like, \u201cYou better put a gratuitous topless scene. I\u2019ve spent hours in that fucking gym!\u201d [Laughs] And there was nothing. Viewers aren\u2019t going to be able to see under my shirt, so I\u2019m just going to pretend that, yeah, he\u2019s huge.\nHah. Yeah, Davos even makes a rowing joke when you come back.\nYeah, yeah,\u00a0he does. And I think that\u2019s the thing I sort of noticed reading the scripts for Season 7. That it\u2019s an indication of what a phenomenon this show is. It\u2019s become such a cultural reference point, \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d\u00a0and there\u2019s so much talk about it. The fans are so keen. I think David and Dan are allowing themselves a couple of real crowd-pleasing moments in a way that maybe they didn\u2019t do in the first few seasons, a couple of little nods to fan theories or things that people seem to want to happen. They\u2019re able to be a little more self-referential now. They\u2019re just in their groove, those guys, and I think it takes a real confidence in your work to know you can do that and get away with it. For it not to veer into the cheesy or the cliches, like, \u201cDavos says that and then\u00a0looks down the\u00a0lens and winks.\u201d\nIt\u2019s just put in there, and people are going to love it. I think they\u2019ve not been afraid to do that. The story is still absolutely traveling in the direction they\u2019ve decided, and that they \u2015 along with George R.R. Martin \u2015 have wanted it to go. There\u2019s no sense of pandering to anybody else, but they\u2019re confident enough to give those little nods here and there, and I think people are going to really dig it.\nWhat theory about Gendry did you find wackiest?\nI love the theory that he might be the one rowing past and pick up Theon in terms of just really going, \u201cYeah, he has been rowing the whole time.\u201d If they were bold enough, had the balls to do that, I\u2019d be astounded.\u00a0\nWhat was it like finally being back on set?\nIt certainly takes a few days of filming to feel comfortable again and at ease, and at home on such a huge production. But it\u2019s been great. It\u2019s been so nice. When you do get that comfort back, it\u2019s almost like you never really left. There are these tiny little things that are a bit different, a few things slightly different now because the interest in the show has grown and grown and grown. There\u2019s a lot more security around scripts and call sheets, and your character name. You have a code name on a call sheet. Unless you knew everybody\u2019s code name, you wouldn\u2019t be able to account which characters are in the scene, and that was just totally alien to me.\nAre you all keeping the same code names, or could you reveal it?\nOf course not! I mean, I just got my job back. [Laughs] I don\u2019t want to get sacked again. But,\u00a0yeah, they\u2019re interesting. They\u2019re inventive.\nHopefully we can hear those one day.\nOh,\u00a0dude, the second Season 8 is over, I\u2019m selling the lot.\nNow that Gendry\u2019s back, what do you think an Arya and Gendry reunion might be like?\nThat\u2019s been the amazing thing to watch about this season so far. It\u2019s very deliberate, seeing the Stark children and the shit they\u2019ve been through and how that has affected them all.\nSansa seems to be the rational one whose eyes we\u2019re seeing all this through. The joy you\u2019re seeing and then the slow realization that, \u201cOh, my god. That\u2019s really not the brother that I knew, and that\u2019s not the sister that I remember.\u201d They\u2019ve seen terrible things, and they\u2019ve had experiences that have changed them forever, and there\u2019s bound to be some of that with Gendry seeing Arya again \u2015 if it was to happen.\nAs well, we don\u2019t know what might have happened to Gendry in intervening periods. His experience with Melisandre,\u00a0as you\u2019ll see later in this season, is still something that rankles with him, something that he\u2019s maybe not quite able to get over in his mind. These things are all happening at quite formative ages, so I think it\u2019d be great to see them cross paths again. I have no idea what it would be like, but I think they must carry some torch for each other. I think they crossed paths at that time where they were both searching for something, and they kind of found it in each other a little bit. I think Gendry really reminded Arya of her brothers back up in Winterfell,\u00a0who she was missing greatly. Then Arya trusting Gendry with the information that she was who she was. I\u2019m filling in my own blanks here, but I don\u2019t imagine that Gendry ever felt that he\u2019d been trusted like that before by anybody, and maybe the first time in his life that he was given real purpose \u2015 the purpose being to keep a secret \u2015 but he\u2019s like, \u201cOh, someone actually trusted me with a task that\u2019s really fucking important,\u201d and the fact that interacting with highborns is something Gendry\u2019s never done before, so it was almost the beginning of opening his eyes, and being conscious that there is much more out there than what he has known his entire life. There is a bond there, and I hope they get to cross paths again at some point.\nYeah, plus she was around for your shirtless scene, so at least the gym was working for you there.\n[Laughs] I was disingenuous before when I said it was pointless to have my top off. The idea of that scene, yeah, I mean David and Dan were like, \u201cLook, it\u2019s more about Arya than it is about Gendry. She\u2019s becoming a young woman and is noticing things and feeling things like she hasn\u2019t felt before.\u201d Whether the romantic storyline is one they chose to pursue or not, I have no idea.\nI used to get asked about that quite a lot when we were doing Seasons 1 through 3, and it was never something that I ever felt massively comfortable talking about because at the time I was a 25-year-old actor talking about a 14-year-old girl, and I sort of felt like, \u201cLook, I know what you\u2019re saying. I know what you\u2019re getting at, but what do you want me to say about that? \u2018Oh, yeah, no, I really hope we hook up?\u2019\u201d So that\u2019s something I\u2019ve given a great amount of thought to, really,\u00a0and it\u2019s been years. I\u2019ll be interested to\u00a0see what David and Dan have in store.\nThere\u2019s a scene in Season 7 where Arya doesn\u2019t like Ned Stark\u2019s statue in the Winterfell crypts and says it should\u2019ve been done by someone who knows his face. Gendry knows Ned Stark\u2019s face and is a craftsman. What do you think about him making Arya a Ned Stark statue one day?\nI think that\u2019d be great. Hopefully he\u2019d make it out to Winterfell and not have sort of a Lionel Richie\u00a0\u201cHello\u201d type of thing, he drags it up as a present for Arya.\u00a0But, yeah, I mean, that\u2019s an interesting theory. I think you might be on to something there. I personally would like to hope that Gendry has a bigger role to play in the end game than carving a statue of Ned Stark, but I think it\u2019s plausible, dude.\nHaha, for sure.\nI think it\u2019s plausible, but that\u2019s the thing. That\u2019s the beauty of \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d\u00a0There are those lines that seem very throw away, but there will be someone out there that\u2019s heard it and goes, \u201cWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What does that mean?\u201d And it\u2019s just brilliant. There\u2019s an endless amount of pawing over the scripts you can do. Theories you can come up with from the most, it would seem, really innocuous of lines. But David and Dan, they\u2019re not really in the habit of writing lines for no reason,\u00a0so you might well be right.\nYou\u2019re the bastard of Robert Baratheon. Jon Snow is thought of as the bastard of his best friend, Ned Stark. What was the significance of those two meeting?\nIt\u2019s interesting because there are so many quite complex dynamics going on there ... essentially on the way to go meet with Jon Snow, King in the North,\u00a0Davos does tell Gendry,\u00a0almost the last thing he says is, \u201cBy the way, don\u2019t mention who you are. It\u2019s best to just keep that a secret for now.\u201d And Gendry says, \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d It\u2019s the first thing Gendry says when he gets in is he\u2019s the bastard son of Robert Baratheon!\u00a0\nAs I\u2019ve said before, Gendry\u2019s world was so small. He was told by Melisandre that he\u2019s the son of Robert Baratheon, legitimate or not, and I think that actually in the intervening years he\u2019s always been someone that\u2019s never been quite sure who he was \u2015 didn\u2019t know who either of his parents were. I think there are\u00a0a lot of identity issues that come with that. To spend your life adrift in that sense, it must be kind of difficult, and to finally learn something that places you in the world. In his time away, he\u2019s become quite proud of it, actually ... he\u2019s forged himself a war hammer, which is famously the weapon King Robert used in battle, used formidably in battle. I think you can just tell Gendry is kind of pleased. He\u2019s sort of feeling himself a little bit now that he\u2019s a Baratheon or he\u2019s got Baratheon blood in him.\nHe\u2019s obviously heard about Jon Snow,\u00a0King in the North. People talk. Gendry probably feels that he might after many, many years, finally meet someone he has common ground with, both being bastards and the confused identity that goes with that. I think also there\u2019s something about seeing what Jon Snow has managed to do, and the respect that he has, and how he\u2019s been able to transcend the label of bastard, him being King in the North,\u00a0I think Gendry really looks up to, and he\u2019s also got to bear in mind that he\u2019s a king and there\u2019s certain etiquette that you have to respect, which I don\u2019t think Gendry is that familiar with. He\u2019s spent the majority of his life in Flea Bottom\u00a0with the peasants,\u00a0right? What manners? So this is all kind of new for him, but there\u2019s an element certainly from Gendry\u2019s point of view he senses a bit of a kindred spirit, and I think it\u2019d be really interesting to see what Jon and Gendry could do as a team. It certainly wouldn\u2019t be one to be messed with. Gendry says to Davos he\u2019s been training himself, so I think they\u2019re both pretty handy when it comes to battle.\nWhere do you think Gendry goes from here?\nHe has numerous potential purposes, whether that\u2019s forging dragonglass for the impending war or political ambitions. I don\u2019t know, but we\u2019ll have to just wait and see.\nGendry \u2015 in my heart of hearts \u2015 I don\u2019t see him as a person that would make an active play for power unless he would be manipulated by someone a bit further down the line, but then again there\u2019s that old idea that anyone who wants power probably shouldn\u2019t be allowed to have it on that basis. Jon Snow is someone for who power was hoisted upon him. He didn\u2019t want to lead.\u00a0\nWhat can we expect the rest of the way?\u00a0\nThere\u2019s a sense that the story is really moving at pace now. There\u2019s less time for character development and exploration and it\u2019s more \u201cAvengers Assemble\u201d\u2013type of thing now, with everyone converging on this one place, and shit is about to go down. There\u2019s a sense among the cast now we\u2019re really getting to the end of this,\u00a0and that\u2019ll be bittersweet.\nI was talking to one of the writers, Bryan Cogman actually, and he was saying David and Dan emailed him the script for Season 8, Episode 6, and he said he sort of didn\u2019t want to open it. He didn\u2019t want to open the file because he knew that once he opened it and started reading, once he got to that last page, that was it, must be a real mix of emotions when that happens. It\u2019s been an incredibly enjoyable and manic and long journey for a lot of people involved. And I don\u2019t envy David and Dan the task of bringing it to an implicit and satisfying, but somewhat surprising, conclusion.\nThis interview has been edited and condensed.", "date": "\n08/13/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/game-of-thrones-actor-joe-dempsie-finally-reveals-what-happened-to-gendry_n_59905bc3e4b08a2472750692", "tags": "think going joe really actor yeah back finally dempsie gendry \u201d reveals thrones get like happened"}
