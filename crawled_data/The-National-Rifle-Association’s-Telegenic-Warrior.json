{"title": "The National Rifle Association\u2019s Telegenic Warrior", "content": "DALLAS \u2014 Dana Loesch has a biblical inscription tattooed on her forearm, a reference to a passage in the Book of Ephesians that calls for Christians to wear holy armor to protect themselves from a dark world. It is an apt precept for Ms. Loesch, a 39-year-old conservative radio talk-show host and political commentator who views the world through a lens of fear and violence.\nIt is why she has an arsenal of firearms strategically placed in safes throughout her home. She keeps a handgun near her bed in the event of an intruder, she said, which she can use until she finds a more powerful shotgun or rifle nearby. She sometimes tucks a gun in the small of her back. Other times, she keeps a knife in her purse.\n\u201cEvil is real,\u201d she said over a plate of barbecued sausage last month in a suburban restaurant.\nAnd if there is a question about what God has to do with any of this, she keeps a sign in the window of the house that she and her family recently vacated. \u201cThis home protected by the good lord and a gun,\u201d it read. \u201cIf you came here to steal or do harm you might meet them both.\u201d\nMs. Loesch has been a voice of the conservative movement for nearly a decade, first at Breitbart News Network, where she analyzed politics and the media, and later for a television show on The Blaze media network. She has written two books, \u201cHands Off My Gun: Defeating the Plot to Disarm America\u201d (2014) and \u201cFlyover Nation: You Can\u2019t Run a Country You\u2019ve Never Been To\u201d (2016). And she has had her own national radio show since 2008. But it wasn\u2019t until last year that people farther afield took notice, when she was featured in a recruiting ad for the National Rifle Association.\nPundits from the left and right said it stoked violence and civic unrest; the neoconservative Bill Kristol called the video \u201cludicrous.\u201d But Ms. Loesch, who was named the spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association in 2017, delights in a brawl, particularly if it\u2019s public.\n\u201cWhen she knows she has just upset someone, she will laugh,\u201d said Ben Howe, a close friend and senior contributing editor at RedState.com who worked with her at The Blaze. He added, \u201cShe\u2019ll be ready to jump into the fray, swinging her sword, and see who gets killed later.\u201d\nAnn Coulter found her voice as a Cassandra for the right in the early 2000s. In the Trump era, Ms. Loesch has found hers as a telegenic warrior for the N.R.A. She shares some characteristics with President Trump, said Megyn Kelly, the NBC talk show host who used to have her on as a guest on Fox News when Ms. Kelly had a show there. \u201cShe is compelling television,\u201d she said.\nEven Ms. Kelly, a friend, has noticed that Ms. Loesch has embraced a more barbed tone the past year. \u201cOn my show, she was never a bomb thrower,\u201d Ms. Kelly said. \u201cWe tried to veer away from that.\u201d But public conversation has grown more cacophonous since Mr. Trump\u2019s election. And unlike Ms. Coulter in her heyday, Ms. Loesch faces an ever-expanding field of conservative pundits willing to do anything to entertain followers on Twitter, in their jostle for the seats at Fox\u2019s table.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been told I\u2019m a whore for the N.R.A.,\u201d Ms. Loesch said. \u201cI\u2019m a prostitute for the N.R.A. But I believe so strongly in the natural right to bear arms. I feel so passionately about that.\u201d\nDismissal only firms her resolve. \u201cI\u2019m feeling like I am doing what I want to do,\u201d she said, \u201cand what I feel fulfilled in doing.\u201d\nFor as long as Ms. Loesch can remember, the world has been a scary place. She was born Dana Eaton in 1978 in Hematite, Mo., a small community about 40 miles south of St. Louis. Her parents divorced when she was in kindergarten and she has not spoken to her father in more than a decade. Her mother worked three jobs after they moved to nearby Festus, Mo., bringing home bags of granola bars after her shift at a local granola factory. Ms. Loesch said she spent school-day afternoons at home alone or with an aunt.\n\u201cNow, you could say it was like a meth \u2019hood,\u201d Ms. Loesch said of her old neighborhood. \u201cPeople were fighting. It was kind of crazy. It wasn\u2019t the most stable of childhoods.\u201d\nMs. Loesch mostly found refuge at her grandparents\u2019 home in Annapolis, Mo., a town of about 450 people nestled in the rural Ozarks. Her family voted for Democrats. Her grandfather hunted deer and raccoon. Despite episodes of violence, Ms. Loesch idealized summers in Annapolis in \u201cFlyover Country.\u201d In the book, she recalled her grandfather standing on the porch one night with a shotgun in his hands. Ms. Loesch\u2019s aunt had just arrived; her estranged husband had threatened to kill her.\n\u201cLooking back,\u201d Ms. Loesch said, \u201cI think I always wanted to know that I was safe.\u201d\nIn the late 1990s, Ms. Loesch attended Webster University in suburban St. Louis, studying journalism, but dropped out after she got pregnant. In 2000, she married Chris Loesch, the baby\u2019s father: a musician and son of a preacher who now manages her career. They attend weekly services at the Church of Christ. And on Halloween they give a party that harks back to more pleasant childhood memories. \u201cHalloween was big with her mom,\u201d said Leigh Wambsganns, a friend. Last October Ms. Loesch said she dressed as Wonder Woman.\nAs a new parent in St. Louis, she blogged about motherhood and began her long-running radio program, \u201cThe Dana Show.\u201d She became disillusioned with Democratic politics, though, in the wake of President Clinton\u2019s affair with Monica Lewinsky. She helped found the St. Louis Tea Party, organizing protests and speaking at rallies. And, in 2010, she joined Andrew Breitbart at his website, one of several new voices railing against establishment politics and media bias.\nAfter Mr. Breitbart died in 2012, Ms. Loesch clashed with Steve Bannon, the former Trump ally who had been named executive chair of Breitbart News. She sued to get out of her contract. In 2014, she moved to Dallas to work for The Blaze.\nMs. Loesch\u2019s particular brand of attack proved unpalatable to mainstream audiences. In 2012, CNN, which had hired her as a political commentator, distanced itself from comments she made on her radio show supporting a group of Marines who urinated on dead Taliban soldiers. She claims the reporting of her comments was \u201cdisingenuous.\u201d A year later, she was banned from the now defunct \u201cPiers Morgan Live\u201d after getting into a Twitter fight with the host. \u201cI thought we made up,\u201d she said. \u201cBut then we started fighting again.\u201d\nAnd, in 2016, Ms. Loesch expressed personal ire at Kayleigh McEnany, now the spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee. Ms. McEnany had chided a friend of Ms. Loesch\u2019s for not supporting Mr. Trump, then a Republican candidate, during a CNN segment. \u201cBabycakes, this was more than just going on television and flashing your pearly whites and your flat chest, red dress, over-sprayed bleach blond hair,\u201d Ms. Loesch told radio listeners.\nThis time, it seemed, she had gone too far. Ms. McEnany was undergoing treatment for a genetic predisposition to breast cancer. Both Ms. Loesch and Ms. McEnany declined to discuss the matter.\nMs. Loesch\u2019s performance for the N.R.A. has had more polish. Last April, she was featured in a recruiting ad for the organization called \u201cViolence of Lies.\u201d Scenes of street violence and protests flashed onscreen as Ms. Loesch called for citizens to fight media bias and liberal politicians with the \u201cclenched fist of truth.\u201d (The N.R.A. also released an ad in 2017 aimed at The New York Times, claiming media bias.)\nAccording to Andrew Arulanandam, the N.R.A.\u2019s managing director of public affairs, the message was \u201cinspired\u201d by the chief executive, Wayne LaPierre Jr., whose association donated $30 million in campaign support to Mr. Trump. According to news reports, the N.R.A. may have a connection to the investigation of Russia\u2019s involvement in the election. \u201cViolence of Lies\u201d has been viewed nearly three million times on YouTube alone.\n\u201cDana comes across clearly to our members and gun owners,\u201d Mr. Arulanandam said.\nBut even some in those groups found the video unnecessarily, even dangerously, incendiary. An online petition was circulated, demanding Facebook remove it. On Twitter, DeRay Mckesson, a Black Lives Matter activist, called the video \u201can open call to violence to protect white supremacy.\u201d In response, Ms. Loesch challenged him to come on her show and \u201ctell me to my face I\u2019m a racist.\u201d He didn\u2019t, saying Ms. Loesch seeks to use opponents as a foil.\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that she was really talking to me,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cShe was using me to rile up the base.\u201d Last week Ms. Loesch said she had no interest in speaking with Mr. Mckesson.\nMs. Loesch\u2019s boss, Mr. LaPierre, has a history of inflammatory rhetoric at the N.R.A., which has five million members. In 1995, he was forced to apologize after President George H. W. Bush canceled his N.R.A. membership in protest. The N.R.A. had sent out a fund-raising letter calling law enforcement \u201cjackbooted government thugs\u201d who threatened to hurt Americans. \u201cThat is what they do,\u201d said Representative Kathleen Rice, a Democrat of New York, who has sparred with Ms. Loesch, also on Twitter. \u201cThe N.R.A says their members are under attack.\u201d\nIn October, a gunman fired a weapon on concertgoers from his Las Vegas hotel room, killing 58 people and injuring more than 500 in the deadliest mass shooting in the United States. Within days, Ms. Loesch was on \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d batting away calls for gun control, calling the massacre awful and warning viewers they live in a world where \u201cmonsters exist.\u201d\nMs. Loesch said she has received death threats for the past two years; they often follow her appearances on television. In December 2016, she said, \u201cmy son went and got the mail and we had all these Christmas cards. He opened them up. And there were pictures, with their heads blown off.\u201d Not long after, someone posted her phone number and a photograph of her house on Twitter. She starting getting calls, including a man on the line, breathing heavily.\n\u201cHe said he would drag me out and beat me in the yard,\u201d said Ms. Loesch, who moved last month to a new home in suburban Dallas. \u201cI reached out to our local police.\u201d She alerted the N.R.A. \u201cIt worried them too,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are not responsible for crazy people. They want to make sure I am safe and that I am O.K. Because I have kids.\u201d\nDid the experience remind her of her childhood?\n\u201cYeah,\u201d she said. \u201cBut this time, I\u2019m my grandpa.\u201d\nMs. Loesch was greeted like a local celebrity when she arrived at the Crossfire Defense Academy & Range, eight miles from the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, which she\u2019d agreed to visit to shed light on gun ownership, a mystery to many in blue states. Ms. Loesch was met by a clutch of beefy ex-military safety officers outfitted in red shirts and camouflage pants.\nThe range was at the back of a gun shop, soundproof rooms with stalls facing paper targets clipped to a metal bar. A cartoon of a couple brandishing pistols and dressed in black tie had been taped to the door, advertising two-for-one shooting and happy hour drinks at a local taco shop. But tonight was ladies\u2019 night, and a woman dressed in black high heels was there, holding a pistol.\nMr. Loesch laid out a number of guns the couple had brought from home, including his wife\u2019s Glock 19 (a semiautomatic pistol) and an AR-15 (a semiautomatic rifle). Ms. Loesch had taped a drawing of George Washington to the magazine of her AR-15 with the words, \u201cWe The People.\u201d The body of the gun said \u201cLet It Rain!\u201d She had invited an instructor to join her, and he took her through a number of drills using her pistol. After a few adjustments, she hit the bull\u2019s-eye.\nShe urged this reporter to try her AR-15: \u201cIsn\u2019t it easy?\u201d\nIt was. Like an arcade video game.\nMs. Loesch offered thanks for the sojourn. \u201cIt means a lot to me,\u201d she said.\nIn a car ride afterward, she wished that there was also time on this trip to visit a church together.\n\u201cWe are all sinners,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are all people who have messed up. I fall short every single day.\u201d", "date": "Jan. 20, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/20/style/dana-loesch-national-rifle-association.html", "tags": "rifle warrior home telegenic \u201d ms. n.r.a gun association loesch violence national"}
