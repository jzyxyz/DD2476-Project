{"title": "Women Break New Records In 2018 Primaries", "content": "Women made history in Tuesday\u2019s elections, breaking records in congressional and gubernatorial races as the wave of female candidates winning primaries this year continued.\nVictories Tuesday in Kansas, Michigan and Missouri boosted the number of female major party nominees running for the U.S. House this year to at least 173, according to the Center for American Women and Politics.\u00a0By early Wednesday, that number had risen to 182, with several more races still too close to call.\u00a0\nThe previous record was 167.\nIn the race for governorships, Gretchen Whitmer won a heated battle to become the Democratic nominee in Michigan, and Laura Kelly became the Democratic choice in Kansas. Their wins mean that 2018 has 11 women\u00a0running as major party gubernatorial nominees, the highest number in history. The previous record was 10, in 1994.\n\u201cThis has been an election season of records for women candidates, and tonight continues that story,\u201d said Debbie Walsh, director of CAWP.\nAnd for the first time, the Michigan Democratic Party has an all-female ticket running statewide in November. Whitmer joins Sen. Debbie Stabenow, attorney general candidate Dana Nessel and secretary of state candidate Jocelyn Benson on the ballot. \nIt\u2019s not clear whether Whitmer\u2019s running mate will be male or female, but she\u2019s expected to choose that person in the coming days. The Democratic slate of nominees in Michigan has faced some criticism because it is all white, and there\u2019s speculation that Whitmer, the first woman in state history to lead the Michigan Senate Democratic caucus, could choose a person of color to be her lieutenant governor. \nMichigan Democrats also have female nominees in three of the key swing districts for Congress: former state Rep. Gretchen Driskell in the 7th District, former CIA analyst Elissa Slotkin in the 8th and former Obama administration official Haley Stevens in the 11th. Former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton endorsed Stevens on Sunday.\n\u201cCertainly, the most common thing I hear is how frustrated people are with the lack of civility, and that hopefully more women in Congress would help with that problem,\u201d Slotkin told the Detroit News.\nWhether Michigan would have an all-female ticket was the subject of significant speculation \u2015 and some consternation \u2015 throughout the campaign. \n\u201cSome were telling me that that was a reason why maybe I shouldn\u2019t be on the ticket,\u201d Whitmer said in a July interview. \u201cI didn\u2019t buy it when they said it to me and I don\u2019t buy it when they say it about other candidates. I want to make sure that I am empowering others.\u201d\nIn November, Nessel released an online ad meant to push back against the notion that it would be a weakness in the general election, urging voters to choose more women for public office because they\u2019d be less likely to sexually harass their employees. \n\u201cIf the last few weeks have taught us anything, it\u2019s that we need more women in positions of power, not less,\u201d she said in the ad. \u201cSo when you\u2019re choosing Michigan\u2019s next attorney general, ask yourself this: Who can you trust most not to show you their penis in a professional setting? Is it the candidate who doesn\u2019t have a penis? I\u2019d say so.\u201d\nIf elected, Nessel would make history as Michigan\u2019s first openly gay statewide elected official.\n\u201cThe story of this election is not just the number of women candidates running, it\u2019s the strength of those women, their stories and the experiences they will bring into office,\u201d said Stephanie Schriock, president of the pro-abortion-rights Democratic group EMILY\u2019s List. \u201cWomen are running for office and winning their primaries at a rate unlike any we\u2019ve seen before, and EMILY\u2019s List is proud to be supporting them every step of the way. From taking over state governments to flipping the House, women will be the difference for Democrats in November.\u201d\nDemocrats also touted gains women made in state elections last year in Virginia.\nIgor Bobic contributed reporting.\nThis article has been updated to include the latest results.", "date": "\n08/07/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/women-make-history_n_5b6a5a17e4b0b15abaa838cf", "tags": "history break \u201d records primaries democratic whitmer women new state michigan running"}
