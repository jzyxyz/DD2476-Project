{"title": "A Girl\u2019s Killing Puts Germany\u2019s Migration Policy on Trial", "content": "KANDEL, Germany \u2014 It happened between neatly stacked rows of shampoo and organic baby food: A teenage boy walked up to his ex-girlfriend in the local drugstore, pulled out a kitchen knife with an eight-inch blade and stabbed her in the heart.\nThe death in Kandel, in southwestern Germany, on Dec. 27 has traumatized this sleepy town of barely 10,000 inhabitants, not just because both the suspect and the victim were only 15 years old and went to the local school, but also because the boy is an Afghan migrant and the girl was German.\nFrom the moment Germany opened its doors to more than a million migrants two years ago, prominent episodes like the Berlin Christmas market attack and the New Year\u2019s molestation and rapes in Cologne have stoked German insecurities.\nBut the case of the two teenagers, Abdul D. and Mia V., has struck a special nerve because the killing happened in such a quiet and provincial setting and the two people involved were so young. It became national news, was debated over dinner tables, on talk shows and on social media sites, and reinforced fears that Germany is becoming ever less safe.\nYet perceptions are one thing, and statistics are another. Reported crimes have edged up over the past two years, but over all, violent crimes have been trending downward for a decade in Germany, which remains one of the safest countries in Europe.\nNevertheless, each crime involving a migrant or asylum seeker has become a fresh occasion for national hand-wringing.\nSomething has shifted in Germany. Not so long ago, the logistical challenge and cost of integrating new migrants still dominated the public debate. These days, the growing unease with Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s migration policy has reached a new and febrile stage.\n\u201cI am scared,\u201d said Jana Weigel, a 24-year-old dental assistant, as she lit a candle outside the DM drugstore where the killing took place.\nCalls have multiplied for mandatory medical exams to determine the age of migrants claiming to be minors and for swifter deportations of those who \u2014 like the suspect \u2014 have been denied asylum.\nA preliminary coalition agreement between Ms. Merkel\u2019s conservatives and the more liberal Social Democrats announced on Friday includes a cap of 220,000 refugees per year and strictly limits the number of family members allowed to join a refugee in Germany.\nEven in proudly tolerant and left-voting Kandel, the mood on the street has hardened. Many here took the killing personally. Before Mia broke up with Abdul, he had been welcomed into her family, Ms. Weigel pointed out, much like the hundreds of thousands of refugees who have been welcomed to Germany.\n\u201cIt makes you think,\u201d she said, \u201chow many others will betray our hospitality.\u201d\nMs. Weigel\u2019s sense of insecurity was reinforced by a widely publicized study showing that the number of reported crimes in the state of Lower Saxony had risen by more than 10 percent over the past two years and that the increase could be attributed overwhelmingly to cases involving refugees.\nHalf of that increase is due to the fact that crimes involving migrants are twice as likely to be reported, the authors of the study said. Many of the people accused of crimes are young men under 30, a demographic that is most likely to commit crimes, even among Germans.\nLess publicized was the other major finding of the report: Over all, violent crime, including murder and rape, remains well below its 2007 peak. The number of young offenders has decreased by half since then.\n\u201cThe paradox is that Germany is still a very safe country, much safer than even a few years ago,\u201d said Christian Pfeiffer, a criminologist and a co-author of the report, which was commissioned by the government and released last week. \u201cBut the perception is the opposite: People feel less safe. And when something like this murder happens, it confirms that feeling.\u201d\nAsk the Germans paying their respects at the ad hoc memorial for the girl who was killed \u2014 a sea of candles and messages and photos of her with friends \u2014 and they will reel off a list of crimes committed by migrants: a German woman who was raped by a Sudanese migrant in the nearby town of Speyer a few days earlier, another woman who was raped and strangled by an Afghan in Freiburg just over a year ago.\nMs. Weigel, who has a 2-year-old daughter, no longer leaves the house after dark. Last month, a terrorist attack was narrowly foiled at an ice rink in Karlsruhe, a 30-minute drive away.\n\u201cIt feels like we\u2019ve lost control,\u201d Ms. Weigel said. \u201cThe state has lost control.\u201d\nKandel is an orderly town of tastefully restored medieval houses and shops that close for lunch. It is also home to 125 refugees, most of them from Syria or Afghanistan.\nUntil Mia was killed, \u201cthere was never a problem,\u201d said G\u00fcnther Tieleb\u00f6rger, Kandel\u2019s mayor. He represents the Social Democrats, long the strongest party in the town. The far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, received less than 10 percent of the vote in the last election.\nKandel has a long tradition of tolerance. Three centuries ago, it welcomed Huguenot refugees from France. Where other villages in the region built a wall inside their churches to keep Catholics and Protestants apart, Kandel ripped down its wall and shared the church. One of the best restaurants in town serving regional specialties like \u201cpig\u2019s stomach\u201d is run by a Turk.\nBut this tolerance is now being tested.\nMaja Mathias, 53, works in a local French bakery and has Turkish neighbors and a Croatian brother-in-law. \u201cI have no problem with foreigners,\u201d she said, standing behind a counter featuring freshly baked baguettes and pretzels. \u201cBut there is always the fear: What else is coming?\u201d\nBeyond fear, the killing has stirred other resentments.\n\u201cGerman retirees who have worked hard for 45 years get less than the refugees,\u201d said Knoll Pede, 64, a town maintenance worker. He is no fan of President Trump, he said, \u201cbut I wouldn\u2019t mind our politicians to do a bit of \u2018Germany First.\u2019\u201d\nSuch talk worries Mr. Tieleb\u00f6rger, the mayor. The benefits migrants receive are far less generous than Germans may believe, he said, and many of the migrants are barred from work until their asylum applications have been processed. But the optics matter.\n\u201cGermans feel neglected,\u201d Mr. Tieleb\u00f6rger said.\n\u201cWe need to wake up,\u201d he said. Otherwise, he added, the left will lose votes to the right.\nOne of Mr. Tieleb\u00f6rger\u2019s former colleagues in local government is Heiko Wildberg, a former member of the liberal pro-immigration Greens party. Mr. Wildberg is now a lawmaker for the nationalist AfD in Berlin. For him, Mia\u2019s killing was a \u201cturning point.\u201d\n\u201cThis is not Berlin or Cologne; we are in small-town Germany,\u201d he said. \u201cThis murder shows that the reality of the migrant crisis has arrived in the German province.\u201d\nThe AfD was quick off the mark, organizing a silent march through Kandel two days after the killing. The more extremist National Party of Germany followed suit.\nMeanwhile, the local benefits office in Kandel had to barricade its doors because its employees had received so many threats. \u201cAccomplices,\u201d anonymous messages called them.\nSome here accuse the authorities of not doing enough to protect Mia. Abdul had stalked her online and in person and beaten up one of her classmates in a fit of jealousy.\nOn Dec. 15, her parents had reported him to the police. Twelve days later, as she was shopping with friends, he stabbed her repeatedly with a knife he had bought in a supermarket next door. She later died of her wounds.\nAfter her father told the German tabloid Bild that her ex-boyfriend \u201cwas definitely not 15,\u201d demands for medical exams to verify the claims of refugees who say they are minors have been revived.\nThe ethics commission of the body representing Germany\u2019s doctors has said that such tests \u2014 which include X-rays of hand, collar and jaw bones as well as genital exams \u2014 violate \u201cbodily integrity\u201d and can be inaccurate by up to two years.\nThey have nonetheless become a rallying cry at the highest level of politics.\n\u201cIn all cases, where no official and real document is presented, we need to determine the age in another way, if needed through medical examinations,\u201d said the conservative interior minister, Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re.\nWhen Abdul arrived in Germany in April 2016, he said he was 14, and apparently none of the officials registering him raised serious doubts about his age. As part of the court case against him, a series of medical exams will now seek to confirm his age.\nAustria, Sweden and the German state of Saarland are among the places conducting such exams regularly.\nThere is an incentive for migrants to be listed as under 18. Government benefits, access to German lessons and job opportunities are better for minors. In Saarland, more than a third of the migrants who were tested appeared to be over 18.\nMost of the unaccompanied-minor migrants are integrating well, said Anne Spiegel, the integration minister for the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, which includes Kandel. \u201cThey are attending school, learning German and signing up for apprenticeships,\u201d she said.\nStill, officials like Mr. Tieleb\u00f6rger, the mayor, say that every transgression by a migrant gets disproportionate attention, leading to the opposite impression.\nThere was another shocking homicide in Kandel in recent weeks, he pointed out. A man killed his wife and two children. That one did not make the national news.\n\u201cIf the boy had been German,\u201d Mr. Tieleb\u00f6rger said, \u201cwe wouldn\u2019t be having this conversation.\u201d", "date": "Jan. 17, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/17/world/europe/germany-teen-murder-migrant.html", "tags": "policy migration trial germany puts german \u201d killing girl two years \u2014 migrants kandel"}
