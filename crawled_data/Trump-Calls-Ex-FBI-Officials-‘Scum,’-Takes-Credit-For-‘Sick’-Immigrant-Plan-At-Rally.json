{"title": "Trump Calls Ex-FBI Officials \u2018Scum,\u2019 Takes Credit For \u2018Sick\u2019 Immigrant Plan At Rally", "content": "President Donald Trump\u00a0disparaged former FBI and Justice Department officials, expressed unabashed support for Saudi Arabia and took credit for plans to send undocumented immigrants to sanctuary cities as he spoke in typically unrestrained fashion at a rally in Wisconsin on Saturday night.\nThe nearly 90-minute long rally coincided with much of the annual White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner in Washington, which Trump administration officials\u00a0boycotted\u00a0at the president\u2019s behest.\nTrump opened his remarks by offering condolences to victims of the deadly synagogue shooting in California earlier in the day. Then he quickly launched into the usual insults he directs at some of those seeking the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination \u2015 in this instance, Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Vice President Joe Biden, whom he called \u201cPocahontas,\u201d \u201cCrazy Bernie\u201d and \u201cSleepy Joe,\u201d respectively.\nTrump also took aim at the federal law enforcement community, referring to some ousted FBI and Justice Department officials \u201cscum.\u201d\nThe rally, held in Green Bay, was the president\u2019s first such gathering since the findings of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe into Russia\u2019s interference with the 2016 presidential election, the Trump campaign\u2019s dealings with Russian officials and possible obstruction of justice by Trump were made public. The report said the investigation did not find sufficient evidence of a criminal conspiracy with the Russians, while declining to make a judgment of whether the president criminally obstructed justice. Attorney General William Barr \u2015 a Trump appointee \u2015 then ruled he did not.\n\u201cIf you look at what\u2019s happened with the scum that\u2019s leaving the very top of government ... these were dirty cops,\u201d Trump told his crowd. \u201cThese were dirty players.\u201d\nHe made similar remarks in June 2018, calling top FBI officials of the time \u201cscum.\u201d\nAt his rally, Trump highlighted his usual anti-immigration policies and again took credit for a controversial plan to send detained undocumented immigrants to so-called sanctuary cities where local officials have opted not to cooperate with federal immigration officials \u2015 a plan that surfaced earlier this month.\nTrump called it his \u201csick idea\u201d while bragging about it.\n\u201cWe\u2019re sending many of them to sanctuary cities, thank you very much,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not too happy about it. I\u2019m proud to tell you that was actually my sick idea.\u201d\nA Department of Homeland Security official had\u00a0said the agency had rejected a suggestion from Trump to release detained immigrants into cities who refuse to enforce the Trump administration\u2019s zero tolerance immigration policy. One day later, Trump said he was giving the plans \u201cstrong considerations.\u201d\nIn a tweet on Saturday, the Democratic National Committee called Trump\u2019s remarks on the plan \u201cdisgusting.\u201d\n\u201cTrump gleefully admits it was his \u2018sick idea\u2019 to use immigrants as pawns in his games of political retribution.\u201d\nWhile talking about foreign policy on Saturday, Trump defended his support for Saudi Arabia, whose Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is believed to have ordered for the gruesome murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\u201cLook, Saudi Arabia, very rich country,\u201d the president said.\n\u201cThey buy a lot from us, $450 billion they bought,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, you had people wanting to cut off Saudi Arabia. They bought $450 billion. I don\u2019t want to lose them!\u201d\nThe White House Correspondents\u2019 dinner not only was more subdued than\u00a0 Trump\u2019s rally, it was a more restrained affair than the event has been in previous years.\nHistorian Ron Chernow, who penned the famed 2004 biography of Alexander Hamilton that inspired the smash Broadway musical, was the featured speaker \u2015 a break from having a comic enlivening the gathering. He offered a strong yet tempered rebuke of the White House\u2019s treatment of the press.\n\u201cThe thing that worries me most is the sustained assault on truth,\u201d Chernow said. \u201cWhat is happening today is ... a relentless campaign against the very credibility of the news media.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s rally featured an appearance by White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who took note of controversy that surrounded last year\u2019s correspondents\u2019 dinner.\n\u201cLast year, this night, I was at a slightly different event, not quite the best welcome, so this is an amazing honor,\u201d Sanders said. She was referring to the roasting\u00a0by comedian Michelle Wolf\u00a0the targeted her and other administration officials who were attending the event.", "date": "\n04/28/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-fbi-scum-wisconsin-rally_n_5cc50f3fe4b04eb7ff96b682?b2", "tags": "credit calls officials \u2018 ex-fbi immigrant president saudi takes trump rally \u201d scum \u2015 sick justice plan"}
