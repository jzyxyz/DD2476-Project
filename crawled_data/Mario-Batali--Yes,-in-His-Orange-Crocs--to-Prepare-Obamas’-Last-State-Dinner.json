{"title": "Mario Batali (Yes, in His Orange Crocs) to Prepare Obamas\u2019 Last State Dinner", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Last month as President Obama met with world leaders in Manhattan during the final United Nations General Assembly of his tenure, Michelle Obama sneaked off to Greenwich Village to plan for some parting diplomatic flourishes of her own.\nFor about two hours at a private table at Babbo, on Waverly Place, Mrs. Obama sampled appetizers, entrees and desserts prepared by Mario Batali, the chef she had chosen to put together the last state dinner of the Obama era, honoring Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy.\nThe menu of dishes that ultimately made the cut for Tuesday night\u2019s dinner was being as closely guarded this weekend as any state secret, though an official preview was scheduled for Monday afternoon at the White House.\nOfficials would say only that the 500 guests could expect \u201ctraditional Italian dishes that have been ingrained in American cuisine\u201d \u2014 so, presumably, some of the more daring fare for which Mr. Batali is known, like goose liver ravioli, is not on the menu.\nThe dinner, in a lavishly decorated tent on the South Lawn, will be the 13th of Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency. The chef the Obamas enlisted to prepare it is something of a familiar figure at the White House \u2014 a celebrity restaurateur who is also a longtime supporter of Mrs. Obama\u2019s \u201cLet\u2019s Move\u201d initiative and other efforts to promote healthy eating.\n\u201cThese are some of my favorite people on the whole planet, and they\u2019re asking me to cook for the final state dinner of the presidency, and, oh, by the way, it\u2019s the Italians who are coming?\u201d Mr. Batali said in an interview. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t get better.\u201d\nBut that does not mean it isn\u2019t also intimidating. \u201cI\u2019d be lying to say I wasn\u2019t shaking in my boots a little bit,\u201d Mr. Batali said \u2014 or, more precisely, his signature orange Crocs, which he confirmed he would be wearing to cook at the White House. (\u201cIt\u2019s all I\u2019ve got,\u201d he said.)\nMr. Batali planned to arrive in the White House kitchen with four assistants early Monday and begin a frenzy of cooking and plating that would include five or six \u201ctest drives\u201d of each dish before the Tuesday dinner hour.\nWhile he has never pulled off anything quite like a formal seated dinner for two world leaders and hundreds of prominent guests, Mr. Batali said his strategy would be \u201cquite similar\u201d to the one he employs in his many acclaimed restaurants, where preparation is paramount.\n\u201cWe perceive it as the same type of thing as the dinner rush, but a little less complicated,\u201d Mr. Batali said, because the vast majority of diners will be eating the same thing, rather than choosing among 17 appetizers, 20 pastas and 15 to 18 main dishes as they would at Babbo.\nAt the White House, where even the edible is political, Mr. Batali will avoid the more adventurous dishes found on Babbo\u2019s menu, like the aforementioned ravioli, as well as the head cheese, tripe, pig foot and sweetbreads.\n\u201cI knew it was going to be something using almost 100 percent American ingredients, and nothing that would alienate anybody or frighten anybody or look like it was really fancy,\u201d Mr. Batali said. \u201cThe dishes were all inspired by Italian dishes, so they will be simple and recognizable, but each with something to delight and surprise.\u201d\nStill, Mr. Batali said he had tried to stay true to his culinary instincts, as other chefs who have prepared state dinners for the Obamas have done.\n\u201cI looked at the other dinners by chefs that I know,\u201d including Marcus Samuelsson, who prepared the India state dinner, the Obamas\u2019 first; Rick Bayless, who cooked the Mexico dinner; Masaharu Morimoto, who did Japan\u2019s; and Anita Lo, who was featured at the second China state dinner. \u201cThey didn\u2019t back away. They made food that was very indicative of their personal taste.\u201d\nMr. Batali knows his way around the White House, where he appeared in 2010 for an \u201cIron Chef\u201d battle that paired him with Emeril Lagasse against Bobby Flay and Cristeta Comerford, the White House executive chef. The teams cooked a menu showcasing Mrs. Obama\u2019s kitchen garden. \u201cThey resoundingly crushed us,\u201d Mr. Batali said.\nAnd last year, he accompanied Mrs. Obama to the Milan Expo for an event about nutrition.\nSo when it came time to collaborate with Mr. Batali on this week\u2019s dinner, Ms. Comerford and Susan Morrison, the White House pastry chef, knew what they were getting.\nMs. Comerford will prepare passed canap\u00e9s made with ingredients from the final harvest of the White House kitchen garden. Ms. Morrison has constructed 44 fall harvest dessert centerpieces, complete with pumpkins and cornucopias made of chocolate, and she will serve miniature pastries, including a sweet corn crema and blackberry cup, a homage to one of Mr. Batali\u2019s signature desserts.\nThe event, to be capped off by a performance by Gwen Stefani, will be the Obamas\u2019 last chance to put their singular stamp on the button-down ritual of state dinners. Their debut, a 2009 dinner in honor of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India, was marred by a party-crashing couple whose unauthorized entry later prompted a congressional inquiry.\nSeven years and a dozen dinners later, the East Wing is well practiced in staging the kind of affair the Obamas want.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019ve got it down to a science, because there are so many details and logistics that go into making a state dinner a success, but we do know what it takes,\u201d said Deesha Dyer, the White House social secretary.\nThis time, however, the process has been bittersweet, as the White House staff grows increasingly conscious that its time is drawing to a close.\n\u201cThere is a little bit of nostalgia and beauty in knowing that you\u2019re bringing this together for the last time under this roof,\u201d Ms. Dyer said.\nMr. Batali said that he had waited for eight years for an invitation to cook at the White House, and that he was \u201cproud to have made the list\u201d of chefs who had the privilege.\n\u201cKnowing this is the last one, I only hope the meal lives up to the occasion,\u201d he said.", "date": "Oct. 16, 2016", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/17/us/politics/mario-batali-obama-dinner.html", "tags": "dinner mario crocs \u201d batali obamas white yes house last state obama orange prepare"}
