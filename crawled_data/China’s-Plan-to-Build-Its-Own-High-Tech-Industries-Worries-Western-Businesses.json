Indeed, the Chinese government\u2019s plan says Chinese industries that benefit should own as much as 80 percent of their home market in just eight years.\n\u201cThe Chinese make it clear that they want to be the global champion\u201d and are trying to carve out market share now, said Joerg Wuttke, the president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, which wrote the report.\nThe plan\u2019s mechanism is simple: It would provide large, low-interest loans from state-owned investment funds and development banks; assistance in buying foreign competitors; and extensive research subsidies, all with the goal of making China largely self-sufficient in the targeted industries.\nAlthough European and American government officials have expressed misgivings about the plan, the Chinese government has made clear in recent days that it plans to press on.\n\u201cWe will fully implement our plan for developing strategic emerging industries,\u201d Premier Li Keqiang said in his annual speech to the National People\u2019s Congress on Sunday. \u201cWe will accelerate R. & D. on and commercialization of new materials, artificial intelligence, integrated circuits, bio-pharmacy, 5G mobile communications and other technologies, and develop industrial clusters in these fields.\u201d\nIn addition to the sectors Mr. Li cited, the plan also covers the manufacturing of aircraft, robots, electric cars, rail equipment, ships and agricultural machinery. China seeks to wean itself off imports from companies like Boeing, Airbus, General Electric, Siemens, Nissan, Renault, Samsung and Intel.\nThe Chinese government has long worried that the country\u2019s economy is still too concentrated in fairly low-end manufacturing. Making and assembling Apple iPhone components, for instance, is done by hundreds of thousands of workers in China, while the better-paid, value-added design and marketing work is done in the United States, although by many fewer employees.\nAlthough a large-scale shift of factories from the West to China has created tens of millions of Chinese jobs, the country\u2019s leaders worry that an increasingly well-educated younger generation is rejecting factory work for higher-paid office jobs.\nBut the report by the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China was lengthy and critical. The United States Chamber of Commerce in Washington plans to issue a similar report next week.\nThe Chinese Communist Party has long relied on five-year plans to guide national economic growth. But \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d sets out broader targets.\n\u201cIt feels like a five-year plan, but this time not only domestic but international,\u201d Mr. Wuttke said.\nThe timing is delicate. President Trump had campaigned about confronting China on trade and currency issues. He has not yet done so, but his advisers have been considering a revision to corporate taxes that would effectively impose a 20 percent tariff on all imports, not just from China.\nChina is also laying the legal groundwork for challenging at the World Trade Organization a refusal by the United States to accept that China is a market economy for purposes of anti-dumping trade cases. It will make a similar challenge to European Union rules.\nChina\u2019s top Commerce Ministry officials will hold their annual media briefing Saturday and may outline China\u2019s trade policy goals for this year.\nAlong with subsidies at home, the Chinese plan calls for a shopping spree overseas.\n\u201cChinese high-tech investments need to be interpreted as building blocks of an overarching political program. It aims to systematically acquire cutting-edge technology and generate large-scale technology transfer. In the long run, China wants to obtain control over the most profitable segments of the global supply chains and production networks,\u201d according to a report on \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d released in December by the Mercator Institute for China Studies, a German think tank.\nFor all of its funding and targets, analysts are divided about how effective the policies will be. Critics point out that its structure could lead to overspending by local governments and inefficient investment.\nStill, the Mercator report said that the policy is likely to bolster a \u201csmall vanguard\u201d of leading Chinese companies, adding, \u201cThese front-runners are likely to dominate their sectors on the Chinese market and become fierce competitors in international markets.\u201d", "date": "March 7, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/07/business/china-trade-manufacturing-europe.html", "tags": "european western report china industries worries build \u201d chinese government high-tech plan businesses"}
