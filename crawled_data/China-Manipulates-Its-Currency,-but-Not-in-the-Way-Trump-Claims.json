{"title": "China Manipulates Its Currency, but Not in the Way Trump Claims", "content": "HONG KONG \u2014 In Monday\u2019s presidential debate, Donald Trump repeated one of his frequent criticisms of China: It keeps its currency artificially cheap.\nOf all the countries in the world, he said, China is \u201cthe best ever\u201d at devaluing its currency, the renminbi. That gives its companies a big \u2014 and unfair \u2014 advantage when selling its goods abroad, the argument goes.\nThat\u2019s no longer quite the case. Nowadays, China faces the opposite problem: It is shoring up its currency while the rest of the world is trying to push it down.\nThat change speaks to an enormous shift in China\u2019s economic fortunes and to its position in the world. Not long ago, it was still an up-and-coming country looking for ways to nurture an economic boom that was lifting millions of people out of poverty.\nToday, China is a world power with ambitions to call more of the shots in world economic affairs. Beijing is no longer content to cede that role to the likes of Brussels, London, Tokyo and Washington.\nWith that shift in attitude comes a change in the way China thinks about its money. A decade ago, China saw its currency as merely a tool to help its factories sell goods. That meant keeping it weak.\nNow, China sees the renminbi as an instrument of its growing power. If more people around the world hold renminbi in their wallets, the thinking goes, then China will have greater say in the decisions they make. Someday, Beijing hopes, the renminbi may even rival the dollar as the world\u2019s de facto currency.\nWith that in mind, China has moved in recent years to make the renminbi more appealing. On Saturday, when the International Monetary Fund is set to formally add the renminbi to its basket of reserve currencies, a move that will lump it in with the dollar, the pound, the euro and the yen, it will take another step in that direction.\nBut in the year since the monetary fund first said it would bestow that status on the renminbi, the Chinese currency has become less attractive. Despite Mr. Trump\u2019s contention \u2014 which, like his assertions about Japan, harks back to another era \u2014 many economists say they believe the renminbi is overvalued, not undervalued.\nTony Gao, a senior at the University of Southern California, helped found a start-up called Easy Transfer three years ago. The company helps Chinese parents with children going to American schools exchange their renminbi for dollars. But business growth is down this year, he said, because many affluent Chinese have already changed their renminbi for dollars.\n\u201cA lot of them already have acknowledged this depreciation,\u201d Mr. Gao said, adding that he was thinking of switching his renminbi to dollars, too. \u201cNow I\u2019m actually on the edge.\u201d\nThe situation with the renminbi:\nUnder the traditional rules of economics, the value of a country\u2019s currency will go up if the world moves more money there. That is what should have happened in China. People around the world poured money into the country as they bought its products and as companies built factories and invested in China\u2019s growth.\nInstead, China largely kept its currency at a steady value compared with the dollar. That contributed to imbalances in the country, but it kept the renminbi weak.\nFor China\u2019s manufacturers, a weak currency is ideal. If the renminbi is at, say, eight to the dollar, then a $100 widget translates into an 800 renminbi sale. At a stronger seven renminbi to the dollar, that same $100 widget generates only 700 renminbi in sales.\nThat is not ideal for the American factories that compete with Chinese rivals. In previous years, China\u2019s currency policy angered American lawmakers and took center stage in the United States\u2019 dealings with China.\nFor starters, China\u2019s growth rate slowed, and the flow of money into the country moderated. Both factors have led economists to say that the renminbi might be fairly valued, or even overvalued. The verdict, for many investors: China\u2019s currency is poised to weaken.\nThere are other forces at work. China has taken steps over the past few years to relax its hold on the renminbi. That makes it easier for banks and merchants abroad to save the renminbi or to use it in transactions. Manufacturing has also declined as a major growth driver in the country\u2019s economy, as the government pushes to build its growing consumer and high-tech sectors.\nSince August of last year, when Beijing surprised global markets with a one-time devaluation of its currency, investors have been broadly seeking to unload their renminbi in favor of dollars.\nIn Hong Kong, the biggest offshore center for renminbi banking, deposits of the Chinese currency peaked in December 2014 and have since fallen by a third.\nFor five years since 2010, the renminbi had made small but progressive gains as a global payment currency, as measured by transactions processed on the Swift global payment system. But that usage crested in August 2015 at 2.8 percent of transactions, and it has declined steadily since then, to 1.9 percent in August.\nChina has spent hundreds of billions of dollars from its foreign reserves over the past year to support the value of the renminbi and to prevent it from weakening more drastically. A sharp fall could lead even more people to find ways to convert their renminbi into other currencies, resulting in an exodus of money from the country. More broadly, it could undermine Beijing\u2019s case that the renminbi is worth holding.\nEven long-term supporters of the renminbi now seem to see the currency\u2019s pause as perhaps inevitable.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been the strongest currency in the world for the last 10 years or so, and anything that strong should consolidate, should have a correction,\u201d said Jim Rogers, a Singapore-based investor who is well known for being bullish on China. \u201cIs it a normal market correction or being jiggled? Maybe some of both,\u201d he added.\nMr. Rogers, who made his name in the 1970s as a co-founder of the Quantum Fund with George Soros, said he retained a positive long-term view of the Chinese currency. But he said the renminbi could continue to come under selling pressure in the next year or so, as investors flock to the perceived safety of the dollar.\nSome of the renminbi\u2019s declines, Mr. Rogers added, were \u201ca self-fulfilling prophecy.\u201d\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s not convertible, people feel trapped and want to get out,\u201d he said.\nLonger term, despite the I.M.F.\u2019s planned move, few expect the renminbi to rival the dollar as a haven, or even as a significant reserve currency, unless China pushes forward with dramatic legal and financial changes.\nInclusion in the monetary fund\u2019s basket is \u201ca symbolically momentous event but is unlikely by itself to be a game changer in global finance,\u201d said Eswar S. Prasad, a professor at Cornell University and a former top I.M.F. official for China. He is also the author of a book called \u201cGaining Currency: The Rise of the Renminbi.\u201d\n\u201cNotwithstanding the I.M.F.\u2019s imprimatur, the renminbi will not become a significant reserve currency unless China has better-developed and well-regulated financial markets,\u201d Mr. Prasad added.", "date": "Sept. 30, 2016", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/01/business/dealbook/china-trump-yuan-devaluation.html", "tags": "country world china renminbi currency way claims \u201d trump manipulates dollar years"}
