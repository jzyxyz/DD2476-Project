But the clampdown has complicated relations with China at a particularly sensitive moment.\nThe decision to stop five of Iran\u2019s biggest customers from buying its oil was an audacious strike at Tehran\u2019s lifeline \u2014 one million barrels of oil exports daily, fully half of which go to China. The order was also aimed at India, Japan, South Korea and Turkey, all countries that trade robustly with the United States.\nAll are also partners with the United States on major security and diplomatic issues that do not involve Iran.\n\u201cWe will no longer grant exemptions,\u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in announcing that current sanctions waivers to the five nations would expire on May 2, clearing the way for American economic penalties against all companies or financial institutions that continue to take part in transactions linked to buying Iranian oil.\nBy withdrawing from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, and phasing in sanctions, the Trump administration has sought to cripple the Iranian government and weaken the power of its ruling clerics. Mr. Pompeo said Iran has earned about $50 billion annually from oil sales, accounting for as much as 40 percent of government revenues.\nThe Iranian economy is already reeling from sanctions that have also led to a shortage in critical medicine, and Iranian-backed militias have been forced to tighten their payrolls.\nBy retracting its oil exemptions, the Trump administration is encroaching on China\u2019s energy security even as Washington is trying to strike an all-important trade deal with Beijing. The United States also needs China\u2019s help in controlling North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons development.\nThe Chinese government immediately pushed back against the decision on the waivers, although analysts said both Beijing and Washington will be careful not to jeopardize their trade talks.\n\u201cChina consistently opposes U.S. unilateral sanctions,\u201d said Geng Shuang, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman. \u201cThe Chinese government is committed to protecting the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises.\u201d\nMr. Pompeo said the United States has been in \u201cconstant discussions with allies and partners\u201d to find an alternative source of oil, including the United Arab Emirates. It is also further embracing Saudi Arabia to punish Iran but avoid damaging the global economy.\nBut the Trump administration\u2019s increased coordination with Saudi Arabia, to ensure that oil markets remain fully supplied, follows persistent and bipartisan criticism in Congress of the kingdom\u2019s human rights record, its war in Yemen and its role in the October killing of the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was a resident of the United States.\nSaudi Arabia is an avowed enemy of Iran. It has also been coordinating with Russia in recent years to manage global oil prices. Should Russia balk at increasing its own output to stymie the United States, oil prices could soar and hurt the global economy.\nInternational oil prices, which had already climbed $20 a barrel this year, soared by 3 percent after the first reports on Sunday of the administration\u2019s policy shift. With the summertime surge in energy use and the 2020 elections drawing closer, President Trump has railed on Twitter against higher gasoline prices that have resulted from rising oil prices. Those prices are now at roughly their highest level in six months.\nIran reacted angrily, threatening to close the Strait of Hormuz, a move that would effectively sabotage the world economy.\n\u201cIn the event of any threats, we will not have the slightest hesitation to protect and defend Iran\u2019s waterway,\u201d said Alireza Tangsiri, the head of the Revolutionary Guards\u2019 naval force, according to state media.\nAmong all of the complications, one stands out. China is Iran\u2019s largest oil buyer and has been increasing its purchases this year, contrary to Trump administration demands that it gradually bring the imports to zero.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to zero,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to zero across the board.\u201d\nThe United States and China have been closing in on an agreement that would cover a wide range of trade issues.\nNegotiations are expected to continue over the next two weeks, first in Beijing and then in Washington, to resolve several sticking points, including removing current tariffs. If those gaps are bridged, the two sides will look to schedule a signing meeting between Mr. Trump and President Xi Jinping of China in May or June, said a person who has been briefed on the talks and spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss them.\nAny move by Beijing to keep buying Iranian oil \u2014 which analysts predicted China almost certainly will find some way to do \u2014 would force the United States to decide whether to impose sanctions on Chinese financial institutions, which are increasingly important in the worldwide economy. China could also set up a new vehicle as an alternative to using the current banking mechanisms, as the European nations have done to keep doing some business with Iran.\n\u201cIran sanctions are going to be a big challenge for the U.S.-Chinese relationship,\u201d said Jason Bordoff, the director of Columbia University\u2019s Center on Global Energy Policy and a former energy adviser to President Barack Obama.\nHe added that if Chinese imports do not drop quickly, the American sanctions could be applied to Beijing\u2019s central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China.\nThe United States and China are already at odds over an incendiary case involving Iran sanctions.\nIn January, Canadian authorities arrested a top Chinese technology executive, Meng Wanzhou, at the Vancouver airport at the request of American officials. The Justice Department is seeking her extradition to face charges of helping her company, Huawei, evade sanctions on Iran in a scheme that involved tricking American banks.\nThat case has been criticized by Chinese officials, who have said it is motivated purely by politics. It also heightened fury and grievances from the Chinese government over sanctions imposed by the United States on Iran in the administrations of both Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump. Chinese companies have many business ties to Iran.\nThe case of Ms. Meng shows how tensions over various issues could affect the trade talks. Mr. Trump has suggested he could help with Ms. Meng\u2019s release if China cooperates in the negotiations. The oil issue could also end up as a bargaining chip in those talks.\nLeaders of the other four nations are also certain to be upset by Monday\u2019s announcement.\nThe United States needs to keep frictions at a minimum with South Korea and Japan, both of which are key partners in a policy to deal with North Korea. Turkish officials in Washington last week asked for a continued waiver for oil purchases, with Ibrahim Kalin, a senior adviser to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, noting that \u201cwe have a long border with Iran, we have cultural ties.\u201d\nAnd India, which imports four-fifths of its oil, depends on Iran as one of its main suppliers. Monday\u2019s decision could have an immediate effect on Indian financial markets if it causes oil prices to jump.\nAmerican officials had granted six-month oil purchase waivers last November to eight governments after imposing major sanctions on Iran. In recent weeks, they had debated whether to continue the exemptions for the five nations still buying oil from Iran.\nFor all of its complications with Washington, Saudi Arabia enthusiastically endorsed the end of the exceptions. The rise in global oil prices finance the kingdom\u2019s budget and may attract international investors to its proposed initial public offering of Saudi Aramco, which has been delayed over the past year.\n\u201cSaudi Arabia will coordinate with fellow oil producers to ensure adequate supplies are available to consumers while ensuring the global oil market does not go out of balance,\u201d said Khalid al-Falih, the Saudi minister of energy.\nBut some experts warned that relying on Saudi Arabia presents other threats to the stability of the Persian Gulf, including possible Iranian cyberattacks on Saudi energy facilities. \u201cThe disruption of Saudi oil production could systematically rattle markets,\u201d according to a research note by the consultancy Eurasia Group on Monday.\nRussia, which is able to deliver more oil supplies, also stands to profit. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said last week that he was satisfied with the rise in prices, and that it was premature to reconsider production levels for the second half of the year.\nSince the administration withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal nearly one year ago, oil prices have been on an erratic ride.\nOil prices first soared to more than $85 a barrel as tensions between the United States and Iran escalated, before plunging to around $50 after the administration granted the waivers six months ago. As crude prices have rebounded since January, so have prices for American drivers at the pump.\nThe average price of regular gasoline nationwide has increased by 23 cents over the past month alone, to $2.84, 8 cents higher than a year ago. They are bound to go higher during the summer driving season, energy analysts said, especially if American sanctions remain against Venezuela and political crises persist in Libya, two other major oil producers.", "date": "April 22, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/22/world/middleeast/us-iran-oil-sanctions-.html", "tags": "iran sanctions china u.s. united states prices nations oil buying defiant stop iranian also moves"}
