But the stunt left many people baffled as they struggled to decipher what the message actually meant.\nSome believed that the banner was taking aim at racism:\nOthers criticized the protesters:\nA few tweeters wondered how the fans were able to get the banner past security and into the stadium in the first place:\nBut the majority were just bewildered by its questionable phrasing:\nThe protesters later revealed to CSN New England that the banner was intended to be an anti-racist statement.\n\u201cWe want to remind everyone that just as baseball is fundamental to American culture and history, so too is racism,\u201d one of the protesters told the news outlet.\n\u201cWhite people need to wake up to this reality before white supremacy can truly be dismantled,\u201d the protester said. \u201cWe urge anyone who is interested in learning more or taking action to contact their local racial justice organization.\u201d\nIn a statement, Red Sox officials said the protesters\u2019\u00a0actions were \u201cin violation of the club\u2019s policy prohibiting signs of any kind to be hung or affixed to the ballpark.\u201d", "date": "\n09/14/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/boston-red-sox-racism-banner-fenway-park_n_59ba2529e4b02da0e13f3501", "tags": "american baseball sox game left red unfurl racism protesters boston \u201d banner fans sign"}
