{"title": "Tim and Eric Figure Out How to Do the Wrong Thing, Perfectly", "content": "At the end of their live show currently touring the country, Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim \u2014 better known as Tim and Eric \u2014 leave the stage after introducing their final act, a third performer who comes off as a parody of a 1980s observational comic, his jokes drowned out by loud music.\nOn a recent Friday night at Town Hall, the audience seemed confused by this spectacle. Was the show over? Should they leave? Some did. Others watched the gesticulating comic until Mr. Heidecker returned and escorted him offstage.\nIt was classic Tim and Eric: remixing the tropes of stale show business, gleefully baffling the audience and throwing spitballs at comedy. \u201cThere\u2019s a bad taste in my mouth when people even call me a comedian,\u201d Mr. Wareheim, 41, said backstage before the show.\nThe tour is celebrating the 10th anniversary of the premiere of \u201cTim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!,\u201d the Adult Swim sketch show that ended in 2010 but has had an enduring impact. \u201cWe get labeled anti-comedy,\u201d Mr. Heidecker, 41, added, clarifying: \u201cWe just have a different set of rules.\u201d\nThose rules \u2014 choppy editing, a lo-fi look, cartoonish sound design, periodic non sequiturs and spilled bodily fluids \u2014 created a signature style that has infiltrated advertising and online humor and given birth to a new caffeinated era in sketch comedy. Even if you don\u2019t know Tim and Eric, you\u2019ve seen their influence throughout the culture.\nAping the grainy image of late-night infomercials and cable-access television, the campy \u201cAwesome Show\u201d aesthetic, particularly its meticulously punchy sound effects, has lodged in the brains of a generation of comics. You can see its influence in parodies on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and \u201cPortlandia\u201d (executive produced by Jonathan Krisel, who got his start working on \u201cAwesome Show\u201d). Even though it was made for television, Tim and Eric\u2019s kinetic quick-hit comedy is perfectly suited to the internet, where its inspiration is perhaps most evident in viral videos like \u201cToo Many Cooks\u201d and the brilliant deconstructions of Vic Berger, who was discovered by Mr. Heidecker and hired for his movie review spoof, \u201cOn Cinema.\u201d\nWith their production company Abso Lutely, Tim and Eric have also leveraged the success of \u201cAwesome Show\u201d into their own comedy fief, doing for offbeat comics what Judd Apatow has for more mainstream ones \u2014 helping bring them to a larger audience. Mr. Heidecker and Mr. Wareheim (a star of \u201cMaster of None\u201d) were executive producers on \u201cNathan for You\u201d (Comedy Central), the most ambitious prank show ever broadcast, and their company helped produce \u201cThe Eric Andre Show\u201d (Adult Swim) and \u201cComedy Bang! Bang!\u201d (IFC), two bracing deconstructions of talk shows that are clearly descendants of \u201cAwesome Show.\u201d\nTim and Eric \u2014 who have also had a huge effect on advertising, making some of the strangest high-profile spots in the past decade, like a commercial for frozen pizza rolls that seemed intended to insult its product \u2014 have become a stamp of approval for adventurous comedy.\n\u201cHaving the Abso Lutely name gives you a positive association,\u201d said Kate Berlant, whose \u201c555,\u201d a Vimeo series with John Early, was made with the company. \u201cHow they dwell in the moment that isn\u2019t the laugh, the sense of being almost embarrassed to be part of comedy \u2014 I relate to that.\u201d\nIn a cultural landscape where the term \u201calt comedy\u201d has lost any concrete meaning, you could do worse than what\u2019s associated with Tim and Eric.\n\u201cWe feel like we\u2019re the dads of the outsiders,\u201d Mr. Wareheim said.\nMany elements of Tim and Eric\u2019s humor are actually rooted in long comedic traditions. They weren\u2019t the first to mock infomercials and shouting salesmen on television, and their embrace of scatological excess follows in the footsteps of countless others. Their bursts of deliriously random nonsense evoke Monty Python, and their preference for eccentric amateurs instead of comics is similar to the inclinations that turned Larry (Bud) Melman into an unlikely star on late-night television.\nWhat makes Tim and Eric truly innovative, however, is the process and delivery system for their giddy style, generating jokes as much in the editing room as on the page.\nWhen \u201cTim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!\u201d had its premiere in 2007, few in the mainstream press grasped this 11-minute show\u2019s importance as a radical break from the past. But some comics did.\nScott Aukerman, the comedian who created the Earwolf podcast network and \u201cBetween Two Ferns,\u201d recalls being stunned at a screening of the first episode. \u201cThey were using editing and sound effects in a way I had never seen,\u201d he said.\nTheir quick-hit sketches are filled with cartoonish noises (squishes, snaps), abrupt edits, star wipes, zooms held seconds too long and freeze frames emphasizing contorted faces. Tim and Eric mock clumsy cable access, for sure, but also venerate the possibilities of terrible acting or the kinds of mistakes that reveal an honest moment in the middle of the artifice of show business.\nOne of their most distinctive sketches began when they realized that the scenes they were shooting about an indifferent student at a Roman Catholic school were not working. The jokes weren\u2019t landing. But with the editor Doug Lussenhop, they tossed aside the premise and reinvented the sketch in postproduction, zeroing in on one strange line they said in unison \u2014 \u201cOooh, mama\u201d \u2014 repeating it in a loop over the same images of Tim and Eric throwing tantrums in a basement, adding awkward pauses and clumsy zooms. It\u2019s a bizarre, grotesque and dreamy sketch, one that has more in common with \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d than \u201cKey & Peele.\u201d\nBob Odenkirk, who was Tim and Eric\u2019s original champion and the first of many well-known guests to appear regularly in their work, including Will Ferrell, Zach Galifianakis and John C. Reilly, compares their process to the comedic version of a D.J.\u2019s remix. \u201cThey see things at a different speed and different way, a modern mind-set,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThe thing that\u2019s unique is done in post, so you think any editor could do it. Just do the wrong thing. But it has to be the perfect wrong thing at the right time with a rhythm to it.\u201d\nTim and Eric\u2019s comedy has a very specific, unpredictable pace, getting to the premise quickly, and then instead of simply building momentum, their scenes are a series of startling pivots. They are just as likely to abandon a premise abruptly or embrace confusion. It\u2019s part of why they used amateur actors, many of whom have become improbable cult stars. \u201cIt added to the mystery,\u201d Mr. Wareheim said. \u201cIt makes people think: Is this real? Is this acting or not? That\u2019s exciting to us.\u201d\nMr. Heidecker and Mr. Wareheim \u2014 who have a busy year on Adult Swim with \u201cDecker,\u201d Mr. Heidecker\u2019s Jack Bauer spoof, running now, and \u201cTim & Eric\u2019s Bedtime Stories,\u201d their horror series, returning in the fall \u2014 share an appreciation for jokes that shock or even annoy. This abrasive instinct is the source of some of their scatological excess, like an infamous scene from their 2012 film, \u201cTim & Eric\u2019s Billion Dollar Movie,\u201d that includes perhaps the least sanitary bath in movie history. This truly disgusting sequence helped earn them a stampede of walkouts at Sundance, but also the kind of notoriety with a shelf life among fans of cult film.\n\u201cThe reason we did that is we knew it would be a ruckus, a \u2018Jackass\u2019 moment,\u201d Mr. Wareheim said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of my favorite movies. People are screaming. It\u2019s like an event, visceral. We always wanted our show to be like that.\u201d\nMr. Heidecker leaned in to clarify the point: \u201cWe\u2019re never trying to alienate. That\u2019s not the goal,\u201d he said, chuckling at himself. \u201cIt\u2019s the byproduct of the work we do.\u201d", "date": "July 23, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/23/arts/tim-and-eric-awesome-show-great-job-tour.html", "tags": "eric tim perfectly show comedy thing \u201d heidecker wrong \u2014 figure"}
