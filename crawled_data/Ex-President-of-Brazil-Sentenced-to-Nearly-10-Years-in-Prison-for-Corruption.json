{"title": "Ex-President of Brazil Sentenced to Nearly 10 Years in Prison for Corruption", "content": "RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 The former president of Brazil, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, was found guilty of corruption and money laundering on Wednesday and sentenced to nearly 10 years in prison, a stunning setback for a politician who has wielded enormous influence across Latin America for decades.\nThe case against Mr. da Silva, who raised Brazil\u2019s profile on the world stage as president from 2003 to 2010, stemmed from charges that he and his wife illegally received about $1.1 million in improvements and expenses from a construction company for a beachfront apartment.\nIn exchange, prosecutors said, the company was able to obtain lucrative contracts from Petrobras, the state-controlled oil giant.\nHis conviction tarnishes the legacy of one of Brazil\u2019s most commanding political figures, a charismatic leader who grew up poor, challenged the military dictatorship and nurtured global ambitions for his nation, helping to land the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympics.\n\u201cThis goes far beyond himself and his political career, which is seriously damaged. It\u2019s Brazil\u2019s reputation,\u201d said Christopher Sabatini, executive director of Global Americans, a research group in New York. \u201cHe was a brand. Brand Brazil.\u201d\nBut Brazil\u2019s economic fortunes eventually turned and, plagued by scandals, Mr. da Silva\u2019s leftist Workers\u2019 Party lost the presidency last year when the Senate impeached his handpicked successor, Dilma Rousseff, in a power struggle that consumed the nation.\nMr. da Silva, 71, who has called the charges against him a \u201cfarce,\u201d has been planning a political comeback. Despite multiple corruption allegations against him, he has announced his intention to run for president in next year\u2019s election and has been widely considered a leading contender.\nThe ruling could be a crippling blow to his aspirations.\nJudge Sergio Moro, who issued Wednesday\u2019s verdict, said that under Brazilian law, Mr. da Silva would be ineligible to run for office for twice as long as his sentence, or 19 years.\nLegal scholars interpreted the ruling to mean that Mr. da Silva could still run for president while the case is being appealed. But if he fails on appeal, they said, it could either leave the Workers\u2019 Party without an obvious candidate in next year\u2019s vote or prevent him from taking office.\nThe conviction is the latest salvo by Brazil\u2019s judicial branch, which has declared war on the country\u2019s entrenched culture of corruption. Brazil\u2019s current president, Michel Temer, was charged last month with corruption, part of a near constant stream of allegations and charges that have ripped through the nation\u2019s political establishment in recent years.\nJudge Moro, who oversees cases stemming from a broad graft scandal surrounding the state-controlled oil company, said Mr. da Silva\u2019s actions were part of a \u201cscheme of systemic corruption\u201d at Petrobras.\n\u201cThe president of the republic has enormous responsibilities,\u201d Judge Moro wrote. \u201cAs such, his culpability is also\u201d enormous when he commits crimes, he added.\nMr. da Silva presided over a period of robust economic growth in Brazil and remains a widely popular figure, credited with leading a social transformation that lifted millions from poverty in a nation with one of the world\u2019s biggest disparities between rich and poor.\nDespite the corruption allegations against him and his party, Mr. da Silva has been leading in recent public opinion polls on the election. Judge Moro, the judge who convicted him, is often cited as Mr. da Silva\u2019s closest rival in hypothetical matchups in the presidential race, though Judge Moro has ruled out running for office.\n\u201cWe view this as an attempt to push Lula out of the electoral process,\u201d said Senator Gleisi Hoffmann, who recently took the helm of the Workers\u2019 Party. \u201cA presidential election without the participation of Lula is fraudulent and undemocratic. If you want to take him out of the running, then put up a candidate and run against him in the electoral booth.\u201d\nMr. da Silva\u2019s lawyers said in a statement issued Wednesday night that the former president is innocent. They called him the victim of a politicized prosecution, \u201ca famous strategy that has been used to brutal effect by various dictatorships throughout history.\u201d\nIn the verdict, the judge said that the former president had sought to intimidate the court, which the judge argued could be grounds for ordering his immediate arrest. Yet Judge Moro deemed it \u201cprudent\u201d to allow Mr. da Silva to remain free pending an appeal.\nSending a former president to jail would be a \u201ctraumatic\u201d event, he wrote.\nWhile Mr. da Silva\u2019s conviction involves relatively modest sums, especially compared with the staggering scale of some corruption cases in Brazil, prosecutors have described him as the mastermind of an enormous kickback scheme that enabled his party to buy support in Congress.\nThe case against him began with an investigation into money laundering at a gas station. But as prosecutors continued digging, they said they discovered billions of dollars\u2019 worth of bribes involving Petrobras and powerful contractors like Odebrecht, a large construction company with deep ties across the hemisphere. The case \u2014 which became known as the Lava Jato, or Car Wash, scandal \u2014 has ensnared other powerful politicians and put dozens of lawmakers under a cloud of suspicion.\nEduardo Cunha, the former speaker of the House, was sentenced in March to 15 years in jail for money laundering and corruption uncovered during the Petrobras investigation. And Mr. Temer, the current president, is working furiously to avoid being put on trial, hoping to persuade lawmakers not to send the charges against him to the Supreme Court, the only venue where senior sitting politicians can be prosecuted.\nThe investigations have left Brazilians with few prominent politicians untainted by allegations of corruption. Wary politicians, meanwhile, have been considering passing an amnesty law to shield themselves, arguing that such protection is warranted to avert a collapse of the political system.\nMauricio Santoro, a political scientist at the Rio de Janeiro State University, called the sentence against Mr. da Silva a momentous turning point in a deeply polarized nation.\n\u201cWe have almost half of the country wanting Lula to be president and the other half wanting him jailed,\u201d Mr. Santoro said. \u201cThis puts a huge responsibility in the hands of the judges\u201d ruling on the appeal.\nEven if Mr. da Silva wins the appeal, he said, the case adds to the sense that Brazil\u2019s crusading judiciary has changed the rules of the game for politicians. Past presidents widely suspected of corruption managed to keep prosecutors at bay.\n\u201cWe are living in a very different Brazil,\u201d he said.", "date": "July 12, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/12/world/americas/brazil-lula-da-silva-corruption.html", "tags": "da corruption president nearly judge \u201d silva sentenced prison brazil years ex-president"}
