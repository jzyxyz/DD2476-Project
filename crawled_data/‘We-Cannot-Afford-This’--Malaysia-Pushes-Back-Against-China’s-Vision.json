{"title": "\u2018We Cannot Afford This\u2019: Malaysia Pushes Back Against China\u2019s Vision", "content": "KUANTAN, Malaysia \u2014 In the world\u2019s most vital maritime chokepoint, through which much of Asian trade passes, a Chinese power company is investing in a deepwater port large enough to host an aircraft carrier. Another state-owned Chinese company is revamping a harbor along the fiercely contested South China Sea.\nNearby, a rail network mostly financed by a Chinese government bank is being built to speed Chinese goods along a new Silk Road. And a Chinese developer is creating four artificial islands that could become home to nearly three-quarters of a million people and are being heavily marketed to Chinese citizens.\nEach of these projects is being built in Malaysia, a Southeast Asian democracy at the heart of China\u2019s effort to gain global influence.\nBut where Malaysia once led the pack in courting Chinese investment, it is now on the front edge of a new phenomenon: a pushback against Beijing as nations fear becoming overly indebted for projects that are neither viable nor necessary \u2014 except in their strategic value to China or use in propping up friendly strongmen.\nAt the end of a five-day visit in Beijing, Malaysia\u2019s new leader, Mahathir Mohamad, said on Tuesday that he was halting two major Chinese-linked projects, worth more than $22 billion, amid accusations that his predecessor\u2019s government knowingly signed bad deals with China to bail out a graft-plagued state investment fund and bankroll his continuing grip on power.\nHis message throughout his meetings with officials, and in public comments, has been unambiguous.\n\u201cWe do not want a situation where there is a new version of colonialism happening because poor countries are unable to compete with rich countries,\u201d Mr. Mahathir said on Monday at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing after meeting with Premier Li Keqiang.\nFor a time it appeared that China\u2019s standard playbook for gaining favor was working in Malaysia. It had successfully courted Mr. Mahathir\u2019s predecessor, Najib Razak, with easy loans and showcase projects, and secured deals that were of strategic value for its ambitions.\nBut in May, Mr. Najib was voted out of office by an electorate tired of the corruption scandals swirling around him, some of which involved China\u2019s highest-profile investment deals in Malaysia.\nMr. Mahathir, 93, was voted into office with a mandate that included getting the country out from under its suffocating debt \u2014 roughly $250 billion of it, some of it owed to Chinese companies.\nFrom Sri Lanka and Djibouti to Myanmar and Montenegro, many recipients of cash from Chinese\u2019s huge infrastructure financing campaign, the Belt and Road Initiative, have discovered that Chinese investment brings with it less-savory accompaniments, including closed bidding processes that result in inflated contracts and influxes of Chinese labor at the expense of local workers.\nFears are growing that China is using its overseas spending spree to gain footholds in some of the world\u2019s most strategic places, and perhaps even deliberately luring vulnerable nations into debt traps to increase China\u2019s dominion as the United States\u2019 influence fades in the developing world.\n\u201cThe Chinese must have been thinking, \u2018We can pick things up for cheap here,\u2019\u201d said Khor Yu Leng, a Malaysian political economist who has been researching China\u2019s investments in Southeast Asia. \u201cThey\u2019ve got enough patient capital to play the long game, wait for the local boys to overextend and then come in and take all that equity for China.\u201d\nIn his action in Beijing on Tuesday, Mr. Mahathir said he was halting a contract for the China Communications Construction Company to build the East Coast Rail Link, thought to have cost the government around $20 billion, along with a $2.5 billion agreement for an arm of a Chinese energy giant to construct gas pipelines. He had earlier suspended the projects, leading some analysts to believe he wanted to renegotiate the terms during his China trip. Instead, he announced that the deals were off for now.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about borrowing too much money, which we cannot afford and cannot repay because we don\u2019t need these projects in Malaysia,\u201d Mr. Mahathir said.\nA Pentagon report released last week said \u201cThe \u2018Belt and Road Initiative\u2019 (BRI) is intended to develop strong economic ties with other countries, shape their interests to align with China\u2019s and deter confrontation or criticism of China\u2019s approach to sensitive issues.\u201d\n\u201cCountries participating in BRI could develop economic dependence on Chinese capital, which China could leverage to achieve its interests,\u201d the report said.\nMalaysia\u2019s new finance minister, Lim Guan Eng, raised the example of Sri Lanka, where a deepwater port built by a Chinese state-owned company failed to attract much business. The indebted South Asian island nation was compelled to hand over to China a 99-year lease on the port and more land near it, giving Beijing an outpost near one of its busiest shipping lanes.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want a situation like Sri Lanka where they couldn\u2019t pay and the Chinese ended up taking over the project,\u201d Mr. Lim said.\nIn a recent interview with The New York Times, Mr. Mahathir made clear what he thought of China\u2019s strategy.\n\u201cThey know that when they lend big sums of money to a poor country, in the end they may have to take the project for themselves,\u201d he said.\n\u201cChina knows very well that it had to deal with unequal treaties in the past imposed upon China by Western powers,\u201d Mr. Mahathir added, referring to the concessions China had to give after its defeat in the opium wars. \u201cSo China should be sympathetic toward us. They know we cannot afford this.\u201d\nMalaysia has long served as a prize of empire, with a geopolitical importance that belies its relatively small size. The Portuguese, Dutch and British flocked here, eager to control a fulcrum linking the Pacific and Indian Oceans. China is the latest power to try to share in the riches.\nKuantan, a Malaysian city nestled on the South China Sea coast, had never been a hot spot. But then China began adding military heft to its territorial aspirations in the sea, where five other governments, Malaysia\u2019s included, have competing claims.\nChinese financing began washing over Kuantan five years ago. Guangxi Beibu Gulf International Port Group, a state-owned firm from an obscure Chinese autonomous region, won a contract supported by the Malaysian government to build a deepwater terminal and industrial park. Nearby was a planned stop on the East Coast Rail Link that would mostly be financed by the Export-Import Bank of China, a government institution.\nPresiding over the official launch for the Malaysia-China Kuantan Industrial Park in 2013, Mr. Najib conferred on the project a global import.\n\u201cChina and Malaysia remain closely connected at a time when the balance of global trade is tilting in Asia\u2019s direction,\u201d he said. \u201cOn economic cooperation \u2014 and diplomatic \u2014 I am proud to say that Malaysia is ahead of the curve.\u201d\nKuantan residents, though, have long worried that the city could be saddled with white-elephant projects.\n\u201cWe welcome foreign investment and development, but we question the huge price that we will have to pay,\u201d said Fuziah Salleh, a Kuantan lawmaker for Malaysia\u2019s new governing coalition. \u201cWho is the real beneficiary of all this financing? The Malaysians or the Chinese?\u201d\n\u201cI am worried that our sovereignty has been sold,\u201d Ms. Fuziah said.\nMr. Mahathir, however, is not averse to standing up to the superpower of the day. He was prime minister before, from 1981 to 2003, and back then he railed against the United States and other Western countries for what he said was a plot to hold back developing nations like Malaysia.\n\u201cMahathir thinks China is a hegemonic force that can control economies like Malaysia,\u201d said Edmund Terence Gomez, a political economist at the University of Malaya. \u201cHe\u2019s always been worried about powerful forces. Before it was the U.S., now it\u2019s China.\u201d\nMr. Mahathir\u2019s administration has been in power for little more than 100 days. In that time, Malaysian officials say, they have discovered that billions of dollars in inflated Chinese contracts were used to relieve debts associated with a Malaysian state investment fund at the heart of a graft scandal that led to Mr. Najib\u2019s downfall.\nThe United States Department of Justice has accused Mr. Najib and his family and friends of plundering billions of dollars from that fund, 1Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB. When the indebted fund began a fire sale of assets, two Chinese state-owned giants, the China General Nuclear Power Corporation and the China Railway Engineering Corporation, moved in, prompting speculation that Beijing was happy to keep Mr. Najib\u2019s cash-strapped government afloat.\nSitting at his desk during an interview after the election, Mr. Mahathir pointed to a sheaf of papers before him. It was a proposal from a Malaysian construction company that he said contained evidence that the East Coast Rail Link could have been developed by a Malaysian company for less than half of the $13.4 billion contract won by the China Communications Construction Company, a state-owned Chinese firm with extensive operations overseas.\nNotably, the bidding process for the rail contract was closed.\nLast week, Mr. Lim, the finance minister, told Parliament that Malaysia would not be able to cover the operational cost for the railway, much less the capital expenditure, which he estimated at nearly $20 billion rather than $13.4 billion.\nNeither the Chinese company nor its Malaysian partner responded to requests for comment.\n\u201cIt looks like not all the money is being used for building the railway line,\u201d Mr. Mahathir said of the East Coast Rail Link deal. \u201cThe likelihood is the money has been stolen.\u201d\nMalaysian investigators are looking into whether an associate of Mr. Najib\u2019s stepson may have brokered the rail deal to alleviate the debt accrued by 1MDB or to fund Mr. Najib\u2019s re-election campaign.\nThe United States Treasury Department considers that associate, Jho Low, an exiled financier who has an arrest warrant out on him, to be the prime agent in the 1MDB scandal. On the eve of Mr. Mahathir\u2019s trip to China, Malaysian finance ministry officials said they believed that Mr. Low had been hiding out in China.\nMalaysia\u2019s new administration, which unseated a coalition that had ruled, in one form or another, since independence in 1957, has also been scrutinizing the $2.5 billion deal for a subsidiary of the China National Petroleum Corporation to build energy pipelines in Malaysia. Mr. Lim said he had discovered upon taking up his post that the Malaysian government had already disbursed more than $2 billion for the project.\nThere was one catch. \u201cFrom what we understand,\u201d Mr. Lim said, \u201czero percent of the construction work has been carried out.\u201d\nWhile the role of Chinese money in bailing out Mr. Najib\u2019s indebted administration has received the most attention, another Chinese megaproject raises even sharper questions about Beijing\u2019s geopolitical aims.\nThe Malaysian city of Malacca was once a conduit for spices and treasures that flowed from Asia to Europe. The strait named after the city is still the channel through which much of Asia\u2019s seaborne trade \u2014 and most of China\u2019s oil imports \u2014 flows.\nBut Malacca\u2019s port silted up centuries ago and is now a backwater. Instead, nearby Singapore, which sits at the southern end of the Strait of Malacca, ranks as the world\u2019s busiest transshipment hub.\nA $10 billion development project \u2014 backed by PowerChina International, a major Chinese utility, and two Chinese port developers \u2014 is supposed to propel Malacca back into global significance, as a vital stop on a maritime trade route that stretches from Shanghai to Rotterdam.\nThe plan for this project, Melaka Gateway, includes three artificial islands and an expanded natural islet, which will hold an industrial park, cruise terminal, theme park, marina, offshore financial hub and self-styled seven-star hotel.\nAnd there will be a new deepwater port, with berths large enough to host an aircraft carrier. The port operator was given a 99-year lease for the deepwater terminal, rather than the more common 30-year time frame.\nThe local partner in Melaka Gateway is KAJ Development, which counts among its previous accomplishments building the local zoo and bird park.\nTo explain how a little-known company was able to work with Chinese firms to transform such a strategic spot, locals have remarked on the close ties between the head of KAJ Development and Mr. Najib\u2019s party machine. The company did not respond to a request for comment.\n\u201cWe have so many questions about the project but no answers,\u201d said Sim Tong Him, a former lawmaker from Malacca. \u201cHow did KAJ get the contract? What might happen if the Malaysian side can\u2019t pay up? The Chinese are so secretive about this. It leaves us with a very bad feeling.\u201d\nMalacca State\u2019s new chief minister has promised an investigation into the feasibility of the entire project, including the possibility that land on one island could be sold as a freehold to a Chinese state-owned company.\nMelaka Gateway\u2019s necessity, at least for locals, has never been clear. After all, the nearby Singaporean port is unlikely to be eclipsed. And Malaysia is already expanding other ports, even as many are running under capacity.\n\u201cWe are very concerned because in the first place we don\u2019t need any extra harbor,\u201d Mr. Mahathir said of the Malacca project.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to depend upon foreigners to come,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen they build, they use foreign labor, foreign materials. What do we get? Nothing.\u201d\nBut Beijing has funded the building of ports across the Indian Ocean, a strategy known as the string of pearls. Military experts have raised the possibility that these ports could one day welcome Chinese warships and submarines.\n\u201cYou look at a map and you can see the places where China is plotting ports and investments, from Myanmar to Pakistan to Sri Lanka, on toward Djibouti,\u201d said Liew Chin Tong, Malaysia\u2019s deputy defense minister. \u201cWhat\u2019s crucial to all that? Our little Malaysia, and the Malacca Strait.\u201d\nUnder Mr. Najib, Malaysia conducted joint military drills with China and allowed Chinese attack submarines to make a port call. Mr. Mahathir has shifted course.\n\u201cI say publicly that we do not want to see warships in the Strait of Malacca or the South China Sea,\u201d he said.\nIn Forest City, a new metropolis being built at the tail end of the Malaysian peninsula, a tour guide gazed up at a bank of screens showcasing the latest in Chinese facial-recognition technology, and gave his best pitch to a group of would-be investors from a coal town in northern China.\nForest City, he said in Mandarin, was a jewel on the South China Sea.\nBest of all, he said, everything in the city was designed for a Chinese clientele, from the layout of the luxury apartments to the signage in Mandarin.\nThe development \u2014 four artificial islands covering around eight square miles, or enough space for around 700,000 people \u2014 was conceived of by Country Garden, one of the largest private Chinese property developers, in cooperation with an investment entity whose largest shareholder is the local sultan.\nIn the sales gallery, an electronic display plays up Forest City\u2019s \u201cstrategic location\u201d and places it at the center of a map of Beijing\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative projects.\n\u201cWe are doing something that will alter the world map,\u201d the sales pitch reads.\nMore than any other project, Forest City helped turn local sentiment against Chinese cash, amid suspicions that a private Chinese property developer was somehow secretly plotting to reshape Malaysia\u2019s delicate ethnic balance.\n\u201cThis is not Chinese investment but a settlement,\u201d Mr. Mahathir said during the election campaign, using Forest City as a frequent punching bag.\nForest City is not a strategic play by the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army to station warships in Malaysia. Nor is it viewed as a way for Beijing to finance the excesses of a corrupt leader. Instead, it represents something even more alarming to the average Malaysian \u2014 four man-made islands on which Chinese can live as they like and, in the process, dilute the Malaysian national identity.\nAlthough the majority of Malaysians are Malay Muslims, the country\u2019s second largest ethnic group is Chinese, followed by an Indian population. Many Chinese migrated to Malaysia during the colonial era, and the feeling that they were given preferential treatment by the British lingers to this day.\nAffirmative action programs that gained full force during Mr. Mahathir\u2019s first stint as prime minister ensure that Malays and indigenous populations get a leg up over ethnic Chinese Malaysians.\nIn that context, the prospect of a new wave of Chinese migration, even if only a population of part-time sunbirds, is politically sensitive in Malaysia.\nBut what if that wave doesn\u2019t even materialize? Capital controls in China have made it far more difficult for Chinese to get their money out to pay for overseas real estate, worrying the Mandarin-speaking sales staff at Forest City. Who will buy all these condominiums, which are priced far above the local property market, if not the Chinese?\n\u201cWe all want Forest City to succeed, because we cannot afford for it to fail and become an empty ghost city,\u201d said Wong Shu Qi, a member of parliament for the Democratic Action Party, which is part of the governing coalition.\n\u201cThe reality is that wishing for a Chinese concession in Malaysia is the best thing we can hope for,\u201d she added. \u201cHow sad is that?\u201d", "date": "Aug. 20, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/20/world/asia/china-malaysia.html", "tags": "pushes \u2018 malaysia china city back \u201d vision mahathir chinese malaysian afford"}
