{"title": "In Poland, an Assault on the Courts Provokes Outrage", "content": "WARSAW \u2014 Step by step, the Polish government has moved against democratic norms: It increased government control over the news media, cracked down on public gatherings and restricted the activities of nongovernmental organizations.\nNow the party in power is moving aggressively to take control of the last major independent government institution, the courts, drawing crowds into the streets and possible condemnation by the European Union.\nThe party is pushing to jam several bills into law; one would force all the nation\u2019s top judges to resign, except those it appointed. Another bill, already approved by Parliament, would ultimately give the government control over who can even be considered for a judgeship.\nIn Brussels on Wednesday, a top European Union official said that if the changes were made, Poland might slip outside the bloc\u2019s definition of a democracy.\n\u201cEach individual law, if adopted, would seriously erode the independence of the Polish judiciary,\u201d said Frans Timmermans, first vice president of the European Commission. \u201cCollectively, they would abolish any remaining judicial independence and put the judiciary under full political control of the government.\u201d\nThe drive to control the courts comes barely two weeks after President Trump paid a triumphant visit to Warsaw and praised the populist and nationalist Law and Justice Party, which controls the government. Now, if the party prevails, its success could be the final chapter in Poland\u2019s long progression from a model Eastern European nation \u2014 and one of the first former Communist nations to join the union \u2014 to what its opponents are calling an illiberal democracy.\nThree former Polish presidents, including Lech Walesa, have released a manifesto against the proposed changes, saying \u201cwe do not consent to taking away our basic civic freedoms.\u201d And a coalition of more than 175 artists and scientists signed an open letter on Wednesday calling the government\u2019s move a \u201ccoup d\u2019\u00e9tat.\u201d\nWith the legacy of the Solidarity movement, Poland entered the post-Soviet era with a head start on other post-Soviet nations politically, and its strong agricultural sector allowed it to quickly emerge as an economic success.\nBut its status as a regional star has been endangered by the rise of the Law and Justice Party. Since assuming power in late 2015, the party has moved to co-opt or weaken potential rivals, beginning with the Constitutional Tribunal, which could have declared its moves unconstitutional. Now dominated by government supporters, the tribunal provides a reliable rubber stamp for government initiatives.\nLaw and Justice supporters have been put in charge of public television and radio, which now adhere to a firmly pro-government line. Independent oversight was removed from the secret services. The justice minister was named chief prosecutor, formerly a separate and more independent post. New regulations were imposed on public assemblies.\nStill, at least one previous step to pull Poland to the right, a nearly total ban on abortions proposed last fall, was defeated after mass protests.\n\u201cThis is a call for a right-wing revolution,\u201d said Jerzy Stepien, the director of the Institute of Civic Space and Public Policy at Lazarski University, and a former president of the Constitutional Tribunal. \u201cIf we have people in power who feel themselves above the law, we are in a revolutionary situation.\u201d\nIn the lower house of Parliament this week, as opposition leaders struggled to beat back the governing party\u2019s push to pass its legislation, people on both sides delivered emotional speeches frequently interrupted by chants.\n\u201cYou could have been reformers of the Polish judiciary,\u201d an enraged Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz, from the opposition Peasants Party, said to stone-faced lawmakers from the Law and Justice Party. \u201cBut you have become its executioners wearing a mask of justice.\u201d\nThings turned especially ugly during a debate at midnight on Tuesday in Parliament when an opposition politician, Borys Budka, presumed to speak for the former Polish president from Law and Justice, who was killed in a 2010 plane crash. \u201cIf Lech Kaczynski were alive, he wouldn\u2019t allow this,\u201d Mr. Budka declared.\nAn enraged Jaroslaw Kaczynski \u2014 the former president\u2019s twin brother and, as leader of Law and Justice, the most powerful political figure in Poland \u2014 seized the lectern and fired back: \u201cDo not wipe your traitorous mugs with the name of my late brother. You are scoundrels.\u201d\nLaw and Justice has long maintained that the 2010 crash was an assassination, perhaps involving Russia and members of the political opposition.\n\u201cYou murdered him,\u201d Mr. Kaczynski shouted.\nEwa Kopacz, the prime minister under the previous center-right government, declared herself flabbergasted. \u201cThis man is crazy with hate,\u201d she said of Mr. Kaczynski. \u201cHe cannot control his emotions.\u201d\nThe conflict over the judiciary has been simmering for some time. One proposed law, already approved by Parliament and awaiting President Andrzej Duda\u2019s signature, would reconfigure the National Council of the Judiciary, which chooses those eligible to become judges, so that government-appointed members would essentially have veto power.\nA second bill, introduced late last week, would force all current members of the Supreme Court to resign, including several who have been feuding with the government, and replace them with judges selected by the governing party\u2019s minister of justice.\n\u201cTheir goal is to create political control over the judiciary,\u201d said Adam Bodnar, Poland\u2019s official ombudsman, who has come out against the bills. \u201cI don\u2019t have doubts about it.\u201d\nMr. Kaczynski and other Law and Justice officials contend that opponents are overreacting to an honest attempt by the government to reform a dysfunctional and highly unpopular court system and to root out corrupt judges and liberal ideologues who want to thwart the will of the people.\nLaw and Justice, Prime Minister Beata Szydlo said, has \u201cstood on the side of the people, and nobody will make us turn back from this way \u2014 not even by shouting here and stamping your feet!\u201d\nTo become law, a bill must have three readings in the Sejm, the lower house of Parliament, then be passed by the Senate and signed by the president. The government\u2019s decision to use procedural maneuvers to fast-track the Supreme Court bill appears to have caught opponents off guard.\n\u201cThere were no public consultations, no public hearings,\u201d said Kamila Gasiuk-Pihowicz of the opposition party Modern. \u201cThere should have been experts\u2019 opinions, but there\u2019s no time for that.\u201d\nPresident Duda tried to suggest a compromise in a nationwide address. He said he would sign the bill on his desk involving the appointment of judges only if an amendment were added so that new judges must get 60 percent of the vote in Parliament rather than a simple majority. Since Law and Justice has only a slim majority in the Sejm, this would force the governing party to find at least one other party to vote with it. If that amendment is not added, Mr. Duda said, he will refuse to sign the Supreme Court law.\nIt was a rare disagreement between Mr. Duda, a former Law and Justice member who became independent when he was elected president, and Mr. Kaczynski. Opponents were not sure whether this signaled a true split between the two leaders or was some sort of a trick.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know if the president is acting really with some sort of noble intentions or whether he\u2019s just playing a game,\u201d said Mr. Stepien, the former president of the Constitutional Tribunal.\nAs opponents sought to slow the bill\u2019s passage, opposition leaders asked Poles to continue to take to the streets. Some protesters have set up a tent camp outside Parliament, vowing to keep a round-the-clock vigil. \u201cI had to be here,\u201d said Lidia Leipert, a lawyer who joined the throng after work.\nAgnieszka Wierzbicka, a nutritionist, said she was already resigned to losing this round.\n\u201cI think our protest is nothing but symbolic now,\u201d she said. \u201cWill it change anything? I highly doubt it. But that doesn\u2019t make it invalid. It is important for history.\u201d", "date": "July 19, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/19/world/europe/poland-courts-law-and-justice-party.html", "tags": "poland outrage provokes party would \u201d justice courts government law assault"}
