{"title": "Parents and Students Plead With Trump: \u2018How Many Children Have to Get Shot?\u2019", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 An anguished father mourning his 18-year-old daughter vented his anger and pleaded for safer schools.\nA fear-stricken student who watched classmates die last week wept openly as he called for banning assault weapons.\nA mother who lost her 6-year-old son in a school shooting just over five years ago warned that more parents would lose their children if President Trump did not act, adding, \u201cDon\u2019t let that happen on your watch.\u201d\nOne by one at the White House on Wednesday afternoon, survivors of school shootings and family members of victims shared their stories and their calls to action. The extraordinary public exchange with the president gave voice to an intensely emotional debate over how to respond to the latest gun massacre in an American school.\nA week after a gunman opened fire with an AR-15-style assault rifle at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., killing 17 people and prompting a rash of student-driven lobbying for new gun restrictions, Mr. Trump met for more than an hour with grieving people in search of solutions. News cameras captured the unusual listening session, revealing an emotional give-and-take between a president and private citizens that is typically shielded from public view.\nMr. Trump used the event to pitch his own ideas about how to prevent such debacles in the future, polling the group about whether they supported allowing teachers and other school employees to carry concealed weapons, an idea he said could have halted the carnage in Parkland.\n\u201cThat coach was very brave, saved a lot of lives, I suspect,\u201d Mr. Trump said, apparently referring to Aaron Feis, a coach at Stoneman Douglas who reportedly died using his body as a shield to protect students. \u201cBut if he had a firearm, he wouldn\u2019t have had to run, he would have shot and that would have been the end of it.\u201d\nMr. Trump said he would press to strengthen background checks for people buying guns and press for enhanced mental health measures. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go very strongly into age \u2014 age of purchase,\u201d he added, appearing to refer to a proposal to set an age threshold for buying certain weapons, including the AR-15.\nBut in a session that began as a subdued conversation and sometimes descended into tears and shouting, policy proposals were overshadowed by raw expressions of fear, anger and sorrow.\n\u201cWe\u2019re here because my daughter has no voice \u2014 she was murdered last week, and she was taken from us, shot nine times,\u201d said Andrew Pollack, whose daughter Meadow was one of the 17 killed in Parkland. \u201cHow many schools, how many children have to get shot? It stops here, with this administration and me, because I\u2019m not going to sleep until it\u2019s fixed.\u201d\nMost of the students and parents invited from the Florida school appeared to support Mr. Trump, many of them prefacing their comments with praise for his leadership. But even fans of the president vented anger and desperation, laying the challenge of responding to the tragedy at his feet.\n\u201cIt should have been one school shooting, and we should have fixed it \u2014 and I\u2019m pissed,\u201d said Mr. Pollack, the only parent of a child killed in Parkland who was at the session, raising his voice as he looked at Mr. Trump. \u201cBecause my daughter, I\u2019m not going to see again.\u201d\nSamuel Zeif, 18, told of texting his parents and brothers from the second floor of Stoneman Douglas, believing that he would be killed, and he dissolved into tears as he begged the president, \u201cLet\u2019s never let this happen again \u2014 please, please.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why I can still go in a store and buy a weapon of war, an A-R,\u201d Mr. Zeif said, referring to the AR-15 rifle. \u201cHow is it that easy to buy this type of weapon? How do we not stop this after Columbine, after Sandy Hook? I\u2019m sitting with a mother who lost her son. It\u2019s still happening.\u201d\nMr. Trump, who has often struggled to express empathy in the face of tragedy, appeared moved by the personal stories, even as he asked repeatedly whether anyone in the ornate room at the White House knew how such horrors could be prevented.\n\u201cI know you\u2019ve been through a lot \u2014 most of you have been through a lot more than you ever thought possible,\u201d Mr. Trump said, seated in a circle with students and parents. \u201cAll I can say is that we\u2019re fighting hard for you, and we will not stop.\u201d\n\u201cI grieve for you,\u201d Mr. Trump added. \u201cTo me, there could be nothing worse than what you\u2019ve gone through.\u201d\nDuring the session, Mr. Trump held a card that appeared to remind him of the basics of compassion when dealing with grieving survivors. \u201cWhat would you most want me to know about your experience?\u201d read one handwritten note on the card, captured in photographs of the event. \u201cI hear you,\u201d read another.\nMr. Pollack said he did not favor adopting new gun restrictions, but pleaded for Democrats and Republicans to come together to create new school safety measures.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about gun laws right now \u2014 that\u2019s another fight, another battle,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need our children safe.\u201d\nYet the subtext of the discussion was a contentious debate over gun restrictions and an all-too-familiar cycle of outrage, activism and promises of action, and then the inevitable inertia of Washington because of the opposition by the National Rifle Association and its allies.\nMr. Trump, a strident defender of gun rights who ran for office with the strong backing of the N.R.A., has come under immense pressure to endorse new gun limits after the Parkland massacre. The mass shooting has prompted a wave of youth activism that has reverberated from South Florida to Washington, where hundreds of students gathered outside the White House gates on Wednesday before the listening session, chanting, \u201cEnough is enough!\u201d and, \u201cHands up! \u2014 Don\u2019t shoot!\u201d\nMark Barden, who lost his 7-year-old son Daniel at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012, said it was futile to believe Congress would act on new policies.\n\u201cWe tried this legislative approach,\u201d said Mr. Barden, a founder and managing director of Sandy Hook Promise, a nonprofit advocacy group created after the massacre. \u201cI\u2019ve been in this building before many times, wringing our hands, pleading with legislators \u2014 \u2018What can we do?\u2019 \u2014 until we finally said we have to go home and do this ourselves.\u201d\nHe and Nicole Hockley, who lost her 6-year-old son Dylan at Sandy Hook, pressed Mr. Trump to consider prevention programs that train schools and educators to identify students in crisis and intervene before they attempt to harm themselves or others.\n\u201cRather than arm them with a firearm,\u201d Ms. Hockley said of teachers, \u201cI would rather arm them with the knowledge of how to prevent these acts from happening in the first place.\u201d\nOne of Mr. Pollack\u2019s sons, Hunter, said he would prefer that educators carried weapons, arguing that more firearms on campus would lead to safer schools.\nYet it was the emotional appeals that appeared to have more influence on Mr. Trump.\nMr. Barden pulled out a photograph of his son showing a gaptoothed grin.\nMr. Pollack spoke movingly of \u201cmy beautiful daughter I\u2019m never going to see again.\u201d\nMs. Hockley implored the president not to allow another massacre of children on his watch, saying: \u201cConsider your own children. You don\u2019t want to be me \u2014 no parent does.\u201d\nAs he ended the session, Mr. Trump promised their stories would not go unheard or unaddressed.\n\u201cThank you for pouring out your hearts,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause the world is watching, and we\u2019re going to come up with a solution.\u201d", "date": "Feb. 21, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/21/us/politics/trump-guns-school-shooting.html", "tags": "\u2018 many shot parents \u201d trump school gun children plead students get \u2014"}
