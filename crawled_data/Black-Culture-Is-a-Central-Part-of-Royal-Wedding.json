{"title": "Black Culture Is a Central Part of Royal Wedding", "content": "Royal watchers wondered how the wedding of the Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, to Harry, the Duke of Sussex, would nod to black identity, and the resounding answer came in the ceremony on Saturday.\nThe duchess is the daughter of an African-American mother and a white father, and her marriage ceremony threaded black culture throughout. \nCentral to the day was a stirring address by The Most Rev. Michael Bruce Curry, the presiding bishop of the American Episcopal Church and its first African-American leader. He quoted the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and touched on themes of universal love. It was delivered in a cadence that is steeped in an African-American religious oratorical tradition that broader America first heard in Dr. King\u2019s speeches.\nIt was followed by Karen Gibson and The Kingdom Choir\u2019s rendition of \u201cStand by Me,\u201d a song first popularized by the soul singer Ben. E. King. It was likely the first gospel performance at a wedding of anyone in the line of succession to the British throne. The sermon and the performance wouldn\u2019t have been out of place at any black church in America. In addition, 19-year-old Sheku Kanneh-Mason, a black Briton, performed a cello solo, in a chapel, where few people of African heritage have performed. \nThe attendees were also a mixed crowd, including luminaries like Oprah Winfrey, Serena Williams and Idris Elba alongside Princess Eugenie of York, Lady Kitty Spencer and, of course, Queen Elizabeth. \nTwitter noticed.
