{"title": "Trump Objects to Mueller Testifying Before Congress", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump reversed himself on Sunday and said that the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, should not testify before Congress, setting up a potentially explosive confrontation with Democrats over presidential authority and the separation of powers.\nThe president argued on Twitter that Mr. Mueller\u2019s report on Russian interference in the 2016 election \u2014 which found no conspiracy between Moscow and Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign but did not exonerate the president on obstruction of justice \u2014 was conclusive and that Congress and the American people did not need to hear from Mr. Mueller. \u201cBob Mueller should not testify,\u201d he said. \u201cNo redos for the Dems!\u201d\nOn Friday, Mr. Trump had said it was up to Attorney General William P. Barr whether Mr. Mueller testified. The president\u2019s about-face now puts new pressure on Mr. Barr, who must decide whether to accede to Mr. Trump\u2019s call. Last week, Mr. Barr said he had no objection to Mr. Mueller testifying.\nThe conflict over Mr. Mueller escalates Mr. Trump\u2019s fight with Democrats just as his re-election campaign is taking shape. It comes on top of numerous refusals by the administration to turn over records to Congress, including a request for Mr. Trump\u2019s tax returns. Mr. Trump has also balked at testimony from his former White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II.\nStill, the confrontation over Mr. Mueller, however much it antagonizes Democrats, could be short-lived. Mr. Mueller, who as special counsel is an employee of the Justice Department, is likely to finish his work this month. After that, any decision to testify before Congress would not be constrained by Mr. Barr, assuming the White House does not try to stop him by some other means, possibly through the courts.\nThroughout the two-year investigation, Mr. Mueller has said virtually nothing in public. Democrats have insisted that Mr. Mueller is the best person to provide a detailed interpretation of the 448-page report that he delivered in March to Mr. Barr, and on Sunday, they vowed to press ahead.\nSenator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, criticized the president, saying he \u201crepeatedly tried to fire Mueller, then he refused to be interviewed by Mueller.\u201d\n\u201cNow he\u2019s trying to silence Mueller,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cMueller must testify publicly before Congress.\u201d\nThe House Judiciary Committee formally invited Mr. Mueller to testify last month and has been negotiating details of a possible appearance on May 15, but no date has been confirmed. Separately, the House Intelligence Committee has also invited Mr. Mueller to answer questions.\nTwo people close to Mr. Trump said he had been moving toward an objection to Mr. Mueller testifying over the last few days as a counter to the call from some Democrats to impeach Mr. Barr for how he handled his own testimony last week to Congress.\nBut some of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers have warned that he risks turning Mr. Mueller into a martyred figure if he demands that he not testify. Others close to the president say he is making a mistake for a different reason in trying to restrain Mr. Mueller.\nThe special counsel, they say, would most likely face tough questions from Republicans about two F.B.I. officials, Lisa Page and Peter Strzok, who in text exchanges were deeply critical of Mr. Trump as they were investigating Russian interference in the election. Those questions would undercut Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation, those close to the president say, and allow them to paint it as a partisan attack on Mr. Trump.\nMr. Barr, during a hearing about the report before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, was pressed on whether Mr. Mueller should be allowed to testify.\n\u201cI\u2019ve already said publicly I have no objection to him testifying,\u201d Mr. Barr responded.\nBy Sunday, the president did have an objection. \u201cAre they looking for a redo because they hated seeing the strong NO COLLUSION conclusion?\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted. \u201cThere was no crime, except on the other side (incredibly not covered in the Report), and NO OBSTRUCTION.\u201d\nDemocrats say it is essential to hear from Mr. Mueller given the friction between the special counsel\u2019s office and Mr. Barr over how the report has been characterized.\nAfter Mr. Mueller delivered his report to Mr. Barr in March, the attorney general issued a four-page summary in which he said there was no finding of collusion between Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia. But he also quoted Mr. Mueller saying he could not exonerate the president on the obstruction issue.\nMr. Mueller then wrote a letter to Mr. Barr complaining that his relatively short rendering of the lengthy report lacked context and full explanation. Last week, Mr. Barr called the letter \u201csnitty\u201d during his Senate testimony.\nMr. Trump and many of his allies have pushed the theme that Mr. Mueller\u2019s report spoke for itself, and that there is no need for additional hearings or testimony. They say Congress should not only move on, but focus its oversight efforts on whether Democrats had even more troubling ties to possible Russian interference.\nSenator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, is among several supporters of the president who have tried to close the book on the Mueller inquiry by saying simply, \u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d\nMr. Graham, however, did open a small window to hear from Mr. Mueller, saying that if the special counsel thought that Mr. Barr had mischaracterized a conversation with him during his congressional testimony, then he would offer the chance for him to clarify the matter before the Senate Judiciary Committee.\nRepresentative Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, sent a letter on April 8 to the committee chairman, Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, asking that Mr. Mueller testify.\n\u201cI write encouraging you to invite Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller, III to testify before our Committee without delay. If you seek both transparency and for the American public to learn the full contours of the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation, public testimony from Special Counsel Mueller himself is undoubtedly the best way to accomplish this goal,\u201d Mr. Collins wrote.\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Collins said on Sunday that he still wanted Mr. Mueller to testify.\nThe effects of the Mueller investigation continued to weigh on the president into Sunday evening.\n\u201cDespite the tremendous success that I have had as President, including perhaps the greatest ECONOMY and most successful first two years of any President in history, they have stollen two years of my (our) Presidency (Collusion Delusion) that we will never be able to get back,\u201d he said in another tweet.", "date": "May 5, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/05/us/politics/trump-mueller-testimony.html", "tags": "president objects counsel \u201d trump barr testifying congress testify mueller"}
