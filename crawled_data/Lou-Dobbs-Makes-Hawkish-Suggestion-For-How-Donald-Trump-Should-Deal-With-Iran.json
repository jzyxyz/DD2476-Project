{"title": "Lou Dobbs Makes Hawkish Suggestion For How Donald Trump Should Deal With Iran", "content": "Lou Dobbs suggested on Tuesday night that President Donald Trump\u2019s administration should raise the stakes with Iran.\nSince becoming president, Trump has pulled the U.S. out of the nuclear deal that the Obama administration negotiated with five other world powers, designated Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization and deployed military forces to the Persian Gulf.\u00a0\nThe Fox Business host, who is a staunch supporter of Trump and recently claimed the commander-in-chief had been sent by God, said Trump was \u201cnot interested\u00a0in a ground war with Iran or anyone else,\u201d but \u201cat the same time would not put up with any more nonsense.\u201d\n\u201cLet me just ask you very quickly, why not make it very clear to the ayatollahs that if you mess further with us, we will not commit troops, but we will reduce your entire infrastructure to dust?\u201d Dobbs asked Christian Whiton, a former adviser in the Trump White House.\n\u201cAnd by that, I mean their entire oil industry upon which they\u2019re utterly dependent?\u201d Dobbs added.\nWhiton agreed with Dobbs\u2019 hawkish suggestion, saying he believed it was \u201cexactly the right thing to do.\u201d\n\u201cI think they should know that, but maybe we could make it clear, especially taking out their oil refining capabilities and also the centrifuges to make uranium and the reprocessing facility to make plutonium,\u201d Whiton said. \u201cTake those out, and we could really have them in a bad position.\u201d\nCheck out the clip, via Media Matters, here:", "date": "\n05/15/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/fox-business-lou-dobbs-iran-dust_n_5cdbbafee4b0c39d2a136c91", "tags": "dobbs hawkish iran administration make makes deal \u201d trump lou donald whiton suggestion"}
