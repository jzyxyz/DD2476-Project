{"title": "Uganda's Bobi Wine: Pop star MP charged with treason", "content": "The Ugandan MP and pop star Bobi Wine has been charged with treason in a civilian court shortly after a military court freed him.\nBobi Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, was immediately re-arrested after being released.\nHis lawyers say he has been assaulted in detention, which the military and President Yoweri Museveni deny.\nHe was detained along with more than 30 others ahead of last week's by-election in the north-western town of Arua.\nThe arrests have raised tension across the country and sparked protests. Police have sealed off the homes of a number of opposition politicians, and high-profile opposition figure Kizza Besigye has been arrested in the capital Kampala.\nThe BBC's Catherine Byaruhanga in Uganda says he was unable to stand by himself and there were moments when he was visibly in pain.\nHis lawyer said he needed \"urgent medical care\", Uganda's New Vision newspaper reported.\nAfter being freed and told that charges of unlawfully possessing firearms were dropped by the General Court Martial in the northern town of Gulu, Bobi Wine was told by his lawyer that he was under arrest again and he was put into a police vehicle with his wife to be taken to the Chief Magistrates Court.\nHe was remanded in custody until 30 August, when he is due back in court.\nThere have been protests against his detention in Uganda and calls by global stars such as Chris Martin, Damon Albarn and Angelique Kidjo for his release.\nOn Tuesday the Ugandan military apologised after soldiers were caught on film beating up a journalist who was covering a demonstration supporting Mr Wine.\nHe was detained in Arua, where President Museveni, who has been in power since 1986, was campaigning.\nThe authorities say opposition lawmakers led supporters to attack the president's convoy with stones. Bobi Wine's driver was later shot dead.\nThe ruling party went on to lose the seat to opposition candidate Kassiano Wadri, who also remains in custody and is facing treason charges.\nThe authorities say weapons and ammunition were found in Bobi Wine's hotel room.\nThe charges are widely viewed as politically motivated and aimed at silencing a prominent critic of the president. The US decried the \"brutal treatment\" of MPs, journalists and others by security forces.\nHe is a successful Afrobeats star, known for a repertoire of catchy tunes that touch on poverty and social justice issues. \nThe lifestyle and love life of the self-styled \"ghetto president\", which refers to his upbringing in the poorest slum of the capital, became tabloid fodder. \nHe shifted gears in 2017, cutting off his dreadlocks and donning sharp suits as he turned his eye to Ugandan politics.\nHe went on to beat more established candidates by a landslide in a by-election and became the MP for Kyadondo East in central Uganda.\nIn a country where more than three-quarters of the population is under the age of 30, Bobi Wine might have demographics on his side. \nHe has been described as a magnetic presence and a skilled orator, who has the potential to galvanise the country's youth.  \nHe told the BBC in 2017 that he wanted to be the voice of the younger generation. \"I'm here to give young people confidence,\" he said.\nHe might also have a knack for being kingmaker. In the past year, four candidates backed by Bobi Wine have won parliamentary seats in by-elections. \nYes. His popularity could make him President Museveni's biggest challenger in the 2021 elections.\nHe protested with activists against a social media tax introduced to boost state revenue, which the government has now said it will review. \nBobi Wine was also one of the leading critics of a push to scrap the constitutional upper age limit, set at 75, for presidential candidates. \nBut the change was signed into law and will allow 74-year-old Mr Museveni to run for a sixth term in 2021.
