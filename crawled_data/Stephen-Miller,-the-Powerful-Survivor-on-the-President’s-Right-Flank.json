{"title": "Stephen Miller, the Powerful Survivor on the President\u2019s Right Flank", "content": "SANTA MONICA, Calif. \u2014 Stephen Miller had their attention. That was reason enough to keep going.\nStanding behind the microphone before a hostile amphitheater crowd, Mr. Miller \u2014 then a 16-year-old candidate for a student government post, now a 32-year-old senior policy adviser to President Trump \u2014 steered quickly into an unlikely campaign plank: ensuring that the janitorial staff was really earning its money.\n\u201cAm I the only one,\u201d he asked, \u201cwho is sick and tired of being told to pick up my trash when we have plenty of janitors who are paid to do it for us?\u201d\nIt appeared he was. Boos consumed the grounds of the left-leaning Santa Monica High School campus. Mr. Miller was forcibly escorted from the lectern, shouting inaudibly as he was tugged away.\nBut offstage, any anger seemed to fade instantly. Students were uncertain whether Mr. Miller had even meant the remarks sincerely. Those who encountered him afterward recalled a tranquillity, and a smile. If he had just lost the election \u2014 and he had, the math soon confirmed \u2014 he did not seem to feel like it.\n\u201cHe just seemed really happy,\u201d said Charles Gould, a classmate and friend at the time, \u201cas if that\u2019s how he planned it.\u201d\nIn the years since, Mr. Miller has rocketed to the upper reaches of White House influence along a distinctly Trumpian arc \u2014 powered by a hyper-fluency in the politics of grievance, a gift for nationalist button-pushing after years on the Republican fringe and a long history of being underestimated by liberal forces who dismissed him as a sideshow since his youth.\nAcross his sun-kissed former home, the so-called People\u2019s Republic of Santa Monica, they have come to regret this initial assessment. To the consternation of many former classmates and a bipartisan coalition of Washington lawmakers, Mr. Miller has become one of the nation\u2019s most powerful shapers of domestic and even foreign policy.\n\u201cThe 31-year-old?\u201d Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, muttered to reporters earlier this year, despairing over who might be making decisions in Mr. Trump\u2019s White House.\nYet on perhaps the president\u2019s signature issue \u2014 immigration policy \u2014 Mr. Miller has emerged in recent days as the driving force behind the administration\u2019s insistence on a wish list of hard-right proposals as part of any deal with Democrats to protect young undocumented immigrants from deportation. White House demands include a crackdown on unaccompanied children at the border, the construction of a border wall with Mexico and legislation to sharply reduce legal immigration.\nAs the surviving watchman on the president\u2019s right flank since the removal in August of Stephen K. Bannon as chief strategist, Mr. Miller also remains a key craftsman in speechwriting at the White House. Mr. Trump, who has long prized Mr. Miller\u2019s fierce loyalty, has embraced his instincts to sharply restrict the number of refugees admitted to the United States next year and to impose new travel restrictions on several predominantly Muslim countries and others deemed to be national security risks.\nFrom the administration\u2019s opening stanzas \u2014 when Mr. Trump let fly his \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d inaugural address \u2014 to his swaggering turn last month before the United Nations, it is Mr. Miller\u2019s worldview, as often as anyone\u2019s, that the president projects on the grandest scale.\n\u201cWe have this running joke,\u201d said Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, \u201cthat if we were going to get key man\u2019s insurance on anyone, Stephen would top the list.\u201d She was referring to policies that companies take out on their most important employee.\nMr. Miller\u2019s journey to this point, outlined over dozens of interviews with friends, classmates and current and former colleagues, is a triumph of unbending convictions and at least occasional contrivance. It is a story of beliefs that congealed early in a home that he helped nudge to the right of its blue-state ZIP code, and of an ideology that became an identity for a spindly agitator at a large and racially divided public high school.\nThese formative years supplied the template for the life Mr. Miller has carved out for himself in Washington, where he remains the hard-line jouster many of Mr. Trump\u2019s most zealous supporters trust most in the White House \u2014 and many former peers fear.\n\u201cI can hear Stephen\u2019s voice,\u201d said a fellow Santa Monica student, Nick Silverman. \u201cEven when Trump reads these statements, I know, \u2018That\u2019s Stephen.\u2019\u201d\nThrough Mr. Miller\u2019s nearly nine months in the Trump White House, the question \u2014 how did he come from here? \u2014 has curdled across these eight square miles of progressive oceanside paradise, where a stroll near the beach can quickly produce images that border on a self-parody of limousine liberalism. Environmentalist stickers festoon a neighborhood pocked with gas guzzlers; a small dog, seated in a stroller, twitches in the sea breeze, rumbling past a homeless man sprawled across a sidewalk bench.\n\u201cIt does have this tang of the seething id of Santa Monica,\u201d another former student, Jake Zambas, said of Mr. Miller\u2019s nativist streak, noting that their high school, like the town, was largely self-segregating. \u201cEveryone here is just a scared white person.\u201d\nIn his time on this campus of roughly 3,000 students, Mr. Miller sculpted the brand of hard-charging conservatism that would deliver him to the president\u2019s ear, tracing a pathway at once complicated and straightforward. Mr. Miller, the middle child in a financially comfortable Jewish family, plainly relished the attention and notoriety of being the city\u2019s red-hued exception, according to classmates \u2014 some of whom recalled chuckling at, or at least shrugging off, the antics of their resident gadfly. The line between puckishness and principle blurred in due time.\nMr. Miller set off on a patriotic semi-striptease before the editor of the student newspaper, according to the editor, Ari Rosmarin, theatrically removing a button-down to reveal an American flag T-shirt in protest of an article he found inconsistent with the national interest. (The White House denied any symbolic unbuttoning, though officials confirmed Mr. Miller\u2019s fondness for the T-shirt.)\nHe jumped, uninvited, into the final stretch of a girls\u2019 track meet, apparently intent on proving his athletic supremacy over the opposite sex. (The White House, reaching for exculpatory context, noted that this was a girls\u2019 team from another school, not his own.)\nMost memorably, classmates say, Mr. Miller established a reputation for barreling eagerly toward racial tinderboxes, leaving some to wonder whether his words were meant to be menacing or hammy. Jason Islas, who had been friendly with Mr. Miller in middle school, has little doubt.\nShortly before the start of ninth grade, Mr. Islas said, he received a call from Mr. Miller informing him that the two could no longer be friends.\n\u201cHe gives me this litany of reasons,\u201d Mr. Islas said.\nMost were petty, if mean, he recalled: an insult about his social awkwardness, a dig at his acne-specked face. But one stuck out.\n\u201cHe mentioned my Latino heritage as one of the reasons,\u201d Mr. Islas said. \u201cI remember coming away from the conversation being like, \u2018O.K., that\u2019s that.\u2019\u201d\nSarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, called Mr. Islas\u2019s account \u201ca completely inaccurate characterization of their relationship, or lack thereof,\u201d disputing his recollection and suggesting the two were more acquaintances than friends. (Mr. Miller declined to be interviewed for this article.)\nSeveral students said Mr. Miller\u2019s trail of racially tinged comments amounted to a pattern. He railed against bilingual announcements, asking in a local editorial why there were \u201cusually very few, if any, Hispanic students in my honors classes, despite the large number of Hispanic students that attend our school.\u201d\nLatino students remembered him engaging them outside group meetings, asking why they required a separate forum to discuss issues of identity, and chafing at Spanish being spoken in the halls.\n\u201cHe tended to make some of the Spanish language stuff very personal,\u201d said Moises Castillo, a classmate who described the exchanges as hurtful to this day. \u201cThere was a \u2018if you\u2019re not speaking English, perhaps you should go somewhere else.\u2019 \u201d\nHe was asked whether Mr. Miller may have been leaning into a sort of provocative shtick, or crafting a character deliberately. In the campaign speech, after all \u2014 a portion of which was captured on video and published by Univision in February \u2014 Mr. Miller often appears to be smirking.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a character?\u201d Mr. Castillo said. \u201cWhen you hear it more than once, when you hear it in private, when you hear it in public, that \u2018character\u2019 kind of fades away. That benefit of the doubt is gone.\u201d\nMr. Miller\u2019s defenders have argued that Mr. Miller\u2019s high school persona \u2014 more merry prankster than fearsome bomb thrower, in their view \u2014 should not diminish the seriousness of his beliefs. Mr. Miller has attributed his conservative awakening, in part, to encountering right-leaning writings on gun policy and other issues, including a 1994 book, \u201cGuns, Crime and Freedom\u201d by Wayne LaPierre, the National Rifle Association leader.\nMr. Miller has said he was also shaped by his school\u2019s response to the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when he confronted what he believed to be excess political correctness and insufficient support for American military efforts. Among his causes: pressing administrators to require the daily recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance. (He prevailed.)\nMr. Miller found mentors in David Horowitz, the onetime \u201cNew Left\u201d Marxist who evolved into a conservative author, and a radio host, Larry Elder, who booked Mr. Miller as a recurring guest. He courted local controversy by inviting both to campus for speeches.\n\u201cHe was already reading Ayn Rand. He was already reading the Federalist Papers,\u201d Mr. Elder said, describing Mr. Miller as effectively a fully formed ideologue by the time he contacted the radio host\u2019s show. \u201cIt\u2019s not an act. He believes what he believes.\u201d\nNews articles have often described Mr. Miller as the product of liberals whose politics changed through sheer force of their son\u2019s arguments. Public documents do support this timeline: Mr. Miller\u2019s parents, Michael and Miriam, changed their registration to Republican from Democrat after Mr. Miller left for college, according to Los Angeles County records.\nBut some who knew the family at the time have challenged the suggestion that he was raised in a classically hard-left Southern California home.\nMiriam Miller\u2019s brother, David Glosser, said the elder Mr. Miller, a real estate investor, had long skewed conservative on some issues, describing him as a \u201cresponsible, thoughtful sort of economic Republican\u201d that Mr. Glosser contrasted with Mr. Trump.\nMessages left for Mr. Miller\u2019s parents were not returned.\nAt Santa Monica Synagogue, the Millers proved an awkward fit in the largely liberal Reform congregation, according to people who knew them then. The younger Mr. Miller \u2014 true to form \u2014 established himself as the perpetually debate-ready boy who most enjoyed taking on all comers in 10th-grade confirmation class. A group photo, with Mr. Miller grinning from the back row in a prayer shawl, still hangs in the hall.\n\u201cWe did our best here,\u201d said Mr. Miller\u2019s rabbi, Jeff Marx, \u201cto teach Jewish ethics and talk about our need to reach out to the strangers, to those less fortunate than we are.\u201d\nBy then, the Miller family had suffered its own notable reversal of fortunes. Earthquake-related property damage had upended Michael Miller\u2019s real estate business, forcing the family to eventually abandon its stately home in the city\u2019s exclusive North of Montana neighborhood.\nSome classmates have speculated that the move, which found the family in a new house a short distance from the grittier and far more ethnically diverse Pico neighborhood, helped shape Mr. Miller\u2019s still-developing views of race and class as he wended through his teens.\nBut others have dismissed this theory, suggesting that the family\u2019s plight should not be overstated. A visit on a recent weekday found a succession of Mercedes-Benzes and Lexuses gliding down the block, with a team of Latino workers tending to landscaping along the sidewalk.\n\u201cThey still moved to a two-story house in Santa Monica,\u201d said Taylor Brinckerhoff, a family friend of the Millers\u2019 who often attended Passover dinners with them.\nFor fellow students, the most credible origin story for Mr. Miller remains the simplest.\nSurely he believed what he was saying, or at least most of it. But he also seemed to grasp quickly that contrarianism could be its own reward in an ecosystem of the like-minded, a way to stand out among the egos and trust funds of a singular American school district.\n\u201cConfrontation was his sort of modus operandi,\u201d said Mr. Rosmarin, the former Santa Monica high school newspaper editor, who now works for the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cI think it\u2019s why he came to school in the morning.\u201d\nAnd there is little doubt that he subscribed early to a future tenet of Breitbart-era conservatism: If you are upsetting liberals, you are probably doing something right.\n\u201cThat was you?\u201d Andrew Breitbart, the founder of the far-right website that bears his name, asked Mr. Miller in 2011, according to three people present for the exchange, during a gathering at the Breitbart townhouse beside the Supreme Court.\nWhen Mr. Miller\u2019s history was mentioned, these people said, Mr. Breitbart instantly recalled the California teenager who had become something of a cult figure in right-wing news media for laying verbal waste to his high school.\nThe megaphones only got louder, a function of timing and gumption.\nAs a student at Duke University, when the school became a national political minefield in 2006 after a black woman accused three white lacrosse players of rape, Mr. Miller sensed an opportunity.\nWhere most students and professors sided quickly with the alleged victim, Mr. Miller became the players\u2019 most vocal defender on cable television, appearing on Fox News to accuse the prosecutor of a witch hunt long before the case collapsed.\n\u201cWe are at a terrible dearth of intelligent, common-sense, courageous voices on campus,\u201d Mr. Miller, then a senior, told Bill O\u2019Reilly on his Fox show, taking something of a victory lap.\nAfter graduating, Mr. Miller moved to Washington to work as press secretary for Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota. By 2009, he found his way to Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama (Mr. Horowitz, the author, had introduced them), and he was eventually elevated to Mr. Sessions\u2019s communications director.\nIn their years together, Mr. Miller positioned himself \u2014 and helped position Mr. Sessions, now the attorney general \u2014 inside the Republican Party\u2019s burgeoning Breitbart wing, seizing on immigration as a central issue while bipartisan immigration legislation slithered through Congress in 2013.\nMr. Miller also found common cause with Mr. Bannon, who hoped to fashion the Breitbart News site into a battlefield for the so-called alt-right, a far-right fringe movement that often embraces an ideology of white nationalism. In 2014, the two helped propel a nearly anonymous House candidate in Virginia, Dave Brat, to a primary election victory over Eric Cantor, the majority leader at the time, in part by hammering Mr. Cantor as overly tolerant of illegal immigration. The race in many ways presaged the campaign of Mr. Trump, whose prospects Mr. Miller soon eyed with excitement.\n\u201cTrump gets it,\u201d Mr. Miller wrote to friends weeks later, forwarding a Breitbart interview with Mr. Trump, who concluded that Mr. Cantor\u2019s defeat owed to \u201chis softness on immigration.\u201d\n\u201cI wish he\u2019d run for president,\u201d Mr. Miller added of Mr. Trump.\nWhen he did, Mr. Miller joined him early, before a vote had been cast in the primaries \u2014 and before Mr. Sessions became Mr. Trump\u2019s most significant elected supporter. At rallies, Mr. Miller often warmed up crowds in his dark suits, his receding hairline slicked back. \u201cWe\u2019re going to build that wall, and we\u2019re going to build it out of love!\u201d Mr. Miller promised.\nMr. Miller quickly grew comfortable with Mr. Trump\u2019s impromptu style during the campaign, on more than one occasion ripping up a completed speech in the back of the candidate\u2019s black S.U.V. because Mr. Trump had a change of heart on the way to an event.\nAnd people close to both men say that more than anyone, Mr. Miller has grasped how to fuse the cadences of Mr. Trump\u2019s own plain-spoken language with something loftier, at times scribbling notes on a piece of paper pressed to the side of a car window as he jotted down the president\u2019s thoughts.\nOccasionally, Mr. Miller has retained a public-facing role. In August, when the administration announced its support for a proposal to slash legal immigration, the White House briefing room belonged to him.\nBy the time the news conference was over, Mr. Miller had sparred with The New York Times, accused a CNN reporter of \u201ccosmopolitan bias\u201d and suggested that the poem associated with the Statue of Liberty (\u201cGive me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses\u201d) should not inform American immigration policy because it was not added to Liberty Island until 17 years after the statue\u2019s unveiling.\nAs he spoke, Ms. Sanders, the press secretary, inched closer, sensing it was time to reclaim the microphone. But Mr. Miller seemed tickled by the combat.\n\u201cI think that went exactly as planned,\u201d Mr. Miller said coyly, finally ceding the stage. \u201cI think that was exactly what we were hoping to have happen.\u201d", "date": "Oct. 9, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/09/us/politics/stephen-miller-trump-white-house.html", "tags": "president right \u201d trump white house miller powerful stephen flank school \u2014 survivor"}
