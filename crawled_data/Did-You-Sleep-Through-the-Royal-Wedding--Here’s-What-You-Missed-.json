{"title": "Did You Sleep Through the Royal Wedding? Here\u2019s What You Missed.", "content": "Good morning. Yes, they\u2019re married. Meghan Markle is now Her Royal Highness, the Duchess of Sussex, and Prince Harry is Harry, Duke of Sussex. \nBut luckily, we got up early (the middle of the night in New York!), chugged coffee, ate sausage rolls (British!) and watched the whole thing, all so we could tell you what you missed.\nOprah Winfrey was there. Serena Williams was there. Amal Clooney was there, in a yellow dress and hat, with her husband, George. Idris Elba was there. David and Victoria Beckham were there, looking uncharacteristically understated. [More about the celebrities.]\nFrom our briefing: Unlike a lot of weddings \u2014 and certainly unlike Kate and William\u2019s wedding, just seven years ago \u2014 the guests inside were hanging out in the aisles, air-kissing and gossiping. [Read the briefing]\nWe\u2019ll get to the newly minted duchess\u2019s dress and accessories in a moment. But first: what was everyone else wearing? \nFrom our briefing: It was an extraordinary mix of tradition and modernity, of centuries of history and up-to-the moment flourishes. \nThe entire royal family was here, along with a complement of English aristocrats and important personages. The music was stately and beautiful. The setting was awe-inspiring.\nThere was a flotilla of clergymen, an extraordinary m\u00e9lange including the archbishop of Canterbury and \u2014 in a striking inclusion in this most ancient of places \u2014 the first African-American leader of the Episcopal Church, the Most Rev. Michael Curry.\nChosen to give the address to the congregations, Bishop Curry quoted Martin Luther King. His voice rising and falling with emotion, he made a big, generous, impassioned case for love as the most important thing there is, in religion and in life. [Read more about the Most Reverend Curry and read the full transcript.]\nHis address came after a reading by Lady Jane Fellowes, Harry\u2019s aunt (her sister was Diana, Princess of Wales) that was both full of joy and a signal, it seemed, that the sadness in Harry\u2019s life since his mother\u2019s death has finally lifted.\nIt was a passage from the Song of Solomon: \u201cArise my love, my fair one, and come away; for now the winter is past, the rain is over and gone.\u201d [Read the full wedding program]\nFrom our fashion critic\u2019s review:\nIt was haute couture by Clare Waight Keller for Givenchy, a British woman who was the first female designer of the storied French brand. And it was everything people had hoped.\nIt was not a Cinderella choice, not one that spoke of fantasy or old-fashioned fairy tales, but one that placed the woman proudly front and center. It underscored Ms. Markle\u2019s own independence by divesting her of frippery, while also respecting tradition and keeping her covered up. \nAnd the most surprising thing of all was that in this age of rampant leaks and gossip, Ms. Markle had managed to keep all of this completely secret. In all the rumors that had swirled around The Dress \u2014 from Ralph & Russo to Stella McCartney  \u2014 Ms. Waight Keller\u2019s name had never even once come up.  [Here\u2019s the full review]\nThe bride and groom looked calm and contented throughout the ceremony, though there were occasional tears.\nIf a royal wedding can be said to be approachable, this one was. If you ignored the pomp and finery, their royal highnesses almost looked like any other young couple in love. \nFrom our briefing: They both looked so happy, and so relaxed. They were beaming as they said their vows, and luckily, no one came forward to provide any reason that they might not be married. (This is always an exciting moment in a ceremony.)", "date": "May 19, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/19/style/what-happened-royal-wedding.html", "tags": "briefing wedding full dress markle read thing royal one sleep missed \u2014 harry"}
