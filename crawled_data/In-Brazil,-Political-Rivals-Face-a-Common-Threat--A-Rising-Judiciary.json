{"title": "In Brazil, Political Rivals Face a Common Threat: A Rising Judiciary", "content": "RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 It was anything but a surrender.\nAt times jovial and defiant, the former president of Brazil, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, stood before a crowd of cheering supporters, painting himself as the victim of a deceitful judiciary that had wandered dangerously into politics.\n\u201cIf they think that with this sentence they will take me out of the game, let them know that I\u2019m in the game,\u201d Mr. da Silva said on Thursday, a day after his conviction on corruption and money laundering charges threatened his bid for a third presidency.\nCorruption investigations have discredited virtually every powerful political force in Brazil, upending the country before presidential elections next year.\nNow political adversaries on very different sides of the ideological spectrum are relying on the same survival strategy: attacking the legitimacy of prosecutors and judges who have set out to dismantle the culture of corruption that Brazilian politicians have institutionalized over decades.\nThe ruling against Mr. da Silva, one of Latin America\u2019s most lionized and influential politicians, is the biggest conviction in a battle between the political class and a corps of judges and prosecutors \u2014 many of them in their 20s, 30s and 40s \u2014 who have dashed the impunity that elected officials have enjoyed for years.\nOn one side of the fight are veteran politicians like Mr. da Silva and the current president, Michel Temer, who faces the possibility of being ousted from office and sent to prison on corruption charges.\nThe two men, both in their 70s, are bitter political rivals who spent decades rising and falling in the highly fractured Brazilian party system, where fickle alliances are often sealed in back-room dealings and secret payoffs.\nStanding against them are prosecutors and judges who argue that they are championing a more responsive vision of government. Preaching transparency, they are active on social media, openly encouraging Brazilians to make a united stand against graft.\n\u201cThe faith in the political class is weakening, and this brings about a sense of confidence in the judiciary,\u201d said Alan Mansur, the head of Brazil\u2019s National Association of Prosecutors.\nDozens of lawmakers have been indicted or investigated in the past few years, for a range of crimes that include accepting unlawful campaign funds, soliciting bribes and laundering money.\nAnd public opinion polls have shown that an overwhelming majority of Brazilians support the investigations rattling the political class. An Ipsos poll released in January found that 96 percent of respondents supported allowing the sweeping investigations that have caught up many political figures to continue \u201cto the end, regardless of the outcome.\u201d\nSergio Moro, 44, the judge who convicted Mr. da Silva, has become the most prominent figure in the crusade against corruption. Saying that he took no pleasure in sentencing a former president to almost 10 years in prison, Judge Moro invoked a saying by the 17th-century English historian Thomas Fuller to underscore the ruling: \u201cBe you never so high the law is above you,\u201d he wrote.\nAs the corruption cases overseen by Judge Moro have ensnarled an ever-growing class of powerful Brazilians, the judge has become something of a folk hero in the country. And in legal circles abroad, he is sometimes hailed as a transformational force for Brazil.\nBut Mr. da Silva, who helped lift millions out of poverty as president from 2003 to 2010 and still commands the loyalty of many Brazilians, argues that judges and prosecutors are pursuing him in court because they do not have the support to beat him at the ballot box.\nOn Thursday, in remarks at his party headquarters in S\u00e3o Paulo that often felt like a campaign rally, Mr. da Silva painted himself as the victim of a politically motivated judiciary that would fail in its efforts to derail his bid for the presidency.\nHe joked one moment, bragging that he had not even bothered to read the 218-page verdict that condemned him to nearly a decade in prison because he had been busy watching his favorite soccer team.\nThen, in an attack on the integrity of the justice system, he invoked his poor upbringing and his mother\u2019s legacy. \u201cI learned about honesty from an illiterate woman,\u201d Mr. da Silva said, his eyes welling up.\nThe theme of unfair judicial interference has given staunch political rivals common ground.\nAfter Mr. da Silva\u2019s conviction, Mr. Temer\u2019s lawyer, Antonio Cl\u00e1udio Mariz de Oliveira, told reporters that the two veteran politicians were being targeted by prosecutors who were accusing \u201cinnocent people\u201d and \u201cdestroying reputations\u201d with \u201chasty allegations.\u201d\nProsecutors and judges reject the claims that they are acting as political kingmakers, not unbiased defenders of the law.\n\u201cDefendants are being prosecuted in almost every political party,\u201d said Mr. Mansur, the head of the prosecutors association. \u201cThis shows that it is not about a preference for a political party or the persecution of a political party.\u201d\nState prosecutors charged Mr. da Silva with money laundering and corruption, accusing him of accepting costly upgrades to a beachfront apartment from a construction company. In exchange, prosecutors said, the company received lucrative contracts from the state-owned oil company, Petrobras.\nMr. Temer was charged last month by federal prosecutors who accuse him of condoning bribes to a jailed politician in order to obstruct a corruption investigation. Both cases stem from a sweeping investigation into corruption involving Petrobras.\nTransparency International, an anti-corruption watchdog, applauded the conviction against Mr. da Silva. Bruno Brand\u00e3o, the head of the organization\u2019s office in Brazil, called the verdict a transformational moment for the country.\n\u201cThe centuries-old impunity of the elite classes in Brazil is being dismantled,\u201d he said.\nMr. da Silva\u2019s fate is now in the hands of a panel of three judges in the southern city of Porto Alegre. On Thursday, the head of that appeals court said he expected that the court would decide the case before Aug. 15, 2018, the deadline to register as a presidential candidate.\nIf the court upholds the verdict, Mr. da Silva, one of the founders of the leftist Workers\u2019 Party, could spend nearly 10 years in prison. If the conviction is overturned, the canny politician could return to power and lead Brazil once more.\nMr. Brand\u00e3o said that the appeals court in Porto Alegre was well regarded in legal circles and that it tended to uphold Judge Moro\u2019s decisions more often than it has overturned them.\n\u201cIn general, it is a court that is very well prepared,\u201d Mr. Brand\u00e3o said. \u201cThe judges are very discreet. They don\u2019t appear in the media, and virtually no one in the Brazilian population knows these judges by name. The more anonymous the judges, the better it is for justice.\u201d\nSome politicians welcome the shake-up \u2014 and stand to benefit from it.\nMarina Silva, a former member of Mr. da Silva\u2019s cabinet who broke ranks with his Workers\u2019 Party in 2009, said the scandals plaguing Brazil\u2019s dominant political parties could be a catalyst for a sweeping transformation that the country needs.\n\u201cBrazil\u2019s current crisis requires the reinvention of politics,\u201d said Ms. Silva, who ran for president in 2014 and is widely expected to enter the race next year. \u201cThis debate is not limited to Brazil, but extends to the world.\u201d", "date": "July 13, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/13/world/americas/brazil-luiz-inacio-lula-da-silva-michel-temer-corruption-presidency.html", "tags": "prosecutors face da judiciary corruption political \u201d silva brazil threat common rising rivals"}
