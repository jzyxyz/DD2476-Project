{"title": "Cohen Pleads Guilty and Details Trump\u2019s Involvement in Moscow Tower Project", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Donald J. Trump was more involved in discussions over a potential Russian business deal during the presidential campaign than previously known, his former lawyer Michael D. Cohen said Thursday in pleading guilty to lying to Congress. Mr. Trump\u2019s associates pursued the project as the Kremlin was escalating its election sabotage effort meant to help him win the presidency.\nMr. Trump\u2019s participation in discussions about building a grand skyscraper in Moscow showed how the interests of his business empire were enmeshed with his political ambitions as he was closing in on the Republican nomination for president. During the early months of 2016, when the business discussions were taking place, he was publicly pressing for warmer relations between the United States and Russia and an end to economic sanctions imposed by the Obama administration, policy positions that might have benefited his family business.\nCourt documents made public by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, detailed new accusations against Mr. Cohen, the president\u2019s former fixer, who already pleaded guilty this year to committing campaign finance violations and financial crimes. Mr. Cohen was the point person at the Trump Organization for negotiating a deal for the Moscow project, and on Thursday he admitted lying to congressional investigators about the duration of the negotiations and the extent of the involvement of Mr. Trump \u2014 who is identified in the court documents as \u201cIndividual 1.\u201d\nAfter pleading guilty in a Manhattan courtroom on Thursday morning, Mr. Cohen said that he made the false statements to Congress out of loyalty to the president and to align with Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cpolitical messaging.\u201d\nMr. Cohen\u2019s cooperation with the special counsel\u2019s investigation raises the possibility that he might have information about the central focus of the inquiry: whether President Trump or any of his associates conspired with Russia\u2019s efforts to disrupt the 2016 election. And it was the second time that Mr. Cohen has imperiled the presidency; he said in court in New York in August that Mr. Trump directed hush money payments during the 2016 campaign to conceal potential sex scandals.\nThe Trump Tower discussions were occurring as Russia ramped up its sabotage campaign, the information provided on Thursday by Mr. Cohen showed, though the documents do not say whether any of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers were aware of the Russian disruption effort. According to a grand jury indictment made public this year, Russian intelligence operatives hacked the emails of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman in March 2016. That same month, an obscure professor whom Mr. Mueller\u2019s team has identified as a likely cutout for Russian intelligence began courting a Trump campaign aide, George Papadopoulos.\nMr. Cohen admitted that the discussions about Trump Tower Moscow went on for at least six months after he had told Congress they had ended. They lasted until at least June 14, 2016, when Mr. Cohen met in New York with an associate who had been trying to arrange his trip to Russia, and told him he would not be traveling \u201cat that time,\u201d court documents said. Mr. Cohen also discussed the deal in a 20-minute phone call with a Russian government employee.\nThat same day, The Washington Post reported that Russian operatives had infiltrated the computer network of the Democratic National Committee \u2014 the first public evidence of Moscow\u2019s campaign to disrupt the election.\nMr. Cohen said on Thursday that he discussed the status of the project with Mr. Trump on more than the three occasions he had previously acknowledged and briefed Mr. Trump\u2019s family members about it.\nSome of those exchanges, which continued until January 2016, included the president\u2019s children Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr., both of whom are executives at the Trump Organization, according to three people familiar with the documents that the company turned over to Mr. Mueller\u2019s team.\nIn one email exchange in 2015, Ms. Trump made a suggestion about the architecture, according to two of the people familiar with the messages.\nDonald Trump Jr. appeared to have replied to only one message, saying \u201cCool\u201d in response to an update about the project, the people said.\nMr. Trump and Mr. Cohen discussed Mr. Trump himself traveling to Russia after the Republican National Convention, though that trip never materialized.\nMr. Trump defended his role in the Trump Tower Moscow discussions, brushing aside concerns that he was advancing his business interests at the time he was hoping to become president.\n\u201cThere was a good chance that I wouldn\u2019t have won, in which case I would have gotten back into the business, and why should I lose lots of opportunities?\u201d he said to reporters as he left Washington for the Group of 20 meeting in Buenos Aires.\n\u201cWe decided \u2014 I decided ultimately \u2014 not to do it,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThere would have been nothing wrong if I did do it.\u201d\nMr. Trump accused his former fixer of lying to receive a reduced sentence for the crimes he has pleaded guilty to. Under his earlier plea agreement, Mr. Cohen faced about four to five years in prison.\n\u201cHe was convicted of various things unrelated to us,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding, \u201cHe\u2019s a weak person and what he\u2019s trying to do is get a reduced sentence.\u201d\nThe proceedings in Lower Manhattan appeared to have global repercussions. After Mr. Cohen\u2019s appearance in court, Mr. Trump abruptly canceled a planned meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia while both leaders are in Argentina. The president said he called off the meeting because of Russia\u2019s recent hostilities with Ukraine.\n[Read about Trump associates\u2019 connections with Russia and Ukraine.]\nThe new revelations were certain to increase the strain between Mr. Trump and the Justice Department. In recent days, the president and his lawyers have increased their attacks on the department and the Russia investigation, including Mr. Mueller. This week, the special counsel\u2019s office accused Mr. Trump\u2019s onetime campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, of repeatedly lying to investigators in breach of his plea agreement.\nThe acting attorney general, Matthew G. Whitaker, was told of Mr. Cohen\u2019s impending plea Monday or earlier, a person familiar with the special counsel\u2019s investigation said. The White House learned of it late Wednesday, people close to Mr. Trump said.\nThe new revelations also came a week after Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers provided Mr. Mueller with written responses to a set of questions.\nThe special counsel identified Mr. Cohen\u2019s false statements to Congress in testimony and materials that Mr. Cohen provided to the Senate and House Intelligence Committees, which have been conducting their own investigations into possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a reason people shouldn\u2019t lie when they\u2019re in front of a congressional investigation,\u201d Senator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, said on Thursday. The committee\u2019s top Democrat, Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, said that the panel had made additional criminal referrals to Mr. Mueller, but he gave no specifics.\nMr. Trump said on Thursday that discussions about the Moscow project took place in early 2016, but that he did not know exactly when he decided to stop pursuing it.\n[Read about Mr. Trump\u2019s attempts to chase business deals in Russia.]\nThe president has previously said that there would be no problem if he continued to run his business from the White House. \u201cI have a no-conflict-of-interest provision as president,\u201d Mr. Trump said in January 2017, adding, \u201cI have no deals that could happen in Russia, because we\u2019ve stayed away.\u201d\nMr. Cohen\u2019s new guilty plea in Federal District Court is the first time the office of the special counsel has charged him. In exchange for pleading guilty and continuing to cooperate with Mr. Mueller, he may hope to receive a lighter sentence.\nHe is scheduled to be sentenced in two weeks. It is unclear what additional time he could face with the new guilty plea.\nDuring his plea hearing in August, Mr. Cohen admitted to making a $130,000 payment to an adult film actress, Stephanie Clifford, better known as Stormy Daniels, to keep her quiet about an affair she said she had with Mr. Trump.\nThe payment amounted to an illegal contribution to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, prosecutors argued, since her silence bolstered his election hopes and campaign finance law prohibits individuals from donating more than $2,700 to a presidential candidate.\nHe said that the payments to Ms. Clifford and Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, were made \u201cin coordination with, and at the direction of, a candidate for federal office\u201d \u2014 a reference to Mr. Trump.\nRepresentative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Mr. Cohen\u2019s plea on Thursday only added urgency for congressional investigators who plan to begin an inquiry into Mr. Trump\u2019s foreign business dealings when Democrats take control of the House in January.\n\u201cIf the president and his associates were being untruthful in real time as they were pursuing this deal,\u201d Mr. Schiff told reporters on Thursday, \u201cwhat does it mean now on how much we can rely on what the president is saying about any continuing Russian financial interest?\u201d", "date": "Nov. 29, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/nyregion/michael-cohen-trump-russia-mueller.html", "tags": "guilty project \u201c details pleads business president trump cohen moscow involvement russia campaign tower"}
