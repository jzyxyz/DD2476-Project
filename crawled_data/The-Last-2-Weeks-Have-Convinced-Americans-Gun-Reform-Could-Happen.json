{"title": "The Last 2 Weeks Have Convinced Americans Gun Reform Could Happen", "content": "Polling in the aftermath of a mass shooting in the U.S. usually follows a well-worn pattern. The first surveys, conducted with the tragedy still flashing across TV screens, show a brief uptick in concern about gun violence, and maybe a spike in the national appetite for tighter firearm restrictions. Then, as soon as the story fades from the headlines, the increase is gone. \nThis time looks different.\nA HuffPost/YouGov survey taken immediately after the Feb. 14 school shooting in Parkland, Florida, found the same familiar uptick. But in the days since, the numbers have continued to shift in favor of congressional action on guns. There\u2019s also a rising belief that Congress could actually take such action.\nThe deaths of 17 students and staff members Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School \u2015 and the surge of activism that\u2019s followed, led by surviving classmates \u2015 have, the polling suggests, moved the national debate in a way that last year\u2019s shootings at a Las Vegas concert and a Texas church did not.\nAmericans now say by a nearly a two-to-one margin, 50 percent to 26 percent, that it\u2019s politically possible to pass stricter gun laws \u2015 a high in polling since 2015, and a remarkable swing from less than two weeks ago, when just 38 percent saw it as feasible. \nThe shift spans political lines and includes both those who favor such a change and those who don\u2019t. The share of Hillary Clinton voters believing new laws can be passed rose by 13 percentage points, while the share of Donald Trump voters rose 17 points. \nActive support for making gun laws stricter has increased more modestly in the HuffPost/YouGov poll: It currently stands at 58 percent, up from the 48-to-54-percent range it occupied from last year. \nBut other questions show more substantial movement in a willingness to accept new restrictions, and in a sense that they\u2019re legislatively achievable.\n Sixty percent of Americans now say that mass shootings are something that can be stopped, rather than a fact of life in the country \u2015 up 18 points from as recently as last October. A 51 percent majority say Congress should take action to reduce mass shootings, up 10 points since last year.\nAnd 65 percent, including a majority in both parties, now say that it\u2019s possible to enact some kinds of new gun regulations while still maintaining Americans\u2019 right to bear arms. Immediately after last year\u2019s Las Vegas shootings, just 53 percent said so.\nMuch of the change on this question appears due to a shift of opinion on the right. A majority of Trump voters, 52 percent, now say gun laws could be tightened without violating the Second Amendment, up from 43 percent immediately after the Parkland shooting and just 33 percent after last year\u2019s Las Vegas shooting. Among Republicans, the number is currently 61 percent, up from 42 percent last fall. \nThe change in opinion on guns should come with a sizable helping of caveats. Public support for gun control \u2015 and especially for specific measures like background checks, which enjoy near-universal support \u2015 has long outpaced the implementation of actual policy on the issue, in part because opponents of gun restrictions have been more likely to make their views heard to officials.\nAnd though the 21 percent who count gun issues among their top priorities in the HuffPost/YouGov poll is notably higher than it was last year, the topic still ranks behind issues like health care and the economy. It\u2019s also unclear whether the momentum behind this push for gun control will last the months until the midterm elections.\nAt this moment, however, the political landscape looks more promising for gun control advocates than it has in some time.\nUse the widget below to further explore the results of the HuffPost/YouGov survey, using the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups:\nThe HuffPost/YouGov poll is among a slew of recent surveys finding a substantial shift on gun control. A roundup of the latest from other outlets:\nCNN: \u201cSupport for stricter gun laws has spiked to the highest level since 1993, and almost two-thirds say government and society can take action to prevent future mass shootings, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS. The findings suggest the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, has shifted public opinion on gun laws in a way other recent mass shootings have not.\u201d\nPolitico: \u201cSupport for stricter gun laws has spiked in polls conducted after the fatal South Florida school shooting, hitting its highest level in at least a quarter-century. Roughly 2 in 3 Americans now say gun control laws should be made more strict in the wake of the murder of 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, according to a number of polls, including a new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll that shows support for stricter gun laws among registered voters at 68 percent, compared with just 25 percent who oppose stricter gun laws.\u201d\nQuinnipiac: \u201cAmerican voters support stricter gun laws 66-31 percent, the highest level of support ever measured by the independent Quinnipiac University National Poll, with 50-44 percent support among gun owners and 62- 35 percent support from white voters with no college degree and 58-38 percent support among white men.\u201d\nYouGov: \u201cA majority of the public consistently has supported many gun control proposals: just over half in last week\u2019s Economist/YouGov Polls say they want stricter gun laws in general. But support has not grown beyond that \u2015 until now. ... The movement towards supporting stricter gun laws has taken place across the political spectrum.\u201d\nMarist: \u201cFollowing the tragic shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, 71% of Americans, including 58% of gun owners, agree the laws governing the sale of firearms need to be stricter. This is up from 64% in October 2017. ... Of note, 77% of Americans who say a candidate\u2019s position on gun policy will have a major influence on their vote in this year\u2019s midterm elections assert gun laws need to be strengthened.\u201d\nUSA Today: \u201cAmericans overwhelmingly support tougher gun laws, a new USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll finds, but they also overwhelmingly agree on this: Congress isn\u2019t likely to act anytime soon.\u201d\nCBS: \u201cSixty-five percent of Americans now say laws covering the sale of guns should be stricter \u2015 an eight-point increase from December. It is the highest number recorded in this poll for stricter gun sale laws. The rise has been primarily among Republicans and independents, with a large increase among Republicans from last December. Democrats remain in favor.\u201d\nThe HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Feb. 26-28 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov\u2019s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.\nHuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

More details on the polls\u2019 methodology are available here.\nMost surveys report a margin of error that represents some, but not all, potential survey errors. YouGov\u2019s reports include a model-based margin of error, which rests on a specific set of statistical assumptions about the selected sample rather than the standard methodology for random probability sampling. If these assumptions are wrong, the model-based margin of error may also be inaccurate.
