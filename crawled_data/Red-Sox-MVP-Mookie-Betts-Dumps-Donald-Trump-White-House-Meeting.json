Betts, 26, simply said: \u201cI won\u2019t be going there.\u00a0I decided not to.\u201d\nHe made the announcement Saturday in New York at the awards dinner of the Baseball Writers\u2019 Association of America, where he accepted his first MVP honor, The Boston Globe reported.\nOther team members are considering what to do about the White House meeting scheduled for May, the Globe said.\nThird baseman Rafael Devers has already said he\u2019s not attending simply because he \u201cwasn\u2019t compelled to go,\u201d and that his decision is not related to politics.\u00a0\nBetts\u2019 snub comes just days after after California\u2019s\u00a0Golden State Warriors\u00a0basketball team skipped a White House visit for the second successive year. The Warriors did travel to Washington \u2014 but met instead with Barack Obama.\nLast year, Trump\u00a0preemptively disinvited the NBA champions because he knew players planned to turn down his invitation. The year before he also yanked an invitation.\u00a0\n\u201cGoing to the White House is considered a great honor for a championship team,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cStephen Curry is hesitating, therefore invitation is withdrawn!\u201d\nCurry said before his invitation was pulled that he and his teammates \u201cdon\u2019t stand for .\u2009.\u2009. the things that he said and the things that he hasn\u2019t said in the right terms.\u201d\nRed Sox manager Alex Cora, a Puerto Rican native, is \u201cunlikely\u201d to attend the White House meeting, The Washington Post reported.\nCora has criticized Trump for deriding an increase in the Puerto Rican government\u2019s official death toll from Hurricane Maria to nearly 3,000.\n\u201cTo be tweeting about 3,000 people and be efficient, it\u2019s actually disrespectful for my country,\u201d Cora\u00a0said\u00a0then. \u201cHe went down there, he did what he did. I hate talking about politics and all that, but I think this is more than politics.\u201d\nCora added: \u201cI respect him. He\u2019s the president of the United States. But I don\u2019t agree with a lot of stuff that he says about us.\u201d\u00a0\nCora led a relief effort operation to Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria.\nHe\u2019s the only American League player to win the MVP, a Gold Glove, a Silver Slugger \u2014 and a World Series \u2014 in the same season. After Game 2 in the series last October, Betts took the time to provide hot meals to Boston\u2019s homeless.\u00a0", "date": "\n01/28/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/red-sox-mookie-betts-dumps-trump-white-house-meeting_n_5c4e923fe4b06ba6d3be8860", "tags": "invitation cora dumps red white trump house meeting donald \u201d boston betts mvp sox mookie"}
