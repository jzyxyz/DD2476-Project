{"title": "Unsolved 'Game of Thrones' Mysteries, Solved By The Night King Himself", "content": "In Season 8, Episode 3, \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d became a song of ice chips and fire.\u00a0\nWarning: Spoilers ahead!\nWhen all hope seemed to be lost as the Night King (Vladim\u00edr Furd\u00edk) comes face-to-face with Bran (Isaac Hempstead Wright), Arya (Maisie Williams) leaps out of the darkness to stab the blue-eyed villain with her Valyrian steel dagger. The Night King shatters, along with all hope of learning more about the White Walkers\u2019 motivations and their mysterious past.\nDuring a phone call with HuffPost, the Night King himself, Furd\u00edk, joked that having his death finally out in the open was \u201clike somebody releasing me from the jail.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m free,\u201d he said, \u201cso if somebody asks me something, I can answer them.\u201d\nSo we did ask the Slovak actor and stuntman. Though the Night King is now gone from the show \u2015 and Furd\u00edk himself isn\u2019t clued in to all the secrets \u2015 he shed some light on the mysteries that remain.\nHow did the Night King survive the dragon fire?\nHe\u2019s resistant \u2026 on the day when we shot, everything was CGI. There was one big fire around me. I was in the middle of the fire, and the rest of the fire was CGI. And then he survived because he can\u2019t die this way.\nOn the show, the Night King has multiple moments where he stares down Jon Snow (Kit Harington). What do you think the meaning of that is?\nIt\u2019s interesting. I\u2019m thinking about this as well. I think there should be something in the history between them. Maybe they are the same blood, and they don\u2019t know it. Maybe Jon Snow doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s kind of like the great-great-great-grandfather or something.\nSure. There are people who think the Night King is a Targaryen like Jon.\nYeah. He just thinks, the Night King thinks, \u201cHey, just let me go. What do you want from me? Just let me alone.\u201d I feel like on the set just, \u201cHey, boy, young boy, stay. Stop. Stop. Stop. Don\u2019t follow me.\u201d\nIn the show, the Night King turns babies into White Walkers by touching them. Why do you think Arya doesn\u2019t turn into a White Walker when he touches her?\nBecause he doesn\u2019t touch her in the right place. Yeah, he doesn\u2019t have time to touch her in the right place because he holds her throat, and then holds her arm. He doesn\u2019t have time to put the fingers on exactly the place where they should be. Also because she\u2019s more than a teenager. She\u2019s already a woman. She wasn\u2019t a baby.\nFor a while, people have theorized that the Night King and Bran are the same person. Now that the Night King is dead, can we finally put this theory to rest?\nI don\u2019t think they are the same, and the history should be something stronger, a stronger story than \u201cthey are the same.\u201d There should be a stronger story.\u00a0\nAs the Night King, is it difficult to take bathroom breaks?\nIt was difficult, really, because I had also long nails on my fingers, and it\u2019s not easy to put the trousers down with the long nails. [Laughs] Open the zips and everything. It was really difficult. I spent sometimes 50 minutes.\nSpeaking of the long nails, some wanted to know how the Night King managed to have such well-manicured nails.\u00a0\nI don\u2019t know. I think he doesn\u2019t care about the long nails.\nEditor\u2019s note: Mara Mikialian, HBO\u2019s Senior Vice President of Media Relations, also pointed us to this behind-the-scenes video where you can see that the Night King\u2019s hands are prosthetic. \u201cThey get to be kept beautiful all the time,\u201d she said. \u201cExactly,\u201d added Furd\u00edk.", "date": "\n05/04/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/night-king-game-of-thrones_n_5ccc63bae4b0548b735970cd", "tags": "solved think fire something unsolved furd\u00edk nails \u201d night mysteries king thrones like"}
