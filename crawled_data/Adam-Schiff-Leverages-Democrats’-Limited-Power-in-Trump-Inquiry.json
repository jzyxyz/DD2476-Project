{"title": "Adam Schiff Leverages Democrats\u2019 Limited Power in Trump Inquiry", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 As attack dogs go, Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, is more labradoodle than Doberman, his partisanship disguised by a thick fur of intense preparation, modulated locution and gentle accusations.\nSo in a hearing on Monday of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence about Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, Mr. Schiff, a doe-eyed former federal prosecutor, politely probed James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, and carefully laid out the history of the Trump campaign\u2019s contacts with Russian officials. It was a performance that showed how an avalanche of information can leverage the limited power of the minority party to damage a president.\n\u201cHis public style of questioning is very similar to his nonpublic style of interacting with colleagues,\u201d said Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina and another former prosecutor who as chairman of the committee investigating the attacks in Benghazi, Libya, was known for his pointed, even excitable style. \u201cThe courtroom is different from a committee hearing room in almost every way, but Adam has managed to make the transition well.\u201d\nIn the hearing, Mr. Schiff successfully pressed Mr. Comey to say that the F.B.I. had no evidence to support President Trump\u2019s claim that his predecessor, President Barack Obama, had tapped his phones in Trump Tower. Soon afterward, Mr. Comey confirmed what had been widely reported before Monday: The F.B.I. is investigating whether members of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign colluded with Russia to influence the election, an admission that took Mr. Schiff by surprise, he said.\nIt is a technique Mr. Schiff has employed repeatedly from his post as ranking Democrat on the intelligence committee, where he has pressed for a congressional authorization of military force against the Islamic State, and as a member of the Benghazi committee, where he tried to steer the investigation away from the role of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the attack on the American government compound.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a challenge,\u201d Mr. Schiff said. \u201cIn the minority you don\u2019t have the power of subpoena. You have the power of relationships and the ability to shine the public spotlight on issues, but you have to use that leverage judiciously.\u201d\nMr. Schiff, who represents a northern swath of Los Angeles County, helped found the Democratic Study Group on National Security in 2003 to go deep into national security concerns. He minors in transportation, as the author of the Rim of the Valley Corridor Study Act.\nYouthful, with a ruddy and cheerful visage, Mr. Schiff, 56, whose wife is actually named Eve, comes off like the guy who in high school talked to his prom date\u2019s mother in the kitchen about the goings-on at the community garden.\nBut when he wants to hit, he does. On Monday morning, Mr. Schiff poked at Mr. Trump on Twitter, where the president had retreated to make pre-emptive attacks on the hearing, one of the few that congressional Republicans have staged to air evidence of Russian tampering with the election.\nAs the hearing opened, Mr. Schiff moved to paint Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign as repeatedly in collusion with Russian officials, a possibility Mr. Comey conceded is now the subject of a federal investigation.\n\u201cIs it possible that all of these events and reports are completely unrelated and nothing more than an entirely unhappy coincidence?\u201d Mr. Schiff said. \u201cYes, it is possible. But it is also possible, maybe more than possible, that they are not coincidental, not disconnected and not unrelated and that the Russians use the same techniques to corrupt U.S. persons that they employed in Europe and elsewhere. We simply don\u2019t know, not yet. And we owe it to the country to find out.\u201d\nWith that, Mr. Schiff elicited responses from Mr. Comey and Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency, by pressing them on whether the president\u2019s Twitter messages and the statements by his aides to defend them had damaged America\u2019s relations with allies like Britain and Germany.\nAdmiral Rogers concurred with a strenuous denial by the British government that the Obama administration had asked its intelligence service Government Communications Headquarters, or GCHQ, to carry out surveillance of Trump Tower. He also acknowledged that it complicated America\u2019s relationship with Germany to have Mr. Trump refer publicly to the Obama administration\u2019s eavesdropping on Chancellor Angela Merkel, an operation that was made public by Edward J. Snowden.\nMr. Schiff, who was born in Massachusetts, was raised by a Democratic father and a Republican mother, and he has a photo in his office of his grandfather posing with President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Henry Cabot Lodge. A graduate of Stanford and Harvard Law School, Mr. Schiff was a United States attorney in Los Angeles, where he convicted the first F.B.I. agent indicted for espionage in an old-style Cold War case involving a honey trap named Svetlana. Before being elected to Congress, he served in the California State Legislature.\nMr. Schiff has a son in middle school and a daughter at Northwestern University, and he moved his family to Washington in 2003. He alternates from family-only weekends to heavy work weekends, often spent in California, where he is thought to be considering a Senate run should Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat, decide not to seek another term.\nFor now, Mr. Schiff is focused on all things Trump. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us can say where the investigation will conclude,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Schiff said. \u201cIt is very much in the public interest that we try to find out.\u2019\u2019", "date": "March 20, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/20/us/politics/adam-schiff-house-intelligence-committee.html", "tags": "hearing schiff limited \u201c democrats inquiry leverages committee comey \u201d trump adam power"}
