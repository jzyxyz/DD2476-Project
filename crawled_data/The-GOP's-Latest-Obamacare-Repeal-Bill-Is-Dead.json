{"title": "The GOP's Latest Obamacare Repeal Bill Is Dead", "content": "Republican leaders have decided not to vote on Obamacare repeal legislation this week, effectively ending the party\u2019s latest effort to wipe away the 2010 health care law.\nWhen, and whether, they will try again remains to be seen. But at least for the moment, the GOP\u2019s seven-year crusade to undo the Affordable Care Act lies in shambles \u2015 and insurance for the millions of Americans who depend on the law remains intact.\nThe decision to shelve repeal legislation came during a weekly caucus meeting on Capitol Hill, as leaders acknowledged that the the latest proposal, from Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), lacked the support it required to pass.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have the votes,\u201d Cassidy said afterwards.\nSen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) had announced her intention to vote against the measure on Monday, joining two of her colleagues, Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.). That left Republicans with just 49 votes, one short of the 50 they needed.\nAnd the clock was ticking, because special authority allowing Republicans to pass repeal with a simple majority, rather than the 60 votes it takes to overcome a filibuster, ends on Sept.\u00a030.\n\u201cWe basically ran out of time,\u201d said Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), a co-sponsor of the repeal bill.\u00a0\nAs Graham and Cassidy have promoted their bill in the last two weeks, and GOP leaders got behind it, it appeared for a while that repeal legislation, a version of which had come within one vote of passing in July, might finally get through the Senate\u00a0\u2015 putting it on track for quick approval in the House and then signature by the president.\nEven on Tuesday, Republicans were vowing not to give up.\nMany in the party already have their eyes on a new push for repeal, using the same special legislative authority, once they are done working on an upcoming bill to cut taxes.\n\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of fight left in us,\u201d\u00a0Graham vowed on Tuesday.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t given up on trying to change the American health care system,\u201d added Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).\nBut the failure of the Graham-Cassidy legislation, following the collapse of the July effort, has made clear that Republicans still do not agree among themselves on how to replace the ACA,\u00a0and have no policy plans living up to promises \u2015 from Trump and other party leaders \u2015 that they can deliver better, cheaper health care to more people.\nThe Affordable Care Act has helped millions to get health coverage, bringing the number of people without insurance to historic lows and improving both access to care and financial security. But because people at higher incomes don\u2019t qualify for the law\u2019s tax credits, many of them face high premiums and high out-of-pocket costs \u2015 in some cases, more than they paid previously\u00a0and, in the worst instances, more than they can realistically afford.\nThose higher costs are largely a function of the law\u2019s new requirements on insurers \u2015 to cover everybody, regardless of pre-existing conditions, and to provide comprehensive benefits with each policy. Republicans have decried these effects, but every plan they proposed would have left many millions without insurance and gutted protections for pre-existing conditions.\nGraham-Cassidy was one such plan. It would have cut Medicaid, replaced the ACA with a less generous state-based program and undermined insurance regulations.\nBy 2026,\u00a0it would have left an additional 21 million people without insurance, according to an estimate from the University of Southern California-Brookings Institution Schaeffer Initiative for Innovation in Health Policy.\nThe ACA\u2019s performance varies enormously across the country, with thriving markets in states like California and faltering ones in states like Tennessee. A big reason for the struggles, where they exist, is that insurers are not attracting enough of the younger and healthier consumers they need to balance their books \u2015 forcing the carriers to jack up premiums or pull out of markets altogether.\nBut in most parts of the country, markets appeared to be stabilizing until this year, when Trump took office. His administration has\u00a0slashed funding for advertising and outreach, and mused\u00a0frequently about allowing the program to collapse. The president has also threatened to cut off\u00a0a set of payments,\u00a0currently the subject of a legal dispute, that insurers need to offset some of their costs.\nIn just the last few weeks, a bipartisan effort to shore up the markets \u2015 by guaranteeing those insurer payments and giving states some extra flexibility over management of the program \u2015 had gotten underway in the Senate Committee on Health,\u00a0Education,\u00a0Labor and Pensions (HELP).\nThe chairman, Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), called off those talks last week, as GOP leaders prepared for a floor vote on Graham-Cassidy. On Tuesday, Democratic leaders reiterated their interest in restarting those talks.\n\u201cWe are ready at this moment to roll up our sleeves and work with our colleagues on bipartisan solutions,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.).\nBut having seen repeal die and then come back from the dead several times already, the ACA\u2019s defenders were also promising not to stand down \u2015 and were encouraging their allies to keep up the pressure.\n\u201cWe are not out of the woods yet by any means,\u201d said Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), ranking Democratic member of the Senate HELP committee. \u201cAnd until Trumpcare is finally set aside, we will not stop fighting, because this last version was the worst one yet.\u201d", "date": "\n09/26/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/graham-cassidy-failure_n_59ca9a35e4b07e9ca11f3d1b", "tags": "leaders latest obamacare repeal gop republicans \u201d \u2015 insurance senate bill dead care health"}
