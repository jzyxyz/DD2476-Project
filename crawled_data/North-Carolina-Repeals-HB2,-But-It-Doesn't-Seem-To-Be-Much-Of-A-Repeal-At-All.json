{"title": "North Carolina Repeals HB2, But It Doesn't Seem To Be Much Of A Repeal At All", "content": "North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D) on Thursday signed into law legislation to repeal a controversial law that bars people from using the restroom that corresponds with their gender identity and adds provisions to block nondiscrimination protections. The\u00a0compromise on HB2, which the House and Senate passed Thursday,\u00a0was quickly criticized by LGBTQ groups. \n\u201cThe initiative is not a repeal,\u201d Chris Sgro, executive director of Equality NC, said before the Thursday votes. \u201cIt\u2019s doubling down on the discrimination that HB2 exacts \u2015 it\u2019s HB2.0.\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t do anything to better the lives of LGBT North Carolinians,\u201d he continued.\nHB2 was signed into law last year and led to widespread backlash against the state. The compromise, which was announced late Wednesday and quickly pushed through both chambers of the legislature Thursday, repeals the law but still allows ample room for discrimination.\nThe bill lawmakers voted on Thursday includes some portions from HB2, including prohibiting municipalities from passing any ordinance regulating private employment or public accommodations. In the compromise, this prohibition extends until 2020. In other words, not only would cities be barred from passing their own nondiscrimination protections for LGBTQ people, but they also wouldn\u2019t be able to enact measures raising the minimum wage or protecting workers.\nJosh Stein, the state attorney general, said lawmakers should have done a \u201cclean repeal\u201d of HB2.\n\u201cWhile this is an improvement over current law, a clean repeal of HB2 would have been the right thing to do. Local governments should be able to protect their people from discrimination,\u201d he wrote on Facebook.\nThe City of Charlotte said it was pleased with the law pushed through Thursday, noting HB2 had harmed businesses and economic growth in the city. It\u00a0announced the city\u2019s discrimination ordinance would return to the way it was before Feb. 22, 2016, when Charlotte added LGBTQ protections to its nondiscrimination ordinance.\u00a0That addition led to the passage of HB2.\nCharlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts said she was \u201cdisappointed that the Republican leaders in the General Assembly continue to see LGBT people as unequal and refuse to let cities like Charlotte govern themselves.\u201d\nThe push for the deal was tied to a deadline set by the NCAA. The group\u00a0said last week that it would continue to not hold events in the state because of the law, and a sports event recruiter said Tuesday that the organization had threatened to drop North Carolina\u2019s bids from consideration if the legislature hadn\u2019t addressed the law in the next 48 hours. The NCAA is set to announce host cities for its postseason events through 2022 on April 18.\n\u201cOnce the sites are selected \u2026 those decisions are final,\u201d the NCAA said.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Thursday\u2019s compromise law will satisfy the NCAA, which said its board of governors will decide by next week whether to include North Carolina among the hosts.\nThe Atlantic Coast Conference, another sports group that had boycotted North Carolina after the passage of HB2, said Thursday evening that it would \u201creopen the discussion\u201d with its council of presidents regarding future events in the state.\nThe Associated Press calculated this week that HB2 would cost the state over $3.7 billion over 12 years from lost business.\nLeading up to lawmakers\u2019 votes Thursday, LGBTQ advocates pushed against the compromise.\n\u201cNorth Carolinians want a clean repeal of HB2, and we urge our allies not to sell us out,\u201d Sgro said. \u201cThose who stand for equality and with LGBTQ people are standing strong against these antics. We\u2019ve got less than 24 hours before the NCAA deadline. There is no time to waste \u2015 our leaders must fight for what\u2019s right, and that is full repeal.\u201d\nDr. William Barber II, president of the North Carolina chapter of the NAACP, called the bill a \u201cbait and switch.\u201d\nChad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, pushed legislators to avoid being \u201csellouts\u201d\u00a0in a statement released Wednesday evening.\n\u201cThe consequences of this hateful law will only continue without full repeal of HB2,\u201d he said. \u201cSellouts cave under pressure. Leaders fight for what\u2019s right.\u201d\n\u201cPassing this bill would mean that North Carolina continues to be one of the very few states where it\u2019s illegal for cities to protect the rights of their residents,\u201d Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, said earlier Thursday.\nSimone Bell, Lambda Legal\u2019s Southern regional director, said the deal was just a \u201cquick fix.\u201d\n\u201cThere can be no compromise on civil rights, and HB2 has proven this over the last year,\u201d she said. \u201cThis so-called \u2018deal\u2019 may be an economic quick fix, but it continues to write discrimination into the law. A deal that leaves out LGBT North Carolinians, and particularly transgender people, should be no deal at all. It is shameful to stamp a start date on equality. Lawmakers should demand a full, clean repeal, and enact comprehensive nondiscrimination protections and not leave our community unprotected in the name of \u2018compromise.\u2019\u201d\nIn a statement Wednesday, the governor said the bill wasn\u2019t perfect, but it was a start.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a perfect deal, but it repeals House Bill 2 and begins to repair our reputation,\u201d Cooper said.\nBut Sarah Gillooly, policy director for the ACLU of North Carolina, called the deal \u201cdisgraceful\u201d and, before Thursday\u2019s votes, urged the governor to reconsider.\n\u201cLawmakers must vote against this proposal, and should it reach his desk, Governor Cooper should withdraw his support and veto it,\u201d she said.\nFormer Gov. Pat McCrory (R), who signed the bill last year, said he supported the compromise.\n\u201cI urge the Generally Assembly and the current governor to finally stick with an agreement that is a common-sense reset that respects privacy and allows the Supreme Court to resolve this issue for our nation once and for all,\u201d McCrory wrote on Facebook. \u201cHow our country legally defines gender ultimately will not be decided by any mayor, governor, state legislature, or university chancellor on the board of the NCAA.\u201d\nLawmakers came close to repealing HB2 in December of last year but the effort failed, in part because it barred local municipalities from passing their own nondiscrimination ordinances for a six-month period.\nThis article has been updated through the day with new details and comments.", "date": "\n03/30/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/north-carolina-hb2-repeal_n_58dd005be4b05eae031d72a3", "tags": "much repeals thursday compromise repeal \u201d seem carolina north law"}
