{"title": "White Supremacist Rep- Steve King Wonders Why Being White Supremacist Is Offensive", "content": "\ufeffWhite supremacist Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), fresh off the news that he\u2019ll face a Republican primary challenger next year, wondered aloud why being a white supremacist is such a bad thing.\nKing, in an interview with The New York Times published Thursday, said he doesn\u2019t mind that the American population includes a range of races \u2015 as long as the culture stays white and European.\n\u201cWhite nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization \u2014 how did that language become offensive?\u201d he said. \u201cWhy did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?\u201d\nThe Times article suggests that President Donald Trump\u2019s demonizing statements about immigrants \u2015 especially his lies about Latinos and his border policies \u2015 were crafted and shaped, in part, by King over the years:\u00a0\nThe interview is one of the few times King has discussed his embrace of white nationalism since HuffPost\u2019s Chris Mathias outed his viewpoints during his 2018 campaign for re-election. He narrowly won in November, despite extensive HuffPost reporting revealing that he repeatedly\u00a0promoted neo-Nazis on Twitter, endorsed\u00a0a white supremacist candidate for Toronto mayor, and gave an interview to an Austrian publication affiliated with Europe\u2019s neo-fascist \u201cidentitarian\u201d movement, in which King talks fluently of the \u201cGreat Replacement,\u201d a white nationalist conspiracy theory.\nThe GOP was largely silent on King through 2018, until it was revealed he might lose to Democratic challenger J.D. Scholten.\nNext year, King will face Iowa state Sen. Randy Feenstra in a race to represent Iowa\u2019s 4th Congressional District in the House of Representatives.\nUPDATE: 2:12 p.m. \u2015\u00a0King released a statement on Twitter, saying he \u201crejects\u201d the labels of white supremacy, arguing that \u201cunder any fair political definition, I am simply a Nationalist.\u201d (As HuffPost has previously reported, King is a white supremacist.)", "date": "\n01/10/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/steve-king-white-supremacist-offensive_n_5c3752afe4b045f676897d45", "tags": "face steve offensive white \u201d \u2015 interview supremacist wonders times king rep- huffpost"}
