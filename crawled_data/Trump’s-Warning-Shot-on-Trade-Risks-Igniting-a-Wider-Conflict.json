{"title": "Trump\u2019s Warning Shot on Trade Risks Igniting a Wider Conflict", "content": "LONDON \u2014 In the more than seven decades since the end of the Second World War, leaders of the planet\u2019s major economies have operated on a rough consensus that trade offers a potent form of inoculation against the outbreak of military hostilities.\nThe United States and its allies have constructed an economic and security order centered on the notion that communities connected by commerce have a shared interest in maintaining peace. They forged institutions focused on reducing tariffs and other impediments to trade, with the World Trade Organization as the linchpin.\nBut now this collective understanding is under assault by the very power that has championed it most fervently. As President Trump on Thursday delivered steep tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, provoking vows of retaliation from enraged producers, he risked setting off a global conflict.\nThough Mr. Trump stepped back from plans to impose tariffs on every nation \u2014 exempting, for the time being, Canada and Mexico \u2014 he did so while exerting additional pressure: He emphasized that tariffs could ultimately land on both countries unless they bend to American demands in renegotiations of the North American Free Trade Agreement.\nIn raising the possibility of sparing other allies from the tariffs, Mr. Trump kicked off a fierce scramble for exemptions that has left American trade partners confused and alarmed. He has amplified the sense that the United States has forsaken its role as a leading defender of a global trading system anchored by clear rules of engagement.\n\u201cThe level of tension between the United States and its major trading partners is probably more tense than it has been at any time since the early 1980s,\u201d said Meredith Crowley, an international trade expert at the University of Cambridge in England.\nWhether Mr. Trump has begun a trade war or merely a skirmish will depend on what happens next \u2014 which countries win a reprieve from the tariffs, and which opt to retaliate.\nMr. Trump\u2019s decision to back off from across-the-board tariffs came in the face of strident warnings from the American business world and leaders of his own Republican Party that such a course would damage the American economy and alienate allies.\nStill, Mr. Trump brushed aside talk that tariffs were a reckless provocation, appearing to relish his role as instigator. \u201cTrade wars are good and easy to win,\u201d he tweeted this month.\nMr. Trump maintains that Americans have been outwitted by savvier trading partners, with tariffs needed to force jobs to return to the United States.\nHistory has proved humbling for those inclined to seek victory through trade conflicts. Commerce has tended to plunge, with the working class suffering lost jobs and diminished livelihoods. Alliances have been frayed, heightening international tensions.\nMany economists and international-relations experts assume that Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs could play out much the same way, isolating the United States while imperiling a global economic expansion.\nNot least, the tariffs seem likely to present the World Trade Organization with a potentially existential crisis.\nThe organization has been described as the referee for global commerce, settling disputes on the basis of rules adopted by consensus among its 164 members. Now, the referee may be on the verge of losing control of the game.\nIn justifying its tariffs as a response to a supposed threat to national security \u2014 a contention that has drawn derision from economists \u2014 the Trump administration has virtually ensured a challenge from the European Union via a complaint filed with the trade organization. That would put the institution in a predicament in which any course risks undermining its authority.\nThe trade organization could rule in favor of the United States, deferring to American sovereignty and its right to determine its national security policies. But that would hand every country on earth a template to break with the norms of international trade.\n\u201cThis would open the floodgates to everyone bringing in broad exceptions,\u201d said Ms. Crowley, the Cambridge expert.\nOr the body could rule against the United States, rejecting the argument that metal forged in Europe poses a mortal peril to Americans. The Trump administration might then ignore the ruling and carry on, forcing the W.T.O. to give countries the right to retaliate.\nHostilities would most likely expand well beyond steel and aluminum. Mr. Trump\u2019s pledge of tariffs has enraged and astounded American allies whose fortunes are tied to producing these metals, like Japan, South Korea, Germany and Taiwan.\nOn Wednesday, the European Union outlined plans to retaliate with tariffs on a variety of American goods, including motorcycles, rice and bourbon. If reprisals continued, Europe might limit exports of other American agricultural products, intensifying its push against genetically modified crops. In the most extreme case, Europe might even impede American investment.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a real chance that everyone reacts very negatively,\u201d said Jennifer A. Hillman, an international trade expert at Georgetown Law Center in Washington.\nFaced with a rebuke from the global trading body, Mr. Trump might pull the United States out of the institution.\nAs he addressed a delegation at the trading body\u2019s Geneva headquarters on Monday, W.T.O.\u2019s director general, Roberto Azev\u00eado, worried openly about a descent into a trade war.\n\u201cIt is clear that we now see a much higher and real risk of triggering an escalation of trade barriers across the globe,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce we start down this path, it will be very difficult to reverse direction. An eye for an eye will leave us all blind and the world in deep recession.\u201d\nTrade frictions are a constant in the global economy. Governments wield tariffs, import quotas and other instruments to protect sensitive industries. But a trade war is different, holding the potential to damage living standards on multiple continents.\n\u201cYou start viewing it as a conflict between nations,\u201d said Adam S. Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a research institution in Washington. \u201cYou put a premium on doing damage rather than deterring bad behavior.\u201d\nMr. Trump and his advisers appear to be calculating that, as the largest economy on earth, the United States possesses enough muscle to dictate the terms of world trade.\n\u201cThey are under the delusion that the United States has been screwed by the global system that it created,\u201d Mr. Posen said. \u201cThey apparently think that everyone else will fold if they stand up.\u201d\nThat idea, he added, is about to be exposed as wrong.\nAs the United States grappled with the Great Depression, a Republican-controlled Congress seized on protectionism as the fix, adopting the infamous Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 to wall off American farms and factories from foreign competition.\nThe law sharply increased tariffs on hundreds of goods \u2014 from sugar to shoes to iron. American trading partners responded with their own tariffs, and commerce deteriorated, deepening the depression.\nAfter Democrats captured control of Congress and the White House in 1932, tariffs fell sharply, bolstering American trade. But Britain, France, Germany and other European powers maintained steep tariffs. Trade disintegrated, exacerbating nationalist animosities that exploded into World War II.\nThe last substantial outbreak of trade hostilities played out in the 1980s, as the United States grappled with the consequences of a rising Japan. The American auto industry \u2014 caught unprepared for the public\u2019s embrace of smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles \u2014 lobbied Washington for tariffs to limit a surge of Japanese imports. President Ronald Reagan ultimately pressured Japan to voluntarily restrict auto exports to the United States.\nJapanese-made automobiles sold in the United States soared in price. Seeking to avoid tariffs while improving trust, Japanese car companies began setting up plants to make their vehicles in the United States, employing American workers.\nTrade advisers to Mr. Trump cite this history as an example of how an aggressive stance can set up fruitful trade negotiations. But major differences separate that episode from today.\nBack in the 1980s, auto plants needed to be built somewhere to serve swelling American demand for small cars. Japan was firmly dependent on good relations with Washington for its security, making it prone to avoid conflict.\nToday\u2019s primary American trade antagonist is China, ruled by the apparent president-for-life Xi Jinping, whose nationalist credo does not leave room for caving to pressure from Washington. The world faces a glut of steel, much of it made in China. Whatever tariffs the Trump administration maintains, foreign steel manufacturers are not likely to construct new plants in the United States.\nAmong proponents of liberalized trade, the most hopeful history may be the most recent chapter.\nIn 2002, President George W. Bush put tariffs on steel to protect American producers against imports. Then, as now, companies that make products using steel vastly outnumbered those that produce the metal. As automakers and other steel buyers confronted higher costs, the tariffs eliminated some 200,000 jobs, according to one study.\nForeign steel producers filed a challenge at the W.T.O., which ruled that the United States had acted without justification. Europe prepared a list of American goods to stick with retaliatory tariffs. Mr. Bush backed down.\nBut if the global trading apparatus successfully defused that crisis, the current situation presents a different challenge given the nature of the commander waging the attack.\n\u201cThe fundamental view of this administration seems to be, somewhat bizarrely, that the United States has not benefited from trade,\u201d Ms. Crowley said. \u201cIt seems like it\u2019s not really registering how damaging this could be.\u201d", "date": "March 10, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/10/business/trump-trade-war-history.html", "tags": "american shot wider mr. warning risks united states igniting conflict trump \u201d trade tariffs \u2014"}
