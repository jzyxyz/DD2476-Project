The attackers then rushed to the nearby Borough Market, where they ditched their vehicle and began stabbing people in the area.\nPolice declared the incidents\u00a0acts of terrorism\u00a0and have arrested at least 12 people in connection with the attack.\nTrump also used his Twitter account to throw cold water on the gun control debate that typically occurs after mass shootings in the U.S. He also took a shot at London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who had urged residents and visitors to remain calm. Khan is London\u2019s first Muslim mayor.\nEarlier this week, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to revive the controversial executive order that intended to temporarily bar citizens of six Muslim-majority countries from traveling to the U.S.\nLawyers at the Department of Justice on Thursday filed two emergency applications with the nation\u2019s highest court, requesting to block two lower court rulings that halted the implementation of the president\u2019s second attempt at the travel ban.\u00a0\nTrump\u2019s executive order, a so-called \u201cwatered-down\u201d version of his first attempt,\u00a0seeks to ban citizens of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering the U.S. A previous version of the ban included Iraqis.\u00a0\nThe DOJ\u00a0said in a statement that Trump is not required to admit into the U.S.\u00a0\u201cpeople from \u201ccountries that sponsor or shelter terrorism\u201d until they are properly vetted by his standards.\nAfter the applications were filed in the Supreme Court on Thursday, the American Civil Liberties Union vowed to continue fighting\u00a0the White House\u2019s attempts to push the travel ban forward.\nThis is a developing story.
