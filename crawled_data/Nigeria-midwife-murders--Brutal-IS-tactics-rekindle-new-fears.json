{"title": "Nigeria midwife murders: Brutal IS tactics rekindle new fears", "content": "The execution-style killings of two Muslim midwives in north-eastern Nigeria have raised fears that the Islamist insurgency is far from over.\nThe Islamic State (IS) group and the political tensions ahead of elections in Africa's most-populous nation are being blamed for the upsurge in violence this year.\nHauwa Liman and Saifura Ahmed Khorsa both worked for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) when they were kidnapped along with another female aid worker from the town of Rann in March.\nFighters from a Boko Haram faction loyal to IS - known as the Islamic State West Africa Province (Iswap) - were behind their abduction.\nMs Khorsa, 25, was shot dead in September and a month later Ms Liman, her 24-year-old colleague, was also murdered. \nLocal journalists who have seen the two videos released by the jihadists after the killings say the women, wearing white hijabs, were forced to kneel down with their hands tied.\nThey were then shot from behind at close range.\nIt is not clear what demands the militants were making - but whatever they were the group says the government ignored them.\nIswap, which is believed to receive instructions from IS leadership, has raised its profile this year and was behind the kidnapping of 110 schoolgirls from the town of Dapchi in February.\nMost of the girls were released after a month, except for a 15-year-old who has reportedly refused to convert to Islam and remains in captivity.\nIswap appears to be the dominant Boko Haram faction since a split in the leadership of the group emerged in August 2016.\nBoko Haram launched its insurgency nearly nine years ago taking over large swathes of land in north-eastern Nigeria where it declared an Islamic caliphate.\nIts leader, Abubakar Shekau, gained worldwide notoriety five years later after kidnapping more than 200 schoolgirls from Chibok.\nIn the wake of this, Shekau's fighters joined IS, but it appears to have been a fractious relationship.\nIS sacked him two years ago replacing him with Abu Musab al-Barnawi.\nMany analysts believe Shekau - who is now rumoured to be ill - was removed because of the tactics he used, often sending child suicide bombers to launch indiscriminate attacks on civilians that included targeting places of worship.\nOver the last three-and-a-half years, most areas under the militants' control have been recaptured, though the two factions have continued to carry out attacks.\nBut IS' influence is becoming more visible - and security analyst Abdullahi Yalwa believes some of Iswap's insurgents are possibly being trained at IS camps outside the country. \nIswap has been behind several daring and deadly attacks against the military in the last four months.\nThey brazenly drive in convoy in gun-mounted trucks to target soldiers in an apparent attempt to acquire more weapons and armoured vehicles.\nThe reticent military has not commented much on the attacks, except to say they were \"fierce\".\nMany observers believe the authorities are cautious about revealing the actual death toll for fear of demoralising soldiers fighting the insurgents.\nIt also puts in doubt a key campaign promise made by President Muhammadu Buhari when he came to power in 2015 that he would defeat Boko Haram.\nAnd there are now growing concerns about security in Nigeria ahead of elections due in February when Mr Buhari will be seeking a second term in office.\nMr Yalwa says Boko Haram attacks are motivated by three factors:\nHe adds that with thousands of people displaced by the conflict yet to return to their communities, security is increasingly becoming a key campaign issue.\nThe two factions operate in different parts of the north-east.\nShekau's group is active mainly around Sambisa forest - where some of the Chibok girls were mainly thought to be held - and other areas bordering Cameroon.\nIswap is based around the Nigerian border with Niger, although they both move around the Lake Chad area.\nAfter the split, there were reportedly deadly clashes between the factions, which has helped the military's cause. \nWithin Iswap there are also reported tensions.\nIt is believed a top commander in that group, Mamman Nur, was killed by his close lieutenants in the wake of the release of the Dapchi girls.\nThere is a suspicion that he unilaterally ordered the release of some of schoolgirls without any ransom payment.\nAccording to the respected Daily Trust newspaper, this \"soft approach\" could not be tolerated and he was killed on 21 August.\nIf he is dead, it could explain the group's more hard-line approach in the last two months - and the murders of aid workers, reminiscent of IS tactics in the Middle East.\nMr Yalwa says the involvement of IS makes the insurgency more tactical, technical and complicated.\n\"Extra military intelligence and experience\" is needed to make the security forces more proactive, he says.\nDefence Minister Mansur Muhammad Dan-Ali is more upbeat, saying the recruitment of more soldiers - 10,000 are being trained every year - and better equipment will win the day in the end.\nBoth the UK and US are giving military support - and the government hopes to start taking delivery of 12 Super Tucano A-29 aircraft from the US next year, he says.\nBut for the communities in the north-east it is like deja-vu - with the vicious cycle of violence unlikely to end any time soon as both the militants and the army step up their operations ahead of the election.", "date": "17 October 2018", "href": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-45876440", "tags": "haram military tactics midwife fears murders nigeria rekindle says two brutal group boko new attacks year behind iswap"}
