{"title": "'Game Of Thrones' Built Up Its Female Characters Just To Watch Them Fall", "content": "Bells\u00a0continuously chime as Daenerys Targaryen\u00a0(Emilia Clarke), sitting atop her fire-breathing dragon Drogon, stares out at King\u2019s Landing. She\u2019s enraged, having recently watched Queen Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey) order the execution of her best friend, Missandei (Nathalie Emmanuel), shortly after her dragon-child Rhaegal was speared to death.\nBefore facing those losses, Dany fought the army of the dead, held her adviser Jorah Mormont (Iain Glen) as he took his last breath and discovered that her new love, Jon Snow (Kit Harington),\u00a0was actually her nephew, the true heir to the Iron Throne. At this particular moment, she\u2019s unhinged. And bells are ringing.\u00a0\nAnd ringing, and ringing.\nWith the Red Keep in sight, Dany snarls as she decides to forgo everything she\u2019s become in favor of an old Targaryen tactic: \u201cBurn them all.\u201d She goes full villain in the penultimate episode of \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d scorching enemies and innocents alike as she surrenders to madness.\nYet many viewers saw little forewarning that\u00a0a character twist of this magnitude was coming, and her erratic change of heart was a punch to the gut. Instead of the satisfying conclusion of a long descent to depravity, Dany suddenly shifts modes, from a woman who graciously earned loyalty over seven seasons to a power-hungry monster who murders thousands of men, women and children.\nSure, she wasn\u2019t always perfect, but the Daenerys Targaryen we knew was the fearless Mother of Dragons. She was Khaleesi, who united the Dothraki after the death of Khal Drogo (Jason Momoa), later rallying them to fight for her claim to the Seven Kingdoms. She was Mhysa, who freed the Unsullied and was lifted up by the slaves of Mereen. Dany rose from the ashes to break chains and then risked everything to protect Jon and the North from the Night King\u2019s army.\u00a0\nTo see a woman so fully represented over 70 hours of television, especially in a fantasy epic, was groundbreaking. But, with a final season of just six episodes, showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss decided that a couple of scenes were enough to turn the unburnt beauty bad \u2015 and essentially muddied her yearslong journey.\u00a0\nThe \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d audience had devoted so much time to Dany, and other characters, only to now watch Benioff and Weiss hurry along the ending (and\u00a0move on to their \u201cStar Wars\u201d trilogy). Why couldn\u2019t they, after spending nearly two years crafting the final season, show us Dany\u2019s slow decline into madness? Why do we have to watch \u201cInside the Episode\u201d to figure it all out?\u00a0\nSurely George R.R. Martin, who wrote the unfinished \u201cSong of Ice and Fire\u201d book series on which the HBO show is based, told Benioff and Weiss where he wanted the storyline to go:\u00a0\u201cMad Queen\u201d Dany destroys King\u2019s Landing, demonstrating that humanity, not necessarily the dead, is the true enemy. The thing is, the showrunners decided to shorten the final two seasons of \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d to seven and six episodes respectively, and rush through key plot points to reach Martin\u2019s goal. And it\u2019s turned into a bit of a nonsensical mess.\nSure, make Dany evil \u2015 women can be monsters, too. We\u2019ve certainly seen glimpses of her \u201cmadness\u201d in the past, whether it be callously watching as her brother Viserys (Harry Lloyd) is killed by Khal Drogo\u00a0in Season 1 or perhaps prematurely burning alive\u00a0the father and brother of Samwell Tarly (John Bradley) in Season 7.\nBut whereas, lately, the show tells us what to think, the books present Dany\u2019s inner monologue. Readers can see how she fights to shake her violent family history as not only her actions but her wide-ranging relationships with siblings, friends and lovers are described.\nFrom \u201cA Storm of Swords\u201d:\nAlthough \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d used to give us more context around characters and their decision-making, once it passed the books\u2019 timeline in Season 6, the series faltered a bit in terms of depth. It didn\u2019t show us the intricacies of Dany\u2019s small council, her romance with Jon or her friendship with Missandei, who is only a young girl in Martin\u2019s novels. Perhaps if we saw the show\u2019s version of Dany and Missandei have a meaningful conversation about fear or loneliness \u2015 versus men and sex \u2015 we would have understood Dany\u2019s underlying fragility and why Missandei\u2019s murder triggered a rage within her. Instead, we saw the one woman of color\u00a0become a plot device to turn Dany, as well as her own lover Grey Worm (Jacob Anderson), to the dark side.\nThat\u2019s all to say that the recent rushed storylines have prevented us from getting that nuance we previously used to connect the dots.\u00a0\nThe same flaw also hurts other women on \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d including Cersei, Brienne of Tarth (Gwendoline Christie) and Arya Stark (Maisie Williams).\nBrienne is one of the strongest warriors in Westeros. She killed Stannis Baratheon (Stephen Dillane) and took down the 6-foot-6 Hound\u00a0(Rory McCann) \u2015 with a few solid punches, might we add. Yet she turned into a puddle of mush when Jaime Lannister (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) left her for Cersei \u2015 something she would\u2019ve never done three seasons ago. In one sense, it\u2019s wonderful to see a vulnerable woman on screen. But Brienne \u2015 who is rarely shown out of armor \u2015 sobbing\u00a0in a nightgown\u00a0came out of left field. (Love makes us do crazy things?)\nAnd Cersei was so shocked and afraid to meet her rubbly end during Episode 5, Season 8, that it\u2019s easy to forget\u00a0she once told Ned Stark (Sean Bean): \u201cIn the game of thrones, you win or you die.\u201d The ruthless Cersei we\u2019ve studied over eight seasons, the most cunning of the cunning, would\u2019ve known to flee the city when she saw dragon fire (especially if she wanted to protect her unborn child). Or she would\u2019ve at least had another plan in case those scorpion artillery weapons didn\u2019t work out.\u00a0\nWe\u2019re not watching the most adventurous show in the world for uninventive writing. Yet here we are.\u00a0\nDuring the most recent episode, The Hound easily convinces Arya to go home and forget about killing Cersei. She hugs him goodbye, gives up on Cersei and tries to make it safely out of King\u2019s Landing.\u00a0\nEh, what?\u00a0We\u2019ve watched Arya train for years to become an assassin. She just destroyed the Night King with a stab of a dagger! She doesn\u2019t fear death! She just traveled weeks to get to the capital for one sole purpose: to murder the woman who betrayed her family.\nToo-fast, terribly thought-out writing has reduced \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d to a soap opera. We miss the scenes where\u00a0Dany argues the advice of Ser Barristan Selmy (Ian McElhinney).\u00a0Or when Arya secretly soaks up intel from Tywin Lannister (Charles Dance). Or how about when\u00a0Sansa Stark feeds her abusive husband Ramsay\u00a0(Iwan Rheon) to his own hounds?\u00a0\nNow we see a half-baked \u201cMad Queen\u201d and a woman like Sansa crediting sexual violence, not her own strength, for making her a power player in Westeros.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s that bad.\u00a0\nRiddle me this: Why does a show featuring four leading ladies have barely any female writers? (Bonus: Michelle MacLaren was the only female director brought on to helm episodes, the last of which aired in 2014.)\u00a0Although Gursimran Sandhu\u00a0is credited as a staff writer for Season 8 on IMDb, only two other women,\u00a0Jane Espenson and Vanessa Taylor, wrote for the series, with\u00a0both of their runs ending by 2013. That, my little birds, is the root of a very big, now unfixable problem.\nEspenson helped craft scenes like the aforementioned death of Viserys, and Taylor had a say in\u00a0that memorable lunch between Sansa, Margaery (Natalie Dormer) and Olenna (Diana Rigg) as well as Arya and The Hound\u2019s Brotherhood Without Banners meetup. Those back-and-forths soar in comparison to Season 8\u2019s Sansa-Dany stares or Cersei\u2019s unexplained cowardice.\u00a0\nClearly, Sandhu couldn\u2019t have singlehandedly saved the final season, but other women\u2019s voices in the writers\u2019 room might have provided more perspective into these characters\u2019 closing motivations.\nStill, Martin created these women, and Benioff and Weiss have shown they can write strong dialogue for them on this show. It just feels like the latter two\u2019s desire to be in a galaxy far, far away perhaps trumped their desire to give these ladies what they deserve: earned arcs.\u00a0", "date": "\n05/14/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/game-of-thrones-women-daenerys-cersei-arya-sansa_n_5cd98811e4b0796a95dfd968", "tags": "female cersei characters game show season watch \u201d \u2015 woman fall thrones built dany"}
