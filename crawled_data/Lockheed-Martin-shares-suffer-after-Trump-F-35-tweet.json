Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20.\"\nThe F-35 is the Pentagon's most expensive weapons programme, costing about $400bn (\u00a3316bn).\nLockheed shares were down 4.2% at $248.51 in morning trading.\nJeff Babione, Lockheed's F-35 chief, said the company understood concerns about affordability, but added: \"It's an amazing programme. It's great value and I look forward to any questions that the  President-elect may have.\"\nHe was in Israel on Monday with US Defence Secretary Ash Carter as the country prepared to take delivery of first F-35 fighters.\nIsrael is among a small number of US allies to buy the plane.\nMr Trump's missive comes a week after he condemned as \"out of control\" the cost of a new Air Force One plane being built by Boeing.\nIsrael - which signed a deal this year for $38bn in US military aid - has ordered 50 of the new fighter jets, each priced at around $100m.\nDonald Trump's Twitter account wasn't always the powerful spectacle it has become.\nHis interaction with Twitter began much like any other high profile account managed by a group of marketing professionals. \nRead in full - The Commander in Tweet", "date": "12 December 2016", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-38286750", "tags": "us lockheed tweet cost suffer israel trump shares donald fighter martin president-elect"}
