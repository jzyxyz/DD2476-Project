{"title": "Michael Flynn Resigns as National Security Adviser", "content": "Michael T. Flynn, the national security adviser, resigned on Monday night after it was revealed that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence and other top White House officials about his conversations with the Russian ambassador to the United States.\nMr. Flynn, who served in the job for less than a month, said he had given \u201cincomplete information\u201d regarding a telephone call he had with the ambassador in late December about American sanctions against Russia, weeks before President Trump\u2019s inauguration. Mr. Flynn previously had denied that he had any substantive conversations with Ambassador Sergey I. Kislyak, and Mr. Pence repeated that claim in television interviews as recently as this month.\nBut on Monday, a former administration official said the Justice Department warned the White House last month that Mr. Flynn had not been fully forthright about his conversations with the ambassador. As a result, the Justice Department feared that Mr. Flynn could be vulnerable to blackmail by Moscow.\nIn his resignation letter, which the White House emailed to reporters, Mr. Flynn said he had held numerous calls with foreign officials during the transition. \u201cUnfortunately, because of the fast pace of events, I inadvertently briefed the vice president-elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian ambassador,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI have sincerely apologized to the president and the vice president, and they have accepted my apology.\u201d\n\u201cI am tendering my resignation, honored to have served our nation and the American people in such a distinguished way,\u201d Mr. Flynn wrote.\nThe White House said in the statement that it was replacing Mr. Flynn with retired Lt. Gen. Joseph K. Kellogg Jr. of the Army, a Vietnam War veteran, as acting national security adviser.\nMr. Flynn was an early and ardent supporter of Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy, and in his resignation he sought to praise the president. \u201cIn just three weeks,\u201d Mr. Flynn said, the new president \u201chas reoriented American foreign policy in fundamental ways to restore America\u2019s leadership position in the world.\u201d\nBut in doing so, he inadvertently illustrated the brevity of his tumultuous run at the National Security Council, and the chaos that has gripped the White House in the first weeks of the Trump administration \u2014 and created a sense of uncertainty around the world.\nEarlier Monday, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, told reporters that \u201cthe president is evaluating the situation\u201d about Mr. Flynn\u2019s future. By Monday evening, Mr. Flynn\u2019s fortunes were rapidly shifting \u2014 his resignation came roughly seven hours after Kellyanne Conway, a counselor to the president, said on MSNBC that Mr. Trump had \u201cfull confidence\u201d in the retired general.\nAnd when he did step down, it happened so quickly that his resignation does not appear to have been communicated to National Security Council staff members, two of whom said they learned about it from news reports.\nOfficials said Mr. Pence had told others in the White House that he believed Mr. Flynn lied to him by saying he had not discussed the topic of sanctions on a call with the Russian ambassador in late December. Even the mere discussion of policy \u2014 and the apparent attempt to assuage the concerns of an American adversary before Mr. Trump took office \u2014 represented a remarkable breach of protocol.\nThe F.B.I. had been examining Mr. Flynn\u2019s phone calls as he came under growing questions about his interactions with Russian officials and his management of the National Security Council. The blackmail risk envisioned by the Justice Department would have stemmed directly from Mr. Flynn\u2019s attempt to cover his tracks with his bosses. The Russians knew what had been said on the call; thus, if they wanted Mr. Flynn to do something, they could have threatened to expose the lie if he refused.\nThe Justice Department\u2019s warning to the White House was first reported on Monday night by The Washington Post.\nIn addition, the Army has been investigating whether Mr. Flynn received money from the Russian government during a trip he took to Moscow in 2015, according to two defense officials. Such a payment might violate the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, which prohibits former military officers from receiving money from a foreign government without consent from Congress. The defense officials said there was no record that Mr. Flynn, a retired three-star Army general, filed the required paperwork for the trip.\nRepresentative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement late Monday that Mr. Flynn\u2019s resignation would not close the question of his contact with Russian officials.\n\u201cGeneral Flynn\u2019s decision to step down as national security adviser was all but ordained the day he misled the country about his secret talks with the Russian ambassador,\u201d said Mr. Schiff, noting that the matter is still under investigation by the House committee.\nTwo other Democratic lawmakers \u2014 Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan and Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland \u2014 called for an immediate briefing by the Justice Department and the F.B.I. over the \u201calarming new disclosures\u201d that Mr. Flynn was a blackmail risk. \u201cWe need to know who else within the White House is a current and ongoing risk to our national security,\u201d they said in a statement.\nRepresentative Devin Nunes, Republican of California and the chairman of the House intelligence committee, was supportive of Mr. Flynn until the end. \u201cWashington, D.C., can be a rough town for honorable people, and Flynn \u2014 who has always been a soldier, not a politician \u2014 deserves America\u2019s gratitude and respect,\u201d Mr. Nunes said in a statement.\nThe White House had examined a transcript of a wiretapped conversation that Mr. Flynn had with Mr. Kislyak in December, according to administration officials. Mr. Flynn originally told Mr. Pence and others that the call was limited to small talk and holiday pleasantries.\nBut the conversation, according to officials who saw the transcript of the wiretap, also included a discussion about sanctions imposed on Russia after intelligence agencies determined that President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s government tried to interfere with the 2016 election on Mr. Trump\u2019s behalf. Still, current and former administration officials familiar with the call said the transcript was ambiguous enough that Mr. Trump could have justified either firing or retaining Mr. Flynn.\nMr. Trump, however, had become increasingly concerned about the continued fallout over Mr. Flynn\u2019s behavior, according to people familiar with his thinking, and told aides that the media storm around Mr. Flynn would damage the president\u2019s image on national security issues.\nStephen K. Bannon, the president\u2019s chief strategist, asked for Mr. Flynn\u2019s resignation \u2014 a move that he has been pushing for since Friday, when it became clear that the national security adviser had misled Mr. Pence.\nAround 8:20 p.m. Monday, a sullen Mr. Flynn was seen in the Oval Office, just as preparations were being made for the swearing-in of newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin. Soon after, Mr. Flynn\u2019s resignation letter started making the rounds.\nAdministration officials said it was unlikely that Mr. Kellogg would be asked to stay on as Mr. Flynn\u2019s permanent replacement. Mr. Flynn brought Mr. Kellogg into the Trump campaign, according to a former campaign adviser, and the two have remained close. K. T. McFarland, the deputy national security adviser who also was brought on by Mr. Flynn, is expected to leave that role, a senior official said.\nOne person close to the administration, who was not authorized to discuss the personnel moves and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that retired Vice Admiral Robert S. Harward is the leading candidate to replace Mr. Flynn, although Mr. Kellogg and David H. Petraeus are being discussed. It was not clear whether Mr. Petraeus is still expected to appear at the White House this week, as initially discussed by advisers to the president.\nMr. Flynn\u2019s concealment of the call\u2019s content, combined with questions about his management of his agency and reports of a demoralized staff, put him in a precarious position less than a month into Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency.\nFew members of Mr. Trump\u2019s team were more skeptical of Mr. Flynn than the vice president, numerous administration officials said. Mr. Pence, who used the false information provided by Mr. Flynn to defend him in a series of television appearances, was incensed at Mr. Flynn\u2019s lack of contrition for repeatedly embarrassing him by withholding the information, according to three administration officials familiar with the situation.\nMr. Flynn and Mr. Pence spoke twice in the past few days about the matter, but administration officials said that rather than fully apologize and accept responsibility, the national security adviser blamed his faulty memory \u2014 which irked the typically slow-to-anger Mr. Pence.\nThe slight was compounded by an episode late last year when Mr. Pence went on television to deny that Mr. Flynn\u2019s son, who had posted conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton on social media, had been given a security clearance by the transition team. The younger Mr. Flynn had, indeed, been given such a clearance, even though his father had told Mr. Pence\u2019s team that he had not.\nOfficials said classified information did not appear to have been discussed during the conversation between Mr. Flynn and the ambassador, which would have been a crime. The call was captured on a routine wiretap of diplomats\u2019 calls, the officials said.\nBut current Trump administration officials and former Obama administration officials said that Mr. Flynn did appear to be reassuring the ambassador that Mr. Trump would adopt a more accommodating tone on Russia once in office.\nFormer and current administration officials said that Mr. Flynn urged Russia not to retaliate against any sanctions because an overreaction would make any future cooperation more complicated. He never explicitly promised sanctions relief, one former official said, but he appeared to leave the impression that it would be possible.\nDuring his 2015 trip to Moscow, Mr. Flynn was paid to attend the anniversary celebration of Russia Today, a television network controlled by the Kremlin. At the banquet, he sat next to Mr. Putin.\nMr. Flynn had notified the Defense Intelligence Agency, which he once led, that he was taking the trip. He received a security briefing from agency officials before he left, which is customary for former top agency officials when they travel overseas.\nStill, some senior agency officials were surprised when footage of the banquet appeared on RT, and believed that Mr. Flynn should have been more forthcoming with the agency about the nature of his trip to Russia.", "date": "Feb. 13, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/13/us/politics/donald-trump-national-security-adviser-michael-flynn.html", "tags": "security adviser officials resigns house trump \u201d flynn michael national"}
