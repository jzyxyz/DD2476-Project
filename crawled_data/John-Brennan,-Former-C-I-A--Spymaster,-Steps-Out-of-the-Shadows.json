{"title": "John Brennan, Former C.I.A. Spymaster, Steps Out of the Shadows", "content": "On June 4, John Brennan, the former C.I.A. director, made the long drive from suburban Virginia to New Jersey. He had plans to dine with his brother and an old high school friend. The evening would be a respite from Brennan\u2019s public feud with the president of the United States, whom Brennan unfailingly refers to as \u201cMr. Trump.\u201d A few days before, Brennan wrote an op-ed calling Trump \u201ca snake-oil salesman.\u201d The paper\u2019s editors tried to persuade Brennan to use the word \u201cpresident,\u201d but Brennan refused. \u201cI said no, I\u2019m not going to refer to him as \u2018president,\u2019\u2009\u201d Brennan told me. \u201cBecause he doesn\u2019t deserve that, in my mind. Yes, he won the most electoral votes. But I think he has demonstrated, over and over again, that he is unfit to carry out the responsibilities of that office.\u201d Trump fired back at Brennan a few hours after the op-ed was published, tweeting out a quote from a former Secret Service agent who had appeared on \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d Brennan was both a \u201cliar\u201d and \u201ca liar about being a liar,\u201d the guest said.\nAround 7, Brennan arrived at the restaurant with his brother, Tom, a small-businessman who dabbled in real estate. Wearing crisp shirts tucked into jeans, the brothers could have been mistaken for any two Irish guys from North Jersey who made good. Brennan waved across the bar to his old friend Mike, an off-duty bartender nursing a pint of Guinness. Mike sat behind John during homeroom at their Catholic high school. \u201cRoom 204, Brother Christopher,\u201d recalled Brennan, a collector of details.\nThe brothers ordered two more, and the three men repaired to a table by the window, overlooking the street. They talked about their summer plans, who was sick, who was well, old rock concerts they\u2019d been to \u2014 the Who, Mountain, the Rolling Stones at Madison Square Garden \u2014 and how much had changed since the old days. Mike told a story about Chuck Wepner, the inspiration for Rocky Balboa, whom they knew from their boyhood summers on the Jersey Shore.\n\u201cHe had a very marginal career, but he fought Ali,\u201d said Tom.\n\u201cHe could take a punch,\u201d said Brennan.\nBrennan himself could pass for a retired boxer. He is now 62, and his face seems to bear the evidence of some long struggle, its overhanging brows draping the eyes in shadow. He stands just over six feet tall, with broad shoulders and a gait marked by three hip replacements and multiple knee surgeries. Brennan served through the entire Obama presidency, first as the White House counterterrorism czar, then as director of the C.I.A. A Middle East specialist and trained Arabic speaker, he was involved in decision-making about Osama bin Laden, the Arab Spring, Benghazi, ISIS, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Syria, the Iran deal and Russian election meddling. Ben Rhodes, Obama\u2019s aide and speechwriter, calls Brennan \u201cthe principal architect\u201d of the administration\u2019s drone policy and \u201cin some ways, the White House\u2019s principal liaison to the intelligence community\u201d during Brennan\u2019s years in the White House. Micah Zenko, an expert on drone policy and a fellow at the British think tank Chatham House, calls Brennan \u201cthe most lethal bureaucrat of all time, or at least since Henry Kissinger, who would pick up the phone and implore military commanders to bomb grids in northern Vietnam.\u201d Now Brennan was out, having traded world-bestriding power for a handful of gigs: adviser on world events for clients of Kissinger Associates, visiting scholar at Fordham University and the University of Texas, commentator on breaking news for MSNBC.\nA few of Brennan\u2019s colleagues from the Obama years said that I should be careful not to judge him by appearances. The dagger-eyed enforcer I had seen glowering behind the table in Senate committee hearings, they insisted, was not the man they knew. Indeed, Brennan\u2019s voice is softer than his face, and different from the streetwise directness of his brother. It is the voice of a mild-mannered civil servant \u2014 cerebral, courtly, deferential and exquisitely self-conscious. \u201cHe\u2019s so shy, in one sense,\u201d former Vice President Joe Biden told me. \u201cHe\u2019s not a gregarious guy.\u201d The light residue of his New Jersey accent seems almost aristocratic; when he drops a syllable from government to make gub-ment, it sounds like a well-worn pet name.\nThe Brennans ordered mussels and steaks. Mike got half a rack of ribs. By the time the food came, the talk had turned to Trump. Mike said he had heard a story about the Trump Organization stiffing a friend of a friend on a sizable landscaping bill.\n\u201cI was sitting in my kitchen with my wife,\u201d Brennan said. \u201cI said to Kathy, \u2018If there were any other president who criticized me privately, much less publicly, I\u2019d be devastated.\u2019 I really would. Mr. Trump criticizing me? That\u2019s a badge of honor. And the fact that he is, you know, busying himself with tweeting against me? When he said, a few days before, he goes: \u2018I\u2019m going to have to focus on North Korea and Russia. I\u2019ve got to get back to work.\u2019 And then what does he do? His subsequent 20 or 30 tweets are all about Crooked Hillary, or the unconstitutionality of the special counsel. He has this obsession, this manic obsession with, understandably, his fate. Because I think he knows what he\u2019s guilty of. He knows what he has done wrong. And he\u2019s finding that it\u2019s more difficult now to squirm out of it than it has been in the past.\u201d\nTrump has tried to capitalize on Brennan\u2019s involvement in the Russia probe, tweeting out his theories about a C.I.A.-and-F.B.I.-led conspiracy he calls \u201cSpygate.\u201d In Trump\u2019s view, the Justice Department\u2019s investigation of his ties to Russia is a plot by the so-called deep state to undermine his presidency. As evidence, he has offered a series of anti-Trump text messages exchanged by several senior F.B.I. employees who worked on the Clinton email and Russia investigations. Trump has also seized on the revelation of an informant, tasked by the F.B.I. to ask campaign associates about Russia\u2019s hacking of Democratic emails in order to see if they had knowledge of it. Trump has insisted that the investigation was undertaken not because there was a reason to suspect his campaign may have colluded with Russia but because Democrats paid Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence official, to write a \u201cphony,\u201d \u201cfake\u201d 35-page dossier of salacious allegations about Trump and Russia. Instead of dealing with the very real evidence that Russia helped get him elected, Trump prefers to believe that Brennan and his all-powerful C.I.A. were pulling the strings.\nWhile Trump\u2019s theories surrounding the election are half-baked demagogy, he has reason to be preoccupied with Brennan. As Obama\u2019s C.I.A. director, Brennan would have read the top-secret reports supporting the intelligence community\u2019s public conclusion that Vladimir Putin favored Trump and sought to manipulate American voters to elect him. According to The Guardian, Brennan received early intelligence tips from his British counterparts about suspicious contacts between Russia and Trump\u2019s campaign. In summer 2016, he shared that intelligence with the F.B.I. director at the time, James Comey, just as the bureau\u2019s investigation was getting underway.\nWith his Spygate allegations, Trump has tried to turn the Russia investigation into a national referendum on the credibility of the intelligence community, with Brennan and Comey in the starring roles. He seems to sense that many find the C.I.A. and F.B.I. to be fundamentally untrustworthy, and that by attacking them, by forcing people to choose between trusting Brennan and trusting Trump, he could destroy the fragile notion that there is any truth in public life at all.\nFew things bother Brennan more than being called a liar. At the C.I.A., he tried to frame espionage as an honorable vocation. He made a high-profile push to reorganize the agency and stepped up recruitment of and support for racial, sexual and gender minorities. He called his staff \u201cintelligence professionals,\u201d rarely using the word \u201cspy.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t steal secrets,\u201d he once said. \u201cWe uncover, we discover, we reveal, we obtain, we elicit, we solicit.\u201d But from time to time, he bent the truth in ways that are not uncommon for C.I.A. directors and high-ranking presidential aides. Brennan\u2019s evasions differ from Trump\u2019s lies \u2014 they are smaller, less frequent, more deniable. Brennan once asserted that nearly a full year of drone strikes had not killed a single civilian. After the killing of Osama bin Laden, he told reporters that the Qaeda leader had personally \u201cengaged in a firefight\u201d when in fact he was unarmed. (Brennan says he was conveying what he\u2019d heard from Adm. William McRaven, who organized and led the operation. McRaven told me that he told Brennan the Navy SEALs \u201cfought their way up the stairs. I didn\u2019t mean to imply they had been in a firefight with bin Laden.\u201d The miscommunication, he added, was \u201csolely my responsibility.\u201d) Brennan strenuously resisted admitting fault after the C.I.A. probed into the computers of the Senate staff members who were investigating the post-9/11 torture program. He gave the public a sanitized version of the truth and withheld the full one. He did things that the president wanted done but not known. And now, as a private citizen, he was asking the people to believe him about \u201cMr. Trump.\u201d\nAt dinner, there was a round of wine, and the conversation drifted toward the ad hominem. At one point, some of the saltier remarks caused Brennan to chuckle with mild embarrassment and drop his napkin over my iPhone, which was recording the conversation. Mike and Tom wanted to show me whose side they were on; Brennan was trying to show them respect while keeping them from going too far.\n\u201cHe has been married three times,\u201d Mike said. \u201cHe cheated on his prior wife. Oh, but he\u2019s a family man.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t understand how the evangelicals and the Christian right put up with his antics,\u201d Brennan said.\n\u201cThey make excuses!\u201d Tom said.\n\u201cHis \u2014 he\u2019s a Christian?\u201d Brennan asked, in wonderment. The New Jersey in him seemed ready to continue roughhousing. But moments later, his Washingtonian restraint kicked in.\n\u201cThis, too, shall pass,\u201d he said abruptly. The table fell silent. The waitress came, and the men ordered a round of Irish whiskeys.\nBrennan\u2019s public feud with Trump was just beginning when we first met for coffee in February in a hotel lobby in Norfolk, Va. He had come to Norfolk, home to the largest naval base in the country, to give a public speech for some 2,000 ticketholders. I had come to ask Brennan about Obama\u2019s legacy, but Russia was dominating the national conversation. That morning on Twitter, while waiting to catch his flight in from Washington, Brennan threw a punch at the president: \u201cIt never ceases to amaze me how successful you have been making yourself so small, petty and banal with your tweets. Your insecurity is well deserved, as is your concern over Russia investigation.\u201d\nBrennan told me that he didn\u2019t plan to serve up any red-meat harangues in his speech that night. \u201cI don\u2019t focus on Donald Trump at all,\u201d he said. \u201cI will speak about what\u2019s going on in the world. I will speak about the things that concern me.\u201d\nHours later, Brennan gussied himself up in a tuxedo and enamel cuff links bearing the seal of the C.I.A. Standing onstage at Chrysler Hall, he shifted his bulk from one tasseled black loafer to the other, hardly looking down at the notecards he held in front of his cummerbund. The employees of the C.I.A., he said, belonged to a \u201cprofession,\u201d not some \u201crogue organization.\u201d Globalization, he said, was both inevitable and desirable, though its benefits were unevenly distributed, leading to inequality, migration, populism and the decline of liberal democracy. As the audience warmed to Brennan, his resolve to avoid Trump-related topics began to slip. Twenty minutes on, he raised the possibility of \u201can eligibility requirement for people to run for office, not just here but around the globe,\u201d mandating that candidates display \u201ca familiarity with history, the Constitution, world events.\u201d This brought laughter and some applause.\nHe did not mention Trump by name until late in the Q. and A., when asked if his speaking on political issues might undermine the C.I.A. and call its neutrality into question. \u201cSometimes my Irishness comes up,\u201d Brennan replied. He denied that his critiques of Trump were motivated by partisanship. He talked about Trump\u2019s use of the C.I.A.\u2019s Memorial Wall, which honors the agency\u2019s fallen, as a backdrop for bragging about the crowds at his inauguration. He recalled Trump\u2019s incendiary comments after the fatal protests in Charlottesville. \u201cI\u2019m going to continue to speak out, because I think we\u2019re at a critical stage in our nation\u2019s history,\u201d Brennan said. \u201cWhen I see there is dishonesty and a lack of integrity, yeah, I speak out.\u201d\nBrennan\u2019s willingness to trade blows with Trump is a break from the pattern set by former C.I.A. directors, who have largely stayed quiet during retirement, especially on classified matters that they were personally involved in only months before. In the weeks following the speech, Brennan took aim at many facets of Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 his exit of the Iran deal, his blind loyalty to Israel, his disrespect of alliances, his vicious anti-immigrant rhetoric. But at the core of his attack was Donald Trump the person. Brennan\u2019s argument, culminating in the op-ed, was that Trump\u2019s coarse, selfish and undignified character made him unfit for the job. \u201cIf there is a scintilla of decency left in you,\u201d he tweeted on June 16, responding to a Trump boast about his poll numbers, \u201cyou would focus on your responsibilities, not on yourself.\u201d Brennan has also alluded to what might come out in the investigation by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, about the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia. \u201cI\u2019m not going to get into what I may have known or not known while I was the C.I.A. director,\u201d he told NPR\u2019s Mary Louise Kelly. \u201cIs he afraid that Mr. Putin might have something on him? Maybe. I don\u2019t know, but only Mr. Trump knows what he might be vulnerable to.\u201d\nBy dropping hints like these, Brennan has only fanned the flames of mistrust among Trump and his supporters. The segment of Trump voters who bought into \u201cPizzagate\u201d \u2014 the infamous conspiracy theory that imagined a powerful pedophile ring at a Washington pizza restaurant \u2014 and tune into Alex Jones\u2019s Infowars is now eager to believe in Spygate. But in a curious sense, the wellspring of fear that makes Spygate plausible to frightened outsiders is a mirror image of the disgust that Brennan, the consummate insider, expresses about the president\u2019s character. Over decades, but accelerating in the years since 9/11, the executive branch\u2019s ability to conduct national security with little transparency or oversight has grown steadily, to the point that the president and his advisers wield powers that are incomprehensible to the layperson and daunting even to elected officials who might like to rein those powers in. The more imperial the executive has become, the harder it is to grapple with what any administration is actually doing in real time, and the more public debate is reduced to the question of whether the president and his team can be trusted as human beings.\nIt is hard for Trump to make the case for his own trustworthiness, given his erratic moods, frightening rhetoric and gleeful betrayals. Some in Congress, like Representatives Trey Gowdy and Paul Ryan, have defended the F.B.I.\u2019s Russia investigation and pushed back against the Spygate narrative. \u201cA confidential informant is not a spy,\u201d says Senator Lindsey Graham, undermining Spygate\u2019s central premise. But others want to take seriously the possibility that candidate Trump fell victim to those same imperial powers that Brennan encouraged Obama to use. \u201cThere is virtually no abuse of civil liberties that John Brennan hasn\u2019t been a part of,\u201d Senator Rand Paul told me by email, citing drone strikes, torture and surveillance. Later, he called on Brennan to testify publicly about \u201cany secret info on candidate Trump ... from European or British intelligence sources.\u201d Brennan\u2019s warnings about Trump seemed at risk of getting lost in the noise, one among many competing sets of allegations.\n\u201cI think his credibility is zero,\u201d Brennan said on MSNBC, hours after the North Korea summit. \u201cHe continually lies to the American people and to the public,\u201d he thundered. \u201cHow can anybody believe what he is saying?\u201d His jabs were getting sharper and snappier; he was adapting to a media environment in which points don\u2019t land without repetition and hyperbole. He was, in other words, beginning to sound more like his tweets, and perhaps just a bit like Donald Trump.\nBrennan\u2019s father, Owen, was a blacksmith who immigrated to New Jersey from Ireland in 1948. Owen\u2019s own father, Brennan told me, was \u201ca supporter, an affiliate, say,\u201d of the Irish Republican Army. Brennan moved twice while growing up, from one apartment to another before settling in a three-family house in North Bergen. His grandmother lived on the top floor. \u201cMy dad worked construction in those years,\u201d Tom remembers. \u201cThose jobs were not easy to come by.\u201d When the construction business slowed down, Owen would find odd jobs. For a time, he commuted into Manhattan to fold papers for The Daily News. The Brennans scrimped so John and his brother and sister could be taught by Franciscan nuns, who made heaven and hell as tangible as two neighborhood subway lines. Brennan resolved to go to heaven, and the priesthood seemed like a sure way of getting there. He read about the popes and noticed that there had never been an American one. He decided that he would be the first. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be a priest, why not aspire to be the highest priest there is?\u201d he told me.\nAs a teenager, even as he absorbed his parents\u2019 morality and work ethic, Brennan felt torn between the cloistered priesthood and a life of worldly experience, between pleasing his parents and escaping into a world that was larger than New Jersey. He read Saint Augustine and Hermann Hesse. He found a mentor in his cousin Thomas, who had traveled to Malaysia and Vietnam and was stationed in Indonesia, working at U.S.A.I.D. Thomas mailed back reel-to-reel audio recordings recounting his travels. On Sundays, after church, the family would gather around the kitchen table at Thomas\u2019s father\u2019s house to listen to them. Thomas told the family how lucky they were to be living in the free world, where there was adequate food and shelter and real opportunity. John wanted to follow Thomas\u2019s example. He applied to and was accepted by the Georgetown School of Foreign Service but could not attend; the tuition was too high. Instead, he enrolled at Fordham, a Catholic university on the other side of the Hudson. He took the bus to school and worked nights at a supermarket deli. He devoted himself to studying Arabic and spent part of his junior year in Cairo.\nA few years later, in 1980, as a graduate student in political science at the University of Texas at Austin, Brennan would write his master\u2019s thesis on the state of human rights in Egypt, under the rule of Anwar Sadat. The thesis grapples with a thorny problem of United States policy in the Middle East \u2014 how much repression by our allies is tolerable? Brennan responded to the problem with equivocation. In his view, Sadat\u2019s repression of radical groups and censoring of the press was justifiable for the sake of \u201cthe preservation of democracy.\u201d Other measures, like interfering with elections, were unjustifiable \u201cregime perpetuation.\u201d In the case of Egypt, he found, the ends do justify the means, but only sometimes.\nBack in New Jersey, Brennan married his hometown girlfriend. They had met at a bar in Edgewater; years before, Brennan played Little League baseball with her older brother. As Brennan tells it, he applied to join the C.I.A. around this time, after seeing a newspaper ad. An interviewer strapped his arm to a polygraph machine and asked if he had ever been a member of an organization that sought to overthrow the government of the United States. Brennan, not wanting to carry even the smallest deception on his conscience, said that he voted for Gus Hall, the Communist Party candidate for president, in 1976. (Decades later, Brennan volunteered the story of his Communist vote to a young woman who had asked him if participating in protests might disqualify her from working for the C.I.A. Reports of Brennan\u2019s vote reached right-wing critics of the Obama administration, who tried to use this nearly 40-year-old vote as evidence of ongoing Communist sympathies. Brennan now says that it was cast in protest against the partisanship of the Watergate era.)\nAt the C.I.A., Brennan quickly distinguished himself as a \u201cdeep select,\u201d a young officer given extra visibility and fast promotions. After a tour in Saudi Arabia, he grew close to George Tenet, who was working at the National Security Council as a liaison between the C.I.A. and the Clinton White House, where Brennan sometimes delivered the president\u2019s daily brief. Tenet became Clinton\u2019s third C.I.A. director in 1997, and George W. Bush kept him on. Tenet had repeatedly tried to warn Bush\u2019s team about the growing Qaeda threat, but not everyone shared his sense of urgency. Tenet and Bush took their failure to stop the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, personally. Waves of guilt and panic poured down through the C.I.A.\u2019s hierarchy as rumors spread that there might be a second wave of attacks. \u201cI remember going into the counterterrorism center,\u201d says Jami Miscik, who led the C.I.A. Directorate of Intelligence at the time. \u201cThe analysts had their children sleeping on the floor. It was such an intense effort.\u201d\nThe atmosphere was one of ongoing crisis; high officials began to make distinctions between what was legal and what was right. Scraps of intelligence seemed to point toward terrifying hypotheticals: What if the C.I.A. got its hands on a Qaeda suspect who knew about a dirty bomb about to go off in New York City? The White House authorized the C.I.A. to carry out waterboardings, sensory deprivation and prolonged stress positions. At the time, they were known as Enhanced Interrogation Techniques, or E.I.T.s; eventually most everyone outside the C.I.A. would come to acknowledge them as forms of torture. After Gina Haspel, the current C.I.A director, faced tough questioning in the Senate over her role in the use of E.I.T.s, she wrote a letter stating that \u201cthe enhanced interrogation program is not one the C.I.A. should have undertaken,\u201d given \u201cthe benefit of hindsight.\u201d The letter stops short of expressing any regret.\nBrennan has had to walk a similar tightrope about his own record on waterboarding. Immediately after 9/11, he was the fourth-highest official in the C.I.A.\u2019s hierarchy, responsible for logistics, budgets and personnel. Though he has said that he was not in the operational chain of command, he was copied on at least 50 internal C.I.A. emails describing the interrogation of one detainee. Unlike Obama, who admitted that \u201cwe tortured some folks,\u201d he has refrained from referring to waterboarding as \u201ctorture.\u201d But Brennan has repeatedly claimed that he took issue with the practice at the time, although he \u201cdid not try to stop it.\u201d The three people who were above him at C.I.A. say they do not remember him giving voice to any qualms he might have had. I asked Brennan who else might remember him speaking up at that time. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say that I told Mary, Joe and Sue,\u201d Brennan replied. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t as though I was wearing that opposition on my sleeve throughout the agency. I expressed it privately, to individuals.\u201d\nTensions between the Bush White House and the C.I.A. reached a head over the 2003 decision to invade Iraq. After C.I.A. analysts refused to validate a nonexistent connection in Prague between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda, the Bush White House settled on the theory that Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. After the invasion, when the W.M.D.s failed to turn up, Bush\u2019s team scapegoated Tenet over what he had supposedly called \u201cslam dunk\u201d intelligence to support the W.M.D. theory. Tenet, who wrote in his memoirs that \u201cslam dunk\u201d actually referred to something else, retired in 2004; Brennan left the agency the following year. The lesson for Brennan\u2019s generation of C.I.A. officers was a demoralizing one \u2014 that serving the president could sometimes mean acting as political cannon fodder when things went wrong.\nIn 2008, three weeks after Barack Obama won the Iowa caucuses, Brennan gave $2,300, then the legal maximum, to his campaign. Outside government for the first time since college, Brennan had spent a few years as head of the Analysis Corporation, selling contracts for custom software that the government could use to manage terrorist watch-lists. By the time of Obama\u2019s Iowa win, he was one of a few former national-security officials who advised the candidate and his inner circle through email lists and conference calls.\n\u201cIt was important that someone with John\u2019s counterterrorism credentials threw his weight behind Obama,\u201d says Samantha Power, who later served as Obama\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations. \u201cObama was seen by some as a community organizer who had been on the Hill for all of five minutes. John was a validator with real street cred in the national-security community.\u201d Biden concurs: \u201cEveryone knew John was a hard-ass,\u201d he says. \u201cHe knew the intelligence community. He was a great asset for the president to have.\u201d\nBrennan met Obama for the first time in Chicago during the transition and quickly won him over. They shared grievances about the Iraq war and what Brennan now calls \u201ca very strong alignment of views\u201d on counterterrorism, \u201cin terms of how aggressive to be \u2014 to do everything possible to protect American lives, without making the problem worse.\u201d Both believed that American relations with the Arab world depended on making it clear that the United States could go to war with terrorism while making peace with Islam.\nAt first, Brennan wanted to be C.I.A. director, but he withdrew his name when liberal commentators started to scrutinize his post-9/11 record at the C.I.A. Instead, he became Obama\u2019s \u201ccounterterrorism czar.\u201d By dint of hard work and proximity to the White House decision-making process, his power would come to surpass that of most cabinet members. Brennan and Obama \u201chad a mind meld,\u201d says Gen. James Clapper, who was the director of national intelligence under Obama. \u201cAlmost like finishing each other\u2019s sentences.\u201d Brennan held the title of assistant to the president and sat on both the National Security Council and its influential deputies\u2019 committee. When the time came to decide whether to sign off on a drone strike, Brennan would brief Obama on the intelligence and guide him through the decision, sometimes late at night, in the East Wing residence. With that, the C.I.A. had acquired a powerful ally with daily access to the president.\nIn hindsight, the list of deliverables that Obama promised under the banner of Change may have been overambitious: Exit the bad war in Iraq. Win the good war in Afghanistan. Close Guant\u00e1namo. Ban torture, and pursue a \u201creckoning\u201d for the torturers, in the words of Obama\u2019s soon-to-be attorney general, Eric Holder. What\u2019s more, Obama said he would reform the habit of unnecessary state secrecy that had given rise to such malignant policies. \u201cIt\u2019s no coincidence that one of the most secretive administrations in history\u201d pursued policies \u201cthat could not stand up to sunlight,\u201d Obama said, slamming Bush on the campaign trail. The day after his inauguration, Obama signed a memo called \u201cTransparency and Open Government\u201d that promised to create \u201can unprecedented level of openness\u201d and \u201cdisclose information rapidly.\u201d A second Obama memo about public information requests asserted that, \u201cin the face of doubt, openness prevails\u201d; requests should be responded to \u201cpromptly and in a spirit of cooperation.\u201d\nObama\u2019s transparency phase did not last long. His administration secretly subpoenaed reporters\u2019 phone records and brought at least nine leak-related prosecutions, more than all previous administrations combined. The spirit of cooperation had long fled the scene by his final summer, when I visited his chief of staff at the time, Denis McDonough \u2014 a lean, gray-haired man in his 40s whose weary eyes suggested that those who had stuck with Obama through all eight years were now running on fumes. He grew up in an Irish-Catholic family with 11 children in Minnesota and became close to Brennan during Obama\u2019s first term. Each had a small, windowless chamber in the basement beneath the Oval Office. In those days, Brennan would wake just after 4 in the morning and work in his basement West Wing office until 9 or 10 each night. Back home, he would continue working in his secure basement office and retire around midnight. During crises, he would sometimes forgo the commute and sleep in his chair. Vacation meant following the Obamas to Martha\u2019s Vineyard and taking his own family along. \u201cThe president trusted John inherently, and I don\u2019t think he ever felt that trust was misplaced,\u201d McDonough told me later. \u201cHe was absolutely critical to President Obama\u2019s success.\u201d\nEight minutes into my allotted 10 with McDonough, I spoke two words \u2014 \u201csignature strikes\u201d \u2014 and was met with a gentle interruption.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask a different question?\u201d McDonough said. \u201cBecause I\u2019m not going to answer a question on something like that.\u201d\nAt the end of Obama\u2019s second term, most of the public remained unaware of the existence of \u201csignature strikes\u201d \u2014 the killing of suspected militants whose identities are unknown, but who are deemed to be valid targets based on certain predetermined criteria, or \u201csignatures.\u201d Signatures can come from a connection to a suspected terrorist phone number, a suspected Al Qaeda camp or the fact that a person is armed. \u201cIt could be a bunch of guys on a hillside doing a live fire exercise and speaking Uzbek,\u201d said a former administration official, who requested anonymity to discuss matters that are still nominally secret. The official added: \u201cThere are practical and legal problems with that.\u201d\nUnder Obama, the C.I.A. had authority to conduct many signature strikes without case-by-case presidential approval. The practice led to accusations that the C.I.A., to artificially suppress civilian casualty numbers, was deeming any unidentified military-age male killed in a strike zone as a presumed militant. Further confusing matters, officials can designate new areas to be \u201careas of active hostilities\u201d or temporary war zones in places like Libya and Somalia. The term \u201csignature strike\u201d only applies outside of war zones; inside of these areas the rules are significantly looser.\nThe lack of transparency around drone strikes made it hard to understand, let alone defend, United States policy. \u201cThe biggest conflict I had with my leadership was drone strikes,\u201d says one former diplomat who worked in South Asia during Obama\u2019s first term. \u201cOfficial U.S. government policy is that you can\u2019t talk about them, because they don\u2019t exist,\u201d the diplomat continued. \u201cI quickly realized that I couldn\u2019t be a credible representative of the U.S. government without talking about what was on the front page of every single newspaper.\u201d Under Obama, the justification for holding such unaccountable power was the good character of the president and his staff. \u201cDo I want this system to last forever? No,\u201d one senior Obama official told The Washington Post in 2012, referring to the drone program. \u201cWhat is scary is the apparatus set up without John to run it.\u201d\nIf McDonough could not talk about signature strikes, perhaps he could talk about drone strikes against \u201chigh-value targets,\u201d named and known terrorists.\n\u201cAgain, that sounds to me like a question that I\u2019m not in a position to respond to,\u201d McDonough replied.\nWhat did Brennan eat for lunch?\n\u201cJohn ate soup.\u201d McDonough made it clear that he does not look down on soup: \u201cThe soups here are excellent.\u201d And then, lest I think a White House job consisted of lazing around and gorging on the many delectable soups: \u201cHe would eat at his desk.\u201d And then, lest I think Brennan was a slob: \u201cHe is a fastidious character.\u201d Each of his qualifications regarding Brennan\u2019s lunch habits nested neatly into the previous one. This was a polished specimen of Obama-era rhetoric, a series of equivocations bent into the shape of a paper clip.\n\u201cThey were trying to have it both ways,\u201d says Gen. Stanley McChrystal, who led Obama\u2019s campaign in Afghanistan until mid-2010. \u201cThey were trying to convince the hard-liners that we\u2019re doing enough and trying to convince the Islamic world that we\u2019re not doing too much. But it takes more than drone strikes to solve these problems. You have got to stop people from wanting to be terrorists.\u201d\nIf Brennan played a role in acclimating Obama to the dark necessities of counterterrorism, so did unfolding events. His first year was marked by a mass shooting at Fort Hood and the \u201cunderwear bomber,\u201d a terrifying close call in which a Nigerian national almost succeeded in detonating explosives aboard a Northwest Airlines flight to Detroit. There were intense disputes between the White House and the Pentagon over troop levels as the Afghanistan war began to look like a quagmire. Obama \u201cdid not want to be L.B.J.,\u201d McChrystal says. \u201cHe did not want to lead America into a never-ending war.\u201d But Afghanistan \u201cfelt a lot like Vietnam. You just couldn\u2019t get around it. It was a really difficult thing for the administration.\u201d Drones offered Obama a third way, between the bloodletting of a traditional ground war and the embarrassment of retreat. Brennan served as a crucial mediator between the hard-liners on the ground and White House insiders who favored a more judicious approach. \u201cJohn got a reputation on the left as the guy who was overzealous in his use of drones, when in fact he was doing a lot to constrain them,\u201d Ben Rhodes says. \u201cHe was definitely tapping the brakes.\u201d\nAs Obama\u2019s confidence in Brennan grew, so did Brennan\u2019s portfolio. He soon emerged not just as Obama\u2019s chief drone warrior but also as a shadow envoy to much of the Middle East. He helped frame Obama\u2019s landmark Cairo address, intended to reset United States relations with the Muslim world. He hand-delivered a letter from Obama to the embattled president of Yemen. In 2010, Brennan reportedly received a tip from Saudi intelligence that stopped the bombing of two United States-bound cargo planes. In 2013, he met with the Israeli prime minister and military chiefs to coordinate approaches to Syria. He wrangled with difficult allies in Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. As the Syria conflict deepened and Obama drew criticism for his indecision, The Times reported that Brennan\u2019s C.I.A. undertook a billion-dollar covert campaign to arm and train rebels fighting against the Syrian leader, Bashar al-Assad.\nIn May 2011, Brennan helped oversee the operation to kill Osama bin Laden, staying at the White House for three straight days. \u201cJohn was meticulous in his stewardship of that process,\u201d Rhodes recalls. The operation was risky. The trickiest variable was whether the tall man living in the Abbottabad compound was actually bin Laden. During the planning phase, Brennan made it clear that if the gamble failed, the Iraq debacle would not be repeated. This time no one would be blamed for having gotten the intelligence wrong. \u201cIf we go in and bin Laden is not there, that would not be an intelligence failure,\u201d Brennan said at a deputies\u2019 committee meeting, according to Michael Morell, deputy director of the C.I.A. at the time.\nLater that year, Brennan was involved in the decision to kill Anwar al-Awlaki, a United States citizen, whose killing was justified by two legal memos from Obama\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel. The memos found that either the C.I.A. or the military could kill al-Awlaki without violating his constitutional right to due process or the federal ban on assassinations. Awlaki\u2019s 16-year-old son, Abdulrahman, was also killed in Yemen, in a separate drone strike weeks later. Administration officials said that he was not the intended target.\nWith bin Laden and al-Awlaki dead, Obama set about restraining the drone program in earnest. He had Brennan draw up a Presidential Policy Guidance, or P.P.G. For drone strikes conducted outside war zones, it required two forms of \u201cnear certainty\u201d: first, that a target was present; and second, that no civilians would be killed. There was discussion of further reforms: An external body might be convened to approve individual drone strikes, or to review them after the fact. Signature strikes might come to an end. The C.I.A. might lose its drone program altogether. None of these changes wound up happening. The P.P.G. rule book, coupled with Brennan\u2019s move from the White House to leadership of the C.I.A. in 2013, does seem to have had some effect; the number of drone strikes in Pakistan fell sharply. Outside Pakistan, however, the war on terror continued, driven especially by the rise of the Islamic State. Drones allowed Obama to reduce troop deployments and United States casualties, even as the geographic scope of the campaign spread to places like Libya and Somalia.\nIn all, what Obama left behind was a troubling inheritance \u2014 vast, secret and mostly unilateral powers to spy and to kill in the name of fighting the global war on terror, powers that depend more on the good intentions of those who wield them than on any written law. Listening to Obama\u2019s early rhetoric, it was easy to think that he was going to do something to pare those powers back and remove the country from its permanent post-9/11 war footing. The war against Al Qaeda would continue, he said, but with \u201can abiding confidence in the rule of law and due process; in checks and balances and accountability.\u201d He would pursue \u201cthe strongest and most sustainable legal framework,\u201d a legacy \u201cthat outlasts my administration, my presidency, that endures for the next president and the president after that.\u201d\nBut in the end, Obama\u2019s record on counterterrorism was one of continuity, not change. Guant\u00e1namo shrank; it did not close. Obama responded to Edward Snowden\u2019s disclosures by throwing his weight behind the National Security Agency. The C.I.A. kept its drones and signature strikes. Efforts that might have been intended to scale back the drone program wound up codifying it; the series of speeches that Obama presented as part of his \u201cframework\u201d \u2014 road maps to reform \u2014 had the effect of normalizing and putting a humane face on a policy of quasi assassination. During the final months of Obama\u2019s second term came a gesture toward transparency, an executive order requiring the White House to release annually the number of noncombatants killed by drone strikes outside war zones. Their estimates for Obama\u2019s years in office were far lower than those compiled by outside groups.\nTo his successor, Obama bequeathed a much larger counterterrorism apparatus than he himself had inherited; Trump set about making full use of its powers while shaking off Obama\u2019s self-imposed restraints. According to reports in The Times, Trump secretly replaced the P.P.G., ending the centralized Obama-era strike-approval process and lowering a threshold for killing from the P.P.G.\u2019s \u201cnear certainty\u201d that the intended target was present to \u201creasonable certainty.\u201d (The \u201cnear certainty\u201d requirement for no civilian casualties remained in place.) Kill decisions that would have required White House approval were pushed down the chain of command into the Pentagon and C.I.A. Trump seemed keen to deliver on a campaign promise to kill not just ISIS fighters but also those around them. \u201cWe\u2019re fighting a very politically correct war,\u201d he said during the campaign. \u201cYou have to take out their families.\u201d In Somalia, the number of drone strikes doubled during Trump\u2019s first year, according to a report by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism. In Yemen, drone strikes tripled. According to The Washington Post, the C.I.A. showed Trump a video of a strike where operators waited to fire until the target had moved a safe distance away from his family. \u201cWhy did you wait?\u201d Trump reportedly asked.\nWhile Brennan has seized on reports of Trump\u2019s personal crudeness and his bad behavior around the Russia investigation, he has been mostly silent about Trump\u2019s approach to drones. After I sent a question to Obama (who declined to be interviewed) on whether he had concerns about Trump\u2019s use of \u201cthe authorities that you wielded,\u201d Brennan was the one to respond. He said he was \u201cdisturbed\u201d by press reports on the loosening of Obama\u2019s standards and that \u201cevery effort must be made to avoid civilian casualties.\u201d As eager as he was to question Trump\u2019s character, he wasn\u2019t yet ready to question the system under which a demagogue like Trump could wield so much unchecked power.\nBy the time I met Brennan, I had spoken to several former officials who said that the P.P.G. was never intended to tie the hands of Obama\u2019s successor. Such a thing was impossible; the president was the president and could do whatever he wanted. But multiple people involved with its drafting said they saw value in establishing a precedent that the incoming administration would have to make an active decision to throw out. \u201cIt\u2019s like building a dam,\u201d says Harold Koh, who worked closely with Brennan and served as the State Department\u2019s chief lawyer during Obama\u2019s first term. \u201cIf you try to build too high, it takes too long and never gets finished. But if a flood comes and overwhelms it, some people will say, why didn\u2019t we build a higher dam? John did his best.\u201d\nIn late April, I met Brennan for lunch at a Morton\u2019s Steakhouse in Northern Virginia. He sat down in the booth and ordered a Diet Coke with lime. That morning, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, led by one of Trump\u2019s most devoted supporters, Representative Devin Nunes, had released a 253-page report that found no evidence of direct ties between Trump\u2019s campaign and the Russian government. It cited testimony that Brennan had given on the Hill, in which he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know whether or not such collusion \u2014 that\u2019s your term \u2014 existed.\u201d At lunch, Brennan sounded a more suggestive note, telling me he had \u201cserious questions about the extent of that interaction, cooperation, collusion.\u201d He was careful to attribute this sentiment to \u201cwhat I\u2019ve been reading in the press.\u201d\n\u201cI try to be careful with the language that I use,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen people ask me questions, for example, about why is Mr. Trump so submissive to Vladimir Putin, and whether or not Mr. Trump fears that the Russians have something on him, I say, I don\u2019t know. Perhaps. Maybe. I just don\u2019t want to get into details about what I know or don\u2019t know.\u201d He added: \u201cI have to be very mindful of my obligations as far as classified material is concerned.\u201d\nThe waitress returned. Brennan ordered crab cakes. I brought up drone strikes. Trump, it seemed, was making full use of the presidential power to kill.\n\u201cWhat a president does during his or her term is subject to being modified, if not overturned, by successors,\u201d Brennan said. \u201cThere was no illusion, nor could there have been, that what he put into place would\u201d \u2014 and here he paused and looked up at the ceiling \u2014 \u201cdefinitely stay in place in the subsequent administration.\u201d He took a bite of crab cake. \u201cIs there greater tolerance for civilian casualties? Maybe. Sounds like it.\u201d He said he had heard reports from journalists of high civilian casualties in Mosul. Some reports have put the figure as high as 10,000. He said that he found those reports to be concerning. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know the details of it,\u201d he added.\nI asked Brennan about his own decision-making process. His answer suggested a possible reason that he hasn\u2019t been outspoken regarding Trump\u2019s drone policy: He had some degree of confidence, he said, in Gen. John Kelly, Trump\u2019s chief of staff, who had served as an aide to two of Obama\u2019s secretaries of defense. Brennan said he and Kelly had \u201cspent a lot of time on the phone\u201d during Obama\u2019s first term, in \u201clate-night calls, early-morning calls.\u201d Again, with the decisions themselves hidden, the character of the decision maker loomed large.\nAt lunch, Brennan talked about how he would take kill decisions to Obama. \u201cThere were recommendations I made that went both ways,\u201d he said. \u201cTo take action or not take action, that I remember very well. Each of which had consequences. But if you\u2019re not prepared to live with those consequences, then you probably shouldn\u2019t be in those positions. Because. ... \u201d The food was gone and the straw from his Diet Coke lay on the table. He picked it up and began twisting it in his hands. \u201cI agonize over them. I agonize over the decisions. I\u2019m not saying every decision I made was perfect. By no means. It never will be.\u201d Information was often incomplete or dated, he said. The P.P.G. was an attempt to systematize those hard calls. \u201cThat was where we were in the Obama administration,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wanted to have that rigor.\u201d\nThe most famous case in which things went wrong was a 2015 drone strike in Pakistan. Along with the intended Qaeda targets, the strike killed two Western aid workers being held hostage: Giovanni Lo Porto, an Italian, and Warren Weinstein, an American. An internal review conducted by the C.I.A. reportedly concluded that there had been no error on the part of the operators. All procedures had been followed and the near-certainty standard had been met. Jason Amerine, a retired lieutenant colonel from the Army Special Forces who had been searching for Weinstein along with other hostages, told me that his team assessed in 2013 that drone strikes were \u201cthe No. 1 risk to hostages.\u201d Amerine said he blamed the bureaucracy, not the C.I.A. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know any better,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s tragic.\u201d\nIn the White House, Brennan took responsibility for Weinstein\u2019s death, according to one person who was present. He personally apologized to Obama and briefed him on it, twice, in exhaustive detail. Over lunch, Brennan did not deny that this had happened but declined to share his side. \u201cPeople will tell you whatever they want,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are certain things I\u2019m not going to get into.\u201d\nMaybe he could speak in more general terms?\n\u201cSometimes, in war, things happen,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I ever said that precision means it\u2019s going to be foolproof, or collateral-free.\u201d Most nights, he said, he would immediately fall asleep at the end of a 20-hour workday. But sometimes the day\u2019s decisions would keep him up. \u201cI would agonize over them,\u201d he said. \u201cRethink and rethink and rethink. Wonder whether or not I had made the right recommendation, the right decision. If I had heard that something didn\u2019t go as we had planned, I would continue to review it in my mind. What could we have done better? What went wrong? Why did I make that decision?\u201d\nWhy hadn\u2019t Obama gotten rid of signature strikes?\n\u201cWhen you say that signature strikes were supposed to come to an end, I don\u2019t recall that ever being something that was on the table,\u201d he said. He pulled back a bit to give his view of signature strikes, a term that was \u201cthe parlance of the media.\u201d You may not know the target\u2019s name, but you might have other information, he said. You might know that they were determined to carry out an attack, that they were \u201cdirty as hell,\u201d sometimes even \u201cfull Al Qaeda members.\u201d You could still have near certainty. \u201cThere was never an intention on the part of the counterterrorism folks in the Obama administration to end signature strikes,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is just wrong.\u201d\nBrennan said he shared Obama\u2019s position that the military alone should be responsible for drone strikes. Like others I spoke to from the Obama White House, he said this change failed to happen because of a lack of cooperation from Congress. \u201cI\u2019m not acknowledging that C.I.A. has ever had a drone program,\u201d he added, making it clear that he would not discuss what was still classified.\nI brought up the Obama administration\u2019s official tally of civilian drone victims and its wide divergence from estimates made by outside groups. \u201cAre the numbers 100 percent accurate?\u201d Brennan replied. \u201cNo. I\u2019m certain they are not. They\u2019re as close as we could get to an honest representation of combatant and noncombatant deaths. Might not the numbers be a little bit higher on the civilian side? Yeah, they might be. But we really tried to be as honest as possible with it. It\u2019s hard to convince people of the care that is taken, of the anxiety, of the rigor that is applied. Of the deep, deep consideration that is given to these decisions. Of the agony that decision makers or operators go through.\u201d\nDid that sense of moral seriousness still prevail under Trump?\n\u201cI would like to think that nobody would want to kill an innocent person,\u201d Brennan said. \u201cThat nobody would treat this responsibility and these capabilities cavalierly. Unfortunately, I think, sometimes in war, people will have greater tolerance for the deaths of civilians. Because they believe that the end justifies the means. And to me, I think, all life is sacred. Whether you\u2019re a Syrian who is hunkered down in Raqqa who has been abused by ISIS \u2014 they have as much right to live as anyone else. I think the United States, in keeping with our values, needs to do everything possible to protect that person\u2019s life, and not just take it because they happen to be in a war zone.\u201d\nHe picked up the straw, twisting it further in his hands.\n\u201cHow do you balance that?\u201d he asked. \u201cThat\u2019s where the agony comes in.\u201d A few minutes before, he had written this off as subjective, a policy question. Now he didn\u2019t seem so sure. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why this spectrum, a continuum about \u2014 what do you do in order to decimate as quickly as possible the terrorist forces, but at the same time try to protect the lives of that young Syrian boy or girl who is living in this environment of violence, who deserves a chance to live? How do you balance the equities? It\u2019s tough! And throughout the course of the Obama administration, I felt really good that we had a president, and I was part of a team, that really valued protection of American life but also protection of innocent life. And I\u2019m hoping that balance still prevails. But looking at some of the press reports, you know, I wonder if it does. I hope it does. I don\u2019t know if it does.\u201d\nWhat about Trump\u2019s rhetoric? When the president says he wants to kill terrorists\u2019 families, doesn\u2019t that have an effect in the field?\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so you will have very strong, muscular U.S. action. And, it\u2019s, you know, almost, you know \u2014 \u2018Kill them all and let God sort them out.\u2019 That \u2014 that\u2019s wrong. America stands for something.\u201d He talked about just-war theory, the proposition that war can be morally justified but that the standards for waging it must be high. \u201cI have thought long and hard about the decision that this country made to drop nuclear weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Was that the right decision? I don\u2019t know. Did it save a lot of American lives? Yeah, it probably did. Did it result in the deaths of more people than it saved, overall? It probably did. Because there\u2019s no way that the untold people who were killed as a result of those strikes \u2014 U.S. forces never would have suffered those losses. And how do you value life? Is an American life worth so much more than others\u2019 lives? No. I think all life is equal.\u201d\nFor a moment, the issue seemed to be settled. Then he seemed to hear the echo of his own words, which prompted him to add another line to the equation. \u201cBut! When you\u2019re the president of the United States, or when you\u2019re the assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism, your responsibility and obligation is to try to do what you can to protect American lives. But that doesn\u2019t mean that you disregard a responsibility, a responsibility of just being a person, to not take others\u2019 lives in a cavalier and an injudicious fashion. This is the struggle of war.\u201d Brennan\u2019s argument was suspended between his wish that all lives could be treated as equal and his inability to change a political calculus that dictated that they could not.\nA few days later, on May 1, the deadline arrived for Trump to issue his own report on civilian casualties, in keeping with Obama\u2019s executive order. As president, Trump could easily have modified that part of the order, or replaced it with one of his own. Instead, the day came and went with no tally. (To date, none has been released.)\nShortly after that, Brennan\u2019s spokesman emailed what he said was a quote from Brennan in response to my questions on Warren Weinstein. It suggested that Brennan\u2019s thinking was still evolving. \u201c\u2009\u2018Near certainty\u2019 means exactly that,\u201d it read. \u201cTragically, innocents sometimes die, but rarely, at least that was the case during the Obama administration.\u201d It went on: \u201cWar is hell, especially for those who are caught in the crossfire. And it is awful for those who had to make the tough decisions and who have to live with the results.\u201d", "date": "June 27, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/27/magazine/john-brennan-president-trump-national-security-state.html", "tags": "president drone former c.i.a spymaster \u201d shadows obama john brennan steps said"}
