{"title": "Judge Signals Skepticism About Trump\u2019s Bid to Block Subpoena for Financial Records", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday asked sharply skeptical questions of a personal lawyer for President Trump about his attempt to block a congressional subpoena seeking years of financial records from Mr. Trump\u2019s accounting firm \u2014 and suggested that he could rule on the dispute as early as next week.\nThe hearing, before Judge Amit P. Mehta of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia, was an early judicial test of the president\u2019s vow to systematically stonewall \u201call\u201d subpoenas by House Democrats. And Judge Mehta\u2019s questioning left little doubt that he was deeply skeptical about the arguments from Mr. Trump\u2019s legal team, led by William S. Consovoy.\nMr. Consovoy essentially argued that the Constitution does not give Congress the power to investigate potential presidential corruption because determining whether someone broke the law is a function reserved for the executive branch. But Judge Mehta pointed out that under that logic, many famous historical congressional oversight investigations were illegitimate.\n\u201cIs it your view that the Whitewater and Watergate investigations were beyond the authority of Congress?\u201d the judge asked, referring to congressional inquiries of the Nixon and Clinton presidencies. \u201cThey were looking at violations of criminal law.\u201d\nJudge Mehta, a 2014 appointee of President Barack Obama, also said he saw no need for further briefings or arguments because the dispute turned on a question of law, and the Constitution does not permit Mr. Trump\u2019s legal team to compel the House to turn over internal documents as evidence. He said he would let lawyers submit any additional materials they wanted through Friday, then he would make his decision.\nAny ruling by Judge Mehta is likely to be only the beginning of the case. Both sides acknowledged that an appeal was virtually certain, and Mr. Consovoy asked the judge, if he does rule against Mr. Trump, to stay his ruling pending appeal so that the subpoena deadline for Mazars USA, the accounting firm, is not set off before the litigation fully plays out.\nBut Douglas Letter, the general counsel for the House, asked the judge not to stay any such ruling \u2014 or, if he does, to make it conditional on the Trump team expeditiously filing an appeal. The larger threat, he said, was that the Trump team could use the courts to run out the clock on this Congress, thwarting its ability to perform oversight.\n\u201cAny delay undermines the House\u2019s ability to do what the Constitution allows it to do,\u201d Mr. Letter said.\nThe judge\u2019s comments and questioning suggest he is likely to agree with the House that the information it is seeking is within its legitimate oversight roles, rejecting the Trump team\u2019s argument that the subpoena is an illegitimate effort to obtain political dirt without any tie to Congress\u2019s function of deciding whether to enact new laws.\nJudge Mehta repeatedly emphasized Supreme Court case law that suggests that Congress has the authority to perform oversight investigations for the purpose of informing itself and the public about issues of public importance, separate from its lawmaking function \u2014 an argument that Mr. Letter said the House agreed with but did not need to rely upon to win the case.\nAnd he raised doubts about whether he had any authority to second-guess Congress\u2019s motive or the scope of the information it says it wants.\nThe House has said it is investigating Mr. Trump\u2019s finances in part to determine whether he has any hidden business entanglements that make him secretly beholden to foreigners in a way that could create a conflict of interest in his decision-making as president, and that the inquiry could lay the groundwork for tightening laws about presidential finances.\n\u201cWe need to know if the president of the United States is beholden to foreign interests who can hold that over his head,\u201d Mr. Letter said. \u201cObviously these are very legitimate things for Congress to look into.\u201d\nBut Mr. Consovoy pointed to a statement by Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland \u2014 the chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, which issued the subpoena \u2014 that suggested that his motive was instead to find out if Mr. Trump was breaking the law.\nMr. Consovoy also argued that no legislation Congress might conceivably enact could be constitutional because the Constitution limits the legislative branch\u2019s ability to impose limits on the presidency.\nBut Judge Mehta resisted the idea that he should determine that there was no conceivable law Congress might pass that would pass constitutional muster, saying, \u201cYou don\u2019t suggest I have to undertake a constitutional review of legislation that does not exist?\u201d\nAnd Mr. Letter listed a series of existing laws that would be unconstitutional under the Trump team\u2019s logic, like the Presidential Records Act, which prevents presidents from destroying their administration\u2019s records, and an ethics law requiring presidents to make annual financial disclosures.\n\u201cMr. Consovoy seems to be arguing that Congress cannot regulate the presidency,\u201d Mr. Letter said. \u201cOh yeah?
