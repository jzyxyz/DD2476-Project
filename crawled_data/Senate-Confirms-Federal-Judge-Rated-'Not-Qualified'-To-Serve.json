{"title": "Senate Confirms Federal Judge Rated 'Not Qualified' To Serve", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2015 The Senate voted Tuesday to confirm one of President Donald Trump\u2019s judicial nominees, Leonard Steven Grasz, despite the fact that Grasz earned an embarrassing and unanimous \u201cnot qualified\u201d rating from the American Bar Association.\nEvery Republican present voted to confirm Grasz, 56, to a lifetime seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit. That includes moderates like Sens. Susan Collins (Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), as well as retiring Sens. Jeff Flake (Ariz.) and Bob Corker (Tenn.). Every Democrat opposed him in the 50-48 vote.\nIt is extremely rare for the Senate to confirm a judge with such an\u00a0abysmal rating from the national legal organization. The ABA has reviewed more than 1,700 federal judicial nominees since 1989, and only three, including Grasz, have been deemed\u00a0unanimously unqualified. The other two, both nominees of\u00a0President George W. Bush, were withdrawn and replaced with other nominees after the ABA\u2019s assessment came in.\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) seemed baffled that Grasz was even getting a vote.\n\u201cA panel of nonpartisan legal experts unanimously concluded that this man is not fit to be a judge,\u201d\u00a0he said on the Senate floor. \u201cWhat else do my colleagues need to know?\u201d\nThe ABA\u00a0interviewed more than 180 people\u00a0connected to Grasz, who was Nebraska\u2019s chief deputy attorney general for 11 years, in evaluating his fitness to be a judge. Colleagues described him as \u201cgratuitously rude,\u201d per the ABA report, and said they had an \u201cunusual fear\u201d of consequences if they said anything negative about him because of his \u201cdeep connection\u201d to powerful politicians in Nebraska.\nABA members also raised concerns that Grasz would be \u201cunable to separate his role as an advocate from that of a judge,\u201d given his record on issues like LGBTQ and abortion rights. Among other things, Grasz served on a nonprofit board that backed so-called conversion therapy for LGBTQ kids, and in a 1999 article argued that lower courts should be able to overrule Supreme Court decisions on abortion rights because \u201cabortion jurisprudence is, to a significant extent, a word game.\u201d\n\u201cIn sum, the evaluators and the Committee found that temperament issues, particularly bias and lack of open-mindedness, were problematic,\u201d reads\u00a0a statement\u00a0by Pam Bresnahan, the chair of the ABA\u2019s standing committee that reviews nominees. \u201cThe evaluators found that the people interviewed believed that the nominee\u2019s bias and the lens through which he viewed his role as a judge colored his ability to judge fairly.\u201d\nGrasz is one of four Trump judicial nominees to get a\u00a0\u201cnot qualified\u201d ABA rating, unanimous or otherwise. Others include district court nominees\u00a0Brett Talley,\u00a0who has never tried a case and didn\u2019t tell the Senate that his wife is chief of staff to White House counsel Don McGahn;\u00a0Charles Goodwin, who raised questions about his ability to fulfill the demands of a federal judge; and Holly Teeter, who lacks trial court experience.\nGrasz is the first of the bunch to get confirmed. He endured a humiliating confirmation hearing, as Democrats pressed him on his awful ABA rating.\nPart of the problem here is that Trump is flying through judicial nominations without much vetting, and he\u2019s not\u00a0submitting his potential court picks to the ABA before he announces their nominations.\u00a0Most presidents have waited for the ABA rating to come out before officially announcing a nominee, in part to save face in the event one of their nominees gets a particularly bad rating. Former President Barack Obama, for example,\u00a0didn\u2019t nominate any of his potential court picks who got an unqualified ABA rating.\n\u201cNo president has so quickly nominated so many troubling nominees,\u201d said Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond law professor and expert on judicial nominations. \u201cBad process can make for bad judges, and these are life-tenured posts.\u201d\nRepublicans had not raised many concerns with Trump\u2019s unqualified nominees until Tuesday, when Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Judiciary Committee,\u00a0unexpectedly said\u00a0he thinks Trump should withdraw Talley and another district court nominee, Jeff Mateer, who has\u00a0described transgender children\u00a0as evidence of \u201cSatan\u2019s plan.\u201d\nProgressive judicial advocacy groups hailed Grassley\u2019s comments as a sign that Republicans may stop being a rubber stamp for Trump\u2019s questionable court nominees.\n\u201cWe believe this is an opportunity for a real turning point,\u201d said Nan Aron, president of Alliance for Justice, \u201cif the White House uses this moment to reassess its criteria for judicial nominations and to put forward nominees who will be serious about upholding critical legal rights and protections for all.\u201d\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders had no response to Grassley\u2019s request at her daily press briefing.", "date": "\n12/12/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/senate-confirms-leonard-steven-grasz_n_5a2ffeefe4b01598ac486379", "tags": "grasz judicial rated qualified confirms judge court rating \u201d federal aba senate nominees serve"}
