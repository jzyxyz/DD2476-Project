{"title": "As Amazon\u2019s Influence Grows, Marketers Scramble to Tailor Strategies", "content": "Amazon\u2019s rapidly expanding influence on a wide portion of the American public has become impossible to ignore \u2014 and it is giving rise to a whole new side of the advertising industry.\nAs more people live large portions of their lives in Amazon\u2019s ecosystem, ad agencies are increasingly offering specialized services to help brands take full advantage of the company\u2019s universe.\nThat means adding flourishes like recipes and magazine-style images to product pages, coming up with creative ways to get customers to post reviews on Amazon and plotting how companies can best connect with people who are using devices like the voice-activated Echo.\nAnd Amazon itself, aware of its growing power, is encouraging companies to buy more ads through its own media group. Its argument: When an ad is on Amazon, a direct connection can be made between people seeing it and then making a purchase.\n\u201cHow your product is perceived on Amazon and in the Amazon community in ratings and reviews has such a powerful impact on the future of you as a brand,\u201d said John Denny, vice president for digital and e-commerce at Bai Brands, the beverage company. \u201cIncreasingly, if you win on Amazon, you win, period. And this is the world marketers have to wrap their brains around.\u201d\nSeveral advertising executives anticipate that more agencies will begin offering Amazon-focused services, comparing the company\u2019s rise to previous paradigm shifts like when search engines and social media became a daily part of people\u2019s lives.\nIt\u2019s already affecting what shoppers see. Take, for example, the Amazon product page for a whey protein powder from Optimum Nutrition. It was put together with help from the Tombras Group, based in Knoxville, Tenn., which recently started an Amazon-focused division.\nDooley Tombras, the firm\u2019s executive vice president, said it sent products to influential Amazon reviewers in hopes of soliciting positive feedback and conducted \u201cguerrilla sampling,\u201d like holding events \u201cwhere we\u2019re handing out a product and we\u2019ve got teams there with iPads and we\u2019re encouraging people to write reviews of a product on the spot.\u201d\nThere are more than 14,000 reviews of the powder. The page also has more than a dozen images of the powder taken from \u201cmultiple angles\u201d against a light background to look clean and professional, Mr. Tombras said, along with short videos extolling the powder.\nBrands can pay Amazon to customize the middle of pages with large advertorial images and information \u2014 which in the protein powder\u2019s case included photos of men working out; a recipe for \u201cbirthday cake pancakes\u201d made with the chocolate-flavored whey; and a chart featuring six of its other products, like Micronized Creatine Powder, explaining when and how they should be consumed.\nMr. Tombras\u2019s firm is even working on a feature for Echo devices that will provide recipes from Optimum Nutrition. \u201cIf you find a recipe you like and happen to not have that flavor or item, you can go ahead and make that purchase,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich is pretty cool.\u201d\nAmazon has long been an online shopping behemoth, but marketers now know it is playing an increasingly important role in how people discover and learn about their goods.\n\u201cE-commerce is nothing new, it\u2019s been going on for decades, and Amazon is nothing new, it\u2019s been successful for decades \u2014 but now they are becoming much more of a dominant force in brand discovery,\u201d said Sarah Hofstetter, the chief executive of the digital agency 360i.\nIts quick success in categories like apparel and the popularity of voice search emphasized that, Ms. Hofstetter said. \u201cAmazon is the new shelf space,\u201d she added, \u201cand if you\u2019re not on it, you may be rendered invisible.\u201d\nMindshare and Possible, two agencies under the ad giant WPP, recently announced a service to help companies spend their advertising dollars across \u201cthe Amazon ecosystem.\u201d (Possible caught the industry\u2019s attention this year when it acquired Marketplace Ignition, an Amazon-focused consulting firm.)\nThe agencies said in the release that more than half of United States consumers now started online product searches on Amazon, compared with 28 percent on search engines and 16 percent on retailer websites.\nMartin Sorrell, WPP\u2019s chief executive, said on an earnings call this year that \u201cAmazon\u2019s penetration in most areas is frightening to some.\u201d He added that the company was his response when people asked him, \u201cWhat worries you when you get up at night and when you wake up in the morning?\u201d\nIn an interview in Cannes, France, last month, Mr. Sorrell said his firm wanted to do more with clients and Amazon, but noted there were major questions around how brands might gain access its customer data and compete on voice search.\n\u201cWhat happens if I say to Alexa, \u2018I like Cheerios,\u2019 and Alexa says, \u2018I\u2019ve got Kellogg\u2019s Corn Flakes, which are 10 percent off\u2019?\u201d he said.\nAmazon Media Group, the company\u2019s growing advertising division, has been looking to assuage such concerns while touting new ways marketers can reach people on Amazon. Seth Dallaire, its head of global ad sales and marketing, has been urging agencies to view product pages and images as \u201cbrand marketing vehicles,\u201d noting that if they are not well maintained it could undermine all the work companies did to get people there in the first place.\n\u201cWe can see the entire customer-decision journey, and that\u2019s what\u2019s unique,\u201d Mr. Dallaire said. \u201cWe can help a brand if they\u2019re selling their products on Amazon understand when a customer is exposed to an ad and, when they clicked on an ad, if they bought something, and then we can help them tailor their marketing messages and their creative to each different step.\u201d\nThat\u2019s no small pitch given the guesswork that goes into advertising. Amazon has long sold lucrative sponsored product listings and other ads tied to search terms on its site, like Google. It also offers automatically placed ads on external sites using its own technology and data, and marketing on Amazon packages and devices like Kindles.\nIt can harness its users, too \u2014 while Amazon does not sell cars, it worked with Hyundai last year to offer test drives to Prime Now customers in California.\nAmazon does not disclose the size of its ad business, though estimates show it is well below Google and Facebook, which each bring in more than $25 billion from ads annually. While eMarketer estimated that Amazon will attract more than $1 billion in ad revenue this year, BMO Capital Markets forecasts $3.5 billion for 2017 and $5.7 billion next year.\n\u201cIn the grand scheme of things, the advertising revenue they\u2019re generating is small compared to Google \u2014 you can barely compare them,\u201d said Norm Johnston, global chief strategy and digital officer for Mindshare. \u201cBut for Amazon, it\u2019s not the advertising revenue in itself. They know if brands invest in the platform, the more sales they\u2019re going to generate, and a lot of those sales lead to subscription models.\u201d\nIn the past, many brands handled their Amazon business through store sales teams that determined shelf positioning and end-of-aisle displays at brick-and-mortar chains. That is no longer workable as Amazon extends its ad network, offering branding opportunities through its Prime program and streaming N.F.L. games.\n\u201cIn the old world, you\u2019d run magazines, TV spots and outdoor ads, then you\u2019d go into the shop, and they\u2019d control what happened in the shop,\u201d Mr. Johnston said. \u201cYou can\u2019t distinguish like that anymore.\u201d\nTo that end, marketers are also learning to pay new attention to issues like how much of an item is in stock before promoting it, or risk being penalized by Amazon\u2019s algorithms if they aren\u2019t able to handle demand, Mr. Denny of Bai said.\nMr. Dallaire said Amazon planned to keep investing in its ad sales and agency development teams.\nUltimately, he said, the interest is generated by behavioral shifts.\n\u201cIt could be people shopping on their phones, the expectation you or I might have of getting immediate customer-review information and pricing information within seconds of pulling a device out of our pockets, it could be the expectation of hearing a song you ask Alexa to play,\u201d he said. \u201cAdvertisers want to make sure they are not missing out on these customer trends.\u201d", "date": "July 31, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/31/business/media/amazon-advertising.html", "tags": "ad scramble advertising grows product \u201d tailor influence strategies like amazon marketers"}
