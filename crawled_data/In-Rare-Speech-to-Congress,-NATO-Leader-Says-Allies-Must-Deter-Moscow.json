{"title": "In Rare Speech to Congress, NATO Leader Says Allies Must Deter Moscow", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The NATO secretary general gave a strong defense of the 70-year-old military alliance between Europe and the United States, using a high-profile appearance before a joint session of Congress on Wednesday to urge allies to stand up to a more assertive Russia.\nWhile the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is not looking for a new Cold War with Moscow, the alliance\u2019s leader, Jens Stoltenberg, said it was important to not be \u201cna\u00efve\u201d about the Kremlin\u2019s intentions. Proffering a long list of Russian actions that threaten NATO allies, including the annexation of Crimea, the use of a nerve agent in Britain and Moscow\u2019s interference in democratic elections, Mr. Stoltenberg cited \u201ca pattern of Russian behavior\u201d that calls for the alliance to be more united than ever in its response.\n\u201cNATO will always take the necessary steps to provide credible and effective deterrence,\u201d Mr. Stoltenberg said at the Capitol. He was in Washington for a meeting of foreign ministers from NATO member states.\nBut his remarks came in the middle of a poorly timed squabble between two of the alliance\u2019s fractious members \u2014 the United States and Turkey \u2014 with Russia as the potential beneficiary. Earlier this week, the Pentagon announced that it was halting the delivery of parts for F-35 fighter jets to Turkey because Ankara is pursuing plans to buy S-400 missile defense systems from Russia.\nAmerican officials do not want Turkey to purchase the Russian system and have warned that it could collect information on United States stealth fighter jets.\nThe Turkish foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, was adamant in a separate alliance event in Washington on Wednesday that Ankara will not budge. \u201cIt\u2019s a done deal,\u201d he said. \u201cTurkey doesn\u2019t have to choose between Russia and any others, and we don\u2019t see our relationship with Russia as an alternative to others.\u201d\nBut the Trump administration, so far, is being equally adamant.\n\u201cTurkey must choose,\u201d Vice President Mike Pence said at a NATO anniversary event. \u201cDoes it want to remain a critical partner in the most successful military alliance in history, or does it want to risk the security of that partnership by making such reckless decisions that undermine our alliance?\u201d\nMr. Stoltenberg, in his speech before Congress, did not directly reference the F-35 squabble. But he characterized fights among alliance partners as \u201cdemocracy.\u201d\n\u201cOpen discussions and different views is not a sign of weakness,\u201d Mr. Stoltenberg said. \u201cIt is a sign of strength.\u201d\nHe also reaffirmed NATO\u2019s core mandate of collective defense \u2014 that an attack on one member state is viewed as an attack on all 29. But in doing so, Mr. Stoltenberg aired a principle that President Trump has questioned, exposing the new rift that has developed between his administration and the United States\u2019 most important allies.\nWednesday\u2019s speech was the first time that a secretary general of the alliance has been invited to speak on Congress\u2019s most high-profile stage, and the platform afforded to Mr. Stoltenberg was in many ways a sign of lawmakers\u2019 concerns over Mr. Trump\u2019s commitment to NATO.\nMr. Stoltenberg, a careful diplomat, made no criticism of Mr. Trump, and instead credited the president with prodding the alliance to spend more on defense. Still, the overall theme of Mr. Stoltenberg\u2019s speech was to make the case for NATO, the value of which Mr. Trump has often questioned.\nLawmakers gave Mr. Stoltenberg a series of standing ovations. Legislation that has bipartisan support is making its way through Congress, and would explicitly prohibit any president from withdrawing the United States from the alliance without Senate approval.\nIn his speech, which was peppered with political and personal details, Mr. Stoltenberg said the military alliance has been good not just for Europe, but for the United States as well. He reminded lawmakers that the only time NATO has invoked Article 5 \u2014 the pact of collective defense following attacks \u2014 was after the terrorist strikes against the United States on Sept. 11, 2001.\n\u201cThe strength of a nation,\u201d Mr. Stoltenberg said, \u201cis not only measured by the size of its economy or the number of its soldiers, but also by the number of its friends.\u201d\n\u201cAnd through NATO, the United States has more friends and allies than any other power,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has made the United States stronger, safer and more secure.\u201d", "date": "April 3, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/03/us/politics/nato-congress-russia-.html", "tags": "allies deter speech united nato alliance rare \u201d states must says moscow leader stoltenberg \u2014 congress"}
