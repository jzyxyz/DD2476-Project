{"title": "A Night at the Coup", "content": "Istanbul \u2014 AS I walked by the military museum in the Harbiye neighborhood of Istanbul on Friday evening, I was expecting a silent end to a busy week. I was on my way to an adjoining coffee shop where I planned to drink a cup of hot cocoa and read a literary magazine. The museum was eerily silent, but I didn\u2019t think much of it, passing the human-sized mannequins of Ottoman-era janissary soldiers displayed in the windows.\nIt was after 10 p.m. In the coffee shop someone said that, shortly before, soldiers had closed public access to the Bosporus and Fatih Sultan Mehmet bridges, which connect Istanbul\u2019s European and Asian sides. I didn\u2019t think much of that either, linking the news to anxiety about another terrorist attack. The soldiers were probably just there to protect the city\u2019s residents.\nIt was only when I saw, on my phone, videos of fights between police officers and soldiers near the president\u2019s offices that I thought: military coup. I asked the waiter to put my cocoa in a paper cup and headed for Gezi Park, the center of major protests in the summer of 2013. But last night it was breezy and silent, filled with silhouettes of other night-strollers. The park seemed oblivious to politics.\nI walked to Cihangir, the bobo neighborhood where I live, and met some friends on side streets who were half-drunkenly discussing the difference between a \u201cdarbe\u201d (a coup) and a \u201cderbi\u201d (a local soccer competition). \u201cDarbe is like this super-total military control,\u201d said one who had never experienced a coup.\nMy cleaning lady called to ask when things would \u201creturn to normal.\u201d I told her, \u201cSabah ola hayrola,\u201d a Turkish expression that advises waiting until the morning, after things have settled down. Then a friend called to tell me I should stock up on supplies, especially pasta, water and bread. \u201cThe market is still open,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThis may be last your chance. Go there now.\u201d\nThe supermarket nearby was packed with hipsters who alternated between checking their smartphones and checking out one another, tattooed arms leaden with groceries. I ran into a friend who was talking on the phone to a mother full of wisdom acquired during the 1980 coup. It was the same advice: Buy pasta, water and bread.\nI brought plenty of that back to my apartment. Amira, a curator friend who works in a contemporary art gallery nearby, sought refuge there: Cabs weren\u2019t taking passengers, she said; she couldn\u2019t get back home, in the Anatolian part of the city. We started watching the street through the window. Five minutes later, about 50 youths started running in panic, looking over their shoulders, jumping into open-air cafes. What was going on? I was reminded of the mayhem in Nice, France, the day before.\nIn the living room, we watched as someone on CNN Turk used FaceTime to interview President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and former president Abdullah Gul. They seemed angry, and yet somehow managed to speak calmly. Mr. Erdogan was scheduled to arrive at Istanbul\u2019s Ataturk Airport, the site of a terrorist attack last month. The pundits on CNN Turk were saying that all would be fine, that things were returning to normal.\nIt was only when Amira and I opened a bottle of white wine to calm ourselves down that the most spectacular events of the evening happened. Military helicopters started bombing Parliament in Ankara while CNN Turk was broadcasting footage of parliamentarians inside. One member of Parliament could be seen pointing her iPhone at the destroyed corners of the building. Then soldiers barged into CNN Turk\u2019s headquarters, made an on-air appearance in the studio and cut off the broadcast.\nMeanwhile, Cihangir remained deserted, except for the flickering iPad screens I could see from my window in other apartments. The neighborhood was silent, like a classroom of students after the headmaster walks in.\nAccording to Facebook, though, people in Tophane, a neighborhood nearby, were marching toward the Bosporus Bridge or taking their cars and heading to the airport. Turkey\u2019s General Directorate of Security had taken to Twitter urging the city\u2019s residents to hit the streets and fill the squares \u2014 an extraordinary request coming from cops.\nThen it was Mr. Erdogan who sent his own text messages to millions of Turks, calling on them to rally and march. \u201cOur nation hunted coup plotters instead of Pokemons last night,\u201d one journalist tweeted. \u201cThis is how the Turkish nation is.\u201d\nNot knowing what else to do, I went to bed. It was already time for the morning prayer from the Cihangir mosque. The imam was asking the people to stand with the government. I heard the sound of jets again. Then there was silence, and I fell asleep.\nWhen I woke up, around 7 a.m., birds were chirping in the trees. Just half a day after I\u2019d first heard news of the coup attempt, I went for a walk by the Bosporus Strait, magazine in hand, and joined sandal-wearing Istanbul residents who were talking about the events of the night before \u2014 events that killed hundreds of people \u2014 as if they\u2019d only been part of a TV show. In the background was the waterway, a burning sun and two bridges that span two continents, where just hours before tanks had been firing shots.", "date": "July 16, 2016", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/16/opinion/a-night-at-the-coup.html", "tags": "soldiers military istanbul neighborhood silent \u201d night last coup \u2014"}
