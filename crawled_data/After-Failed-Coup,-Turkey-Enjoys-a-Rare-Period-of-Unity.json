{"title": "After Failed Coup, Turkey Enjoys a Rare Period of Unity", "content": "ISTANBUL \u2014 President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey is normally a divisive figure, loved by his base of religious conservatives and loathed by the rest of society. But there he was recently, sipping tea and making easy chitchat with his political rivals, just before joining them in a rally this month on Istanbul\u2019s waterfront to celebrate the failure of an attempted military coup.\nAn odd thing has happened in Turkey. Usually deeply polarized, the two sides are largely united in their opposition to military coups and the movement of Fethullah Gulen, a Muslim cleric who lives in self-exile in Pennsylvania and has been accused by Turkey of orchestrating the failed uprising.\nThe unity was on vivid display at the rally, a sea of red-and-white Turkish flags where at least two million Turks put aside their political differences to express solidarity.\n\u201cThis is the first political rally I\u2019ve attended with members of my extended family who have different political views,\u201d said Huseyin Acikkaya, a parking lot attendant. His in-laws stopped speaking to him after he voted for Mr. Erdogan\u2019s party last year, he said, but all that was forgotten after the coup attempt.\n\u201cWe came together to save our nation from outside forces, so we are here for the love of our country and flag,\u201d he said.\nMr. Erdogan, an Islamist who has run the country for more than a decade, has unabashedly used the aftermath of the mid-July coup to focus the country on a common enemy. His approval rating has shot up to 68 percent, from 47 percent before the failed coup. He has not only toned down his divisive language but also said he would rescind the numerous criminal cases he has pursued against Turks for insulting him, a crime under Turkish law.\nThat has been accompanied by a sweeping purge of suspected followers of Mr. Gulen from the state bureaucracy and other professions. Tens of thousands of people have lost their jobs, raising concerns among Western allies that a witch-hunt mentality has gripped Turkey and that Mr. Erdogan is moving further down the path of authoritarianism.\nBut in Turkey, the purges are seen differently by society at large and are one more point to rally around, even for those who have been critical of Mr. Erdogan.\nWhile the liberals may worry that Mr. Erdogan will go after them once he is done with the Gulenists, and are mindful that Mr. Erdogan and Mr. Gulen were once allies, they are largely supportive of the mass dismissals and arrests.\nSecular and liberal Turks have long been suspicious of Gulenists inside the state bureaucracy, seeing them as enemies of the old secular elite. The Gulenists were also known to oppose efforts by Mr. Erdogan to seek peace with Kurdish militants.\n\u201cI\u2019m against purges; I\u2019m against witch hunts,\u201d said Akin Unver, a professor of international relations at Kadir Has University in Istanbul. Nevertheless, he said, \u201cthe Gulenists ended up annoying everyone here over the last 10 years. That\u2019s why people are very calm about it.\u201d\nIn Washington on Tuesday, Mark C. Toner, a State Department spokesman, confirmed that Turkey had \u201crequested the extradition of Mr. Gulen.\u201d He added, however, that the request \u201cdid not relate\u201d to the attempted coup.\nMr. Toner said that while he did not have any further information on the request itself, \u201cmy understanding is that we were now in the stage where we are considering the merits of the request.\u201d\nThe extradition proceedings will be on the agenda when Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. meets with Mr. Erdogan and Prime Minister Binali Yildirim in Ankara, the capital, on Wednesday.\nWhile some Turks left the recent rally hopeful that the unity would carry into the political arena and result in greater democracy, there are widespread suspicions that Mr. Erdogan, who has long been criticized for his increasingly autocratic bent, will use the rally-around-the-flag moment to consolidate his grip on the state.\n\u201cErdogan wants the support of the main opposition C.H.P., and he has reached that in terms of creating an atmosphere that would give his supporters the impression that \u2018our chief pulled them to his side,\u2019 \u201d said Aydin Engin, a Turkish intellectual, using the initials of the Turkish name of the country\u2019s main secular party, the Republican People\u2019s Party. \u201cBut I believe he is determined to continue with his own agenda.\u201d\nMany of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s opponents also fear that once the dust settles, Turkish politics will sink back into their default position of \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem.\u201d\n\u201cMany of the political problems dividing the country before the coup are still present,\u201d said Simon Waldman, a political sociologist and lecturer in Middle Eastern studies at King\u2019s College London. \u201cIt is easier to be united against something such as a coup, which would have benefited very few people in Turkey, than being united in a shared political vision of the future.\u201d\nAnalysts also say that public displays of unity stem in part from fears that those who do not partake will be branded coup plotters or Gulenists. After all, Mr. Erdogan has asked Turks to inform on those they believe are connected to Mr. Gulen, adding to the witch-hunt environment in Turkey as the government continues its crackdown.\n\u201cOnce the opposition parties break free from this paralyzing fear, they can begin to expose how the ruling party, behind a facade of consensus, dictates policies without feeling the need to consult them, or any other stakeholder for that matter,\u201d said Aykan Erdemir, a former member of the Turkish Parliament who is now a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\nHe added, \u201cErdogan will strengthen his one-man rule and bring the country a step closer to a one-party state.\u201d\nThe pro-Kurdish People\u2019s Democratic Party, the country\u2019s third-biggest political group, was not invited to the rally, and it has not been part of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s fence mending because of its supposed links to Kurdish militants. Members of the party fear that its exclusion from rallies and other peaceful political events will further disenfranchise Kurds and push them toward the extremist Kurdish cause.\nBefore the coup attempt, a string of terrorist attacks by Kurdish and Islamic State militants had demoralized the public. But now, despite a suicide bombing at a wedding on Saturday in southern Turkey, people have heeded Mr. Erdogan\u2019s call to go to public squares and \u201cdefend democracy.\u201d\n\u201cWe survived a coup,\u201d Engin Firat, a cafe worker, shouted at the rally. \u201cWe are the soldiers and guardians of this nation now. We are stronger than the leaders, politicians and terrorists. We have shown strength as the people, and because of that, there is hope.\u201d", "date": "Aug. 23, 2016", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/24/world/europe/after-failed-coup-turkey-settles-into-a-rare-period-of-unity.html", "tags": "turkey enjoys country unity rare failed \u201d political rally period coup erdogan"}
