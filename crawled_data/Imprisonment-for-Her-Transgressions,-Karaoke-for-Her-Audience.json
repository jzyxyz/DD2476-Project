{"title": "Imprisonment for Her Transgressions, Karaoke for Her Audience", "content": "\u201cWhy are you in there?\u201d a visitor asked the woman behind bars. \nThe woman was the performance artist Ann Liv Young, and she was all dolled up in a free-standing jail cell at Jack, a performance space in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn. At the invitation of Jack\u2019s artistic director, Alec Duffy, Ms. Young was doing time for her transgressions.\nIt\u2019s been almost a year since Ms. Young \u2014 masquerading as her alter ego, the tough-love therapist Sherry \u2014 flagrantly disrupted another artist\u2019s show at American Realness, the annual festival of contemporary performance at Abrons Arts Center. That show, Rebecca Patek\u2019s \u201cIneter(a)nal F/ear,\u201d dealt subversively with issues of rape and other kinds of trauma, a disquieting blur of sincerity and satire. Sherry (Ms. Young insists she acted in character) didn\u2019t like it and objected with a barrage of verbal assaults, some delivered via megaphone.\nPeople were angry; Ms. Young was banned from Abrons. \u201cEvery curator, institution and artist who aligns themselves with Ms. Young is complicit in her violence,\u201d the critic Andy Horwitz wrote. Ms. Patek published an incisive response. So when Mr. Duffy wanted to present Ms. Young, he couldn\u2019t ignore \u201cthe hubbub,\u201d he explained during Thursday\u2019s performance. \u201cThe idea,\u201d he said, addressing Ms. Young, \u201cwas to punish you.\u201d\nBut \u201cAnn Liv Young in Jail\u201d was hardly punishment. A chance to put on a show \u2014 and to rehearse and advertise her other new production, \u201cElektra\u201d \u2014 it was more like a gift to the artist and her posse of (noncaged) assistants, more party than penance. \n\u201cI don\u2019t really feel like I should be in jail,\u201d Ms. Young said, \u201cbecause I don\u2019t feel like I did anything wrong.\u201d From her comfortable confines \u2014 equipped with laptop, water, food, deodorant, books and a trash can where, in keeping with her oeuvre, she publicly relieved herself \u2014 she orchestrated four hours of karaoke, confession, participatory aerobics and other forms of release.\nThursday\u2019s audience, made up mostly of inquisitive theater students from New York University, was particularly game for Ms. Young\u2019s interactive, improvisatory mandates. Though she began as \u201cherself,\u201d she soon slipped into Sherry mode, practicing her caustic, cut-to-the-chase brand of psychiatry, Sherapy, what one viewer aptly, almost gleefully called a terrifying method of interrogation. \nVisitors could come and go, but most of us stayed until the end. Even as I oscillated between delight and trepidation, fascination and boredom, I didn\u2019t want to leave. The whole thing seemed brilliant one moment, perverse the next: to capitalize on one\u2019s own offense, to critique the state of performance by performing mostly for other performers in a room inside a room. Maybe there are less insular conversations to be had.", "date": "Dec. 7, 2014", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/08/arts/dance/ann-liv-young-in-jail-for-crimes-against-performance.html", "tags": "transgressions like young sherry audience artist jail \u201d performance imprisonment ms. karaoke \u2014"}
