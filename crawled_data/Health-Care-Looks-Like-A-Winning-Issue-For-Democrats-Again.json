{"title": "Health Care Looks Like A Winning Issue For Democrats Again", "content": "Seven years ago, the unpopularity of the Affordable Care Act helped doom Democrats to a historic midterm drubbing. Like much of the political landscape pre-Donald Trump, that now feels like ancient history.\nBack then, the nation\u2019s opinions of the bill were deep underwater. But after Trump\u2019s election as president and a subsequent brush with repeal, the Democrats\u2019 health care law has emerged, for the first time, as a political asset. On average, Americans\u2019 support for the law now outstrips opposition by nearly 8 points, according to HuffPost Pollster\u2019s aggregate.\nWhile the GOP has never polled especially well on health care, they\u2019re currently running an 18-point deficit on the issue, per Pew Research tracking, up from 7 points in 2010. It\u2019s Trump\u2019s worst issue, according to surveys.\u00a0A recent release from ABC and The Washington Post\u00a0found barely over a quarter of respondents impressed with his handling of the health care system, thanks to a combination of universal antipathy from Democrats and relatively tepid support among Republicans. Trump\u2019s score on the economy was 18 points higher.\nNow that the country is in a period of robust growth, health care has toppled the economy from its usual perch as the nation\u2019s top concern. Democratic voters in particular cite health care as the issue most important to them.\nFollowing the attempt at repeal, Democrats, realizing the reforms they\u2019d achieved were subject to reversal, \u201crallied around the ACA in a way that they hadn\u2019t before,\u201d said Mollyann Brodie, executive director for public opinion and survey research at the Kaiser Family Foundation. For the party, she said, \u201cit\u2019s an issue that you don\u2019t have to hide from anymore.\u201d \n\u201cHealth care is as divisive an issue as it\u2019s ever been \u2015 that hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d Brodie said. \u201cWhat the threats against the ACA show Democrats is that the gains that they\u2019ve made on health care could go away. It makes it an issue that Democratic candidates can embrace as they\u2019re trying to rally their base to turn out. But I wouldn\u2019t expect the Republicans to shy away from it either.\u201d\nVoters aren\u2019t always reliable narrators of how they made their decisions, but exit polling from Virginia\u2019s gubernatorial race at least suggests that the issue was a rallying point for many Democrats on Tuesday. In that race, a 39 percent plurality of voters told exit pollsters that health care was their top issue. Among that bloc, Northam won more than three-quarters of the votes. (In Virginia\u2019s gubernatorial election of 2013, just 27 percent of voters\u00a0picked health care\u00a0as their top issue, with those who did almost evenly split between the Democratic and Republican contenders.)\nFox News, which conducted separate election polling of the state, found health care close to tied with the economy in importance, but also highlighted Virginia\u2019s support for the Affordable Care Act. Fifty-eight percent of those polled said the law either was about right or didn\u2019t go far enough; those voters went for Northam by a wide margin.\n\u201cHealth care was central to our campaign,\u201d Northam\u2019s pollster, Geoff Garin, told HuffPost. \u201cThe best known fact about either candidate was that Ralph is a doctor. Even in our negative ads, the disclaimer showed Ralph as a pediatrician... In our ads criticizing [Republican nominee Ed] Gillespie for lobbying for the Trump agenda, health care was one of the prime examples we used.\u201d \nFurther north, residents of Maine voted overwhelmingly to expand Medicaid in the state, in the face of national efforts to scale the program.\nHealth care, of course, wasn\u2019t directly on the ballot in most races. And it\u2019s certainly not the only thing lifting Democrats, whose success Tuesday seemed buoyed by a hostility toward Trump that transcends any one issue, not to mention their structural advantage as the opposition party.\nIt\u2019s also unclear what role health care will play in the national debate a year from now. The bill\u2019s failure likely blunted the edge of what might have been a reckoning for Republicans along the lines of what Democrats faced in 2010 after the passage of the Affordable Care Act. But Democrats, who once\u00a0ducked discussion of the issue, now seem more than happy to let it take center stage.", "date": "\n11/10/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/health-care-democrats-polls_n_5a05fecae4b0e37d2f375d36?ifb", "tags": "winning \u201c democrats issue looks voters affordable like care health"}
