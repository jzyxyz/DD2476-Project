Spoilers below for \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d Season 7!\nThe seventh season of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d ended with a ... well, you know.\u00a0\nAfter seven episodes of hard-core shipping, fans got what they wanted\u00a0(or maybe they didn\u2019t want it?)\u00a0as Jon Snow (Kit Harington) and Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) made sweet, sweet love on their boat ride to the North. We all knew that hand-holding was leading somewhere, right?\u00a0\nBut, the lovebirds shouldn\u2019t get too cozy. As we also learned in the episode, Bran (Isaac Hempstead-Wright) and Sam (John Bradley) both know Jon\u2019s true parentage and plan to tell him when he arrives back in Winterfell.\u00a0\nDuring a flashback scene, we see the wedding of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark, which proves Jon is not a bastard but the rightful heir to the Iron Throne. His real name is Aegon Targaryen.\nHe\u2019s also Dany\u2019s nephew, so that could mess things up a bit. Will she be OK with him superseding her supposed seat in King\u2019s Landing? More importantly, will she be be OK knowing she did stuff\u00a0with her nephew??\nWe know incest isn\u2019t a problem for Jaime (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) and Cersei (Lena Headey) Lannister, but something tells us Jon Aegon won\u2019t be as into it.\u00a0Still, House Targaryen has always embraced family love, as George R.R. Martin described in an interview with 92Y in 2014.\u00a0\nYup, he said nephews and aunts. So, we\u2019re done here.\nIf Jon (yeah, Aegon just doesn\u2019t feel right yet) truly loves Dany, he will embrace the Targaryen way of life and marry her \u2015 hopefully creating dragon-loving Stark babies down the line. Although Dany believes she can no longer have children \u2015 thanks to the witch Mirri Maz Duur from Season 1 \u2015 there\u2019s evidence the curse may have been lifted after the death of her dragon child, Viserion.\u00a0\nAs Mirri Maz Duur tells her:\u00a0\u201cOnly death can pay for life.\u201d\u00a0\nHere\u2019s to the Dragon and the Wolf, and their\u00a0(hopefully) long and prosperous future together.\u00a0", "date": "\n08/27/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jon-and-daenerys-made-their-love-official-on-game-of-thrones-season-7-finale_n_599ed2fbe4b05710aa5a409e", "tags": "game know finale targaryen thrones season \u201d official \u2015 jon love aegon made dany daenerys"}
