{"title": "'Game Of Thrones' Premiere Confirms Huge Rumors About Season 7", "content": "\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d Season 6 ended over a year ago, and we\u2019ve been waiting for new episodes ever since.\nWe watched blocks of ice melt to learn the premiere date (during a Facebook Live stream which cut out multiple times), but now that\u2019s all in the past.\u00a0Season 7 has arrived.\u00a0Winter is here.\nThere were plenty of surprising scenes during the first episode (uh, Ed Sheeran showing up out of nowhere to debut some hot new tracks comes to mind), but nothing topped the opening.\u00a0\nFor a while now there\u2019s been a rumor that Arya (Maisie Williams) wasn\u2019t done avenging the Red Wedding. Though the young assassin killed Walder Frey (David Bradley) and his sons in the Season 6 finale, the word was she would don Walder\u2019s face in Season 7 and finish off the other Freys.\nThat\u2019s exactly what happened, and people lost it.\nIn the opening moments of the episode, Arya Stark shows up at a banquet wearing Walder Frey\u2019s face. Then, she makes an epic speech while poisoning the rest of the Frey men, saying lines like, \u201cWhen you leave one wolf alive, the sheep are never safe,\u201d and, \u201cThe North remembers.\u201d\nIt was very baller. Arya is very baller.\u00a0\nHere are the other big moments from the premiere ...\nRemember Euron Greyjoy (Pilou Asb\u00e6k)?\nHe showed up in Season 6, killed Balon Greyjoy (Patrick Malahide) and ended up becoming the leader of the Ironborn.\u00a0\nWell, now he\u2019s back and asking Cersei (Lena Headey) for her hand in marriage, confirming the rumor that he\u2019d be teaming up with the Lannisters.\nWill he marry Cersei? Meh, who knows? He promised her a gift, though, so this is to be continued.\nIt\u2019s a Bran-new day for the youngest Stark left alive.\nBran (Isaac Hempstead Wright) finally makes it to the Wall in the Season 7 premiere and convinces the Night\u2019s Watch to let him pass.\u00a0\nWhy is this a big moment?\nRemember that Bran was marked by the Night\u2019s King in Season 6 of the show. This allowed the Night\u2019s King to get past the magical protections on the Three-Eyed Raven\u2019s cave, and many theorize that when Bran crosses the Wall, it\u2019ll take magical protections off that, too.\nOK, what the hell is going on here?\u00a0\nEd Sheeran shows up in what looks like Lannister gear, sings a song, and Arya\u2019s all like, \u201cYo, that was dope.\u201d\u00a0\nWhatever.\nArya saves the rando moment by saying she\u2019s headed to King\u2019s Landing to kill the queen. Everyone has a good laugh.\nIf the scene continued, we\u2019re 100 percent sure Sheeran would start singing about a castle on the hill.\u00a0\nBeric Dondarrion (Richard Dormer) and Thoros of Myr (Paul Kaye) show the Hound (Rory McCann) exactly why the Lord of Light chose them. While looking into the flames of a fire \u2015 at the home of a family he seemingly robbed before\u00a0\u2015 the Hound sees a vision, including \u201ca mountain, it looks like an arrowhead, the dead are walking past.\u201d\u00a0\nFulfilling yet another rumor, Sam Tarly (John Bradley) comes across Jorah Mormont (Iain Glen) apparently in a cell in Oldtown. You pretty much just see his arm, but Jorah\u2019s looking pretty rough thanks to that Greyscale. We\u2019ll see if Sam ends up helping him.\nOther than that, Sam\u2019s having a pretty crappy time at the Citadel, literally cleaning up crap. But then, Sam goes all Harry Potter and steals keys to sneak into the restricted section of the library. There, he discovers there\u2019s a bunch of dragonglass under Dragonstone.\u00a0\nThat could be pretty useful when it comes to taking on the White Walkers.\nDany (Emilia Clarke) has arrived!\nThe Mother of Dragons finally makes it to Westeros and arrives at the Targaryen ancestral home of Dragonstone. There\u2019s not a whole lot that happens here except Dany\u2019s all like, \u201cShall we begin?\u201d\n(She means shall we begin taking over the world, basically.)\nWinter is here, and so are giants in the White Walker army. They\u2019re not at the Wall yet, but the scene just serves as a reminder that shiz is going down and Season 7 is on!", "date": "\n07/16/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/game-of-thrones-premiere-confirms-huge-rumors-about-season-7_n_596928c6e4b01741862779cd", "tags": "premiere confirms season sam sheeran \u201d arya rumors pretty comes thrones like huge"}
