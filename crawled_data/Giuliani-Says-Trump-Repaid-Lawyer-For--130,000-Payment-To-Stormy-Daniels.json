{"title": "Giuliani Says Trump Repaid Lawyer For -130,000 Payment To Stormy Daniels", "content": "In a sweeping interview on Fox News Wednesday night, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani said President Donald Trump had repaid his lawyer Michael Cohen for a $130,000 payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels prior to the 2016 presidential election.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to turn out to be perfectly legal; that money was not campaign money,\u201d Giuliani, Trump\u2019s new lead attorney regarding issues related to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation, told Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity.\n\u201cSorry, I\u2019m giving you a fact now that you don\u2019t know,\u201d Giuliani continued, before saying that the payment was \u201cfunneled through a law firm, and then the president repaid it.\u201d\nThe news directly contradicts Trump\u2019s statements last month that he had no knowledge\u00a0that Cohen had paid Daniels.\u00a0Reporters aboard Air Force One had asked whether Trump knew about the payment, to which the president replied: \u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask Michael Cohen,\u201d Trump said when pressed on the issue. \u201cMichael is my attorney. You\u2019ll have to ask Michael.\u201d\nThe White House declined to comment to HuffPost.\nHogan Gidley, the deputy White House press secretary, told Fox later on Wednesday that he had \u201cno idea of the topics of the show\u201d before Giuliani\u2019s interview, but then directed all questions to Trump\u2019s outside lawyers.\nCohen is currently under criminal investigation by the Justice Department and FBI agents\u00a0raided\u00a0his office, home and hotel room last month, seizing business records and documents, including those related to the payout to Daniels. Trump has moved to\u00a0distance himself\u00a0from the attorney, saying last week Cohen only handled a \u201ctiny, tiny little fraction\u201d of his legal work.\nDuring Wednesday\u2019s interview, Giuliani said Trump paid Cohen a retainer of $35,000 \u201cwhen he was doing no work for the president\u201d and claimed the fund was used for reimbursements. Giuliani\u00a0later clarified to The New York Times that the payments to the retainer were made monthly from Trump\u2019s personal family account and that Cohen was paid between $460,000 and $470,000 in total, including money for \u201cincidental expenses.\u201d\nWhen Hannity asked if Trump knew about the details of the payments, Giuliani backtracked slightly, saying that the president \u201cdidn\u2019t know about the specifics of it, as far as I know.\u201d\nLate Wednesday,\u00a0Fox News\u2019 John Roberts said Giuliani backtracked even further and claimed that the president didn\u2019t know what the money was for, but was simply told by Cohen to pay for hundreds of thousands of dollars in unnamed \u201cexpenses.\u201d\nGiuliani\u2019s revelation appeared to take Hannity aback, and just moments after the host went off the air, Fox\u2019s Laura Ingraham questioned the bombshell.\n\u201cI love Rudy, but they better have an explanation for that,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s a problem.\u201d\nIn March, Cohen confirmed that he\u2019d made a payment to Daniels, who alleges she had an affair with Trump,\u00a0out of his own pocket.\n\u201cNeither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction with Ms. Clifford, and neither reimbursed me for the payment, either directly or indirectly,\u201d Cohen told The New York Times in a statement at the time. \u201cThe payment to Ms. Clifford was lawful, and was not a campaign contribution or a campaign expenditure by anyone.\u201d\nGiuliani\u2019s statements Wednesday also appear to contradict that claim.\nStill, shortly after the interview, Giuliani told The Wall Street Journal that Trump\u2019s earlier comments were \u201cnot [an] issue.\u201d\n\u201cCohen was his lawyer and had discretion to settle, as I have had for clients ultimately paying for it,\u201d he told the outlet, before noting that Trump was \u201cprobably not aware\u201d of the payment.\n\u201cI know the public may think the settlement may mean an admission of guilt, but it\u2019s not,\u201d\u00a0Giuliani told the Washington Post.\u00a0 \u201cPeople settle things all the time just to get rid of harassment. The amount of money tells me this was a harassment settlement.\u201d\nBut Daniels\u2019 lawyer, Michael Avenatti, said \u201cevery American, regardless of their politics, should be outraged\u201d by the news.\n\u201cMr. Trump stood on AF1 and blatantly lied,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cThis followed the lies told by others close to him, including Mr. Cohen. This should never be acceptable in our America.\u201d\u00a0\nGiuliani joined Trump\u2019s legal team\u00a0last month. John Dowd, Trump\u2019s former top lawyer, resigned in March after repeatedly butting heads with the president over how cooperative he should be with Mueller.\nDowd had urged Trump to reject any sit-down interview but grew increasingly worried that his client\u00a0would ignore his advice.", "date": "\n05/02/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/rudy-giuliani-trump-stormy-daniels_n_5aea6adee4b00f70f0eefbea", "tags": "giuliani payment repaid \u201d trump daniels cohen interview says told stormy lawyer"}
