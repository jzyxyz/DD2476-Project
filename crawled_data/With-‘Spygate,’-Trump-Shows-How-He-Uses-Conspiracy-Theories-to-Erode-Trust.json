{"title": "With \u2018Spygate,\u2019 Trump Shows How He Uses Conspiracy Theories to Erode Trust", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 As a candidate, Donald J. Trump claimed that the United States government had known in advance about the Sept. 11 attacks. He hinted that Antonin Scalia, a Supreme Court justice who died in his sleep two years ago, had been murdered. And for years, Mr. Trump pushed the notion that President Barack Obama had been born in Kenya rather than Honolulu, making him ineligible for the presidency.\nNone of that was true.\nLast week, President Trump promoted new, unconfirmed accusations to suit his political narrative: that a \u201ccriminal deep state\u201d element within Mr. Obama\u2019s government planted a spy deep inside his presidential campaign to help his rival, Hillary Clinton, win \u2014 a scheme he branded \u201cSpygate.\u201d It was the latest indication that a president who has for decades trafficked in conspiracy theories has brought them from the fringes of public discourse to the Oval Office.\nNow that he is president, Mr. Trump\u2019s baseless stories of secret plots by powerful interests appear to be having a distinct effect. Among critics, they have fanned fears that he is eroding public trust in institutions, undermining the idea of objective truth and sowing widespread suspicions about the government and news media that mirror his own.\n\u201cThe effect on the life of the nation of a president inventing conspiracy theories in order to distract attention from legitimate investigations or other things he dislikes is corrosive,\u201d said Jon Meacham, a presidential historian and biographer. \u201cThe diabolical brilliance of the Trump strategy of disinformation is that many people are simply going to hear the charges and countercharges, and decide that there must be something to them because the president of the United States is saying them.\u201d\nThe effects were evident in Washington on Thursday, when the Justice Department held a pair of unusual briefings with lawmakers to share sensitive information about the special counsel investigation into Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election and whether the Trump campaign worked with Moscow to sway the contest. Those sessions came about because the president publicly hectored the department to cough up information about an F.B.I. informant he branded a political spy against him.\nBut Mr. Trump\u2019s willingness to peddle suspicion as fact has implications beyond the Russia inquiry. It is a vital ingredient in the president\u2019s communications arsenal, a social media-fueled, brashly expressed narrative of dubious accusations and dark insinuations that allows him to promote his own version of reality.\nStudents of Mr. Trump\u2019s life and communication style argue that the idea of conspiracies is a vital part of his strategy to avoid accountability and punch back at detractors, real or perceived, including the news media.\n\u201cHe\u2019s the blame shifter in chief,\u201d said Gwenda Blair, a Trump biographer. \u201cConspiracies, by definition, are things that others do to you. You\u2019re being duped; you\u2019re being fooled; the world is laughing at us. It goes to this idea that you can\u2019t believe anything that you read or see. He has sold us a whole way of accepting a narrative that has so many layers of unaccountable, unsubstantiated content that you can\u2019t possibly peel it all back.\u201d\nLike most conspiracy theories, Mr. Trump\u2019s latest has a kernel of truth many Republicans have latched on to. Several news organizations, including The New York Times, have reported that an F.B.I. informant contacted Trump campaign aides who evidence suggested had had suspicious contacts with Russians in 2016 as part of a counterintelligence investigation into possible efforts by Moscow to meddle in the election.\nIn Mr. Trump\u2019s telling, however, the informant was a spy sent by Mr. Obama and a cabal inside his Justice Department and the intelligence community who were bent on stopping his candidacy.\nFormer aides to the president, speaking privately because they did not want to embarrass him, said paranoia predisposed him to believe in nefarious, hidden forces driving events. But they also said political opportunism informed his promotion of conspiracy theories. For instance, two former aides said Mr. Trump had resisted using the term \u201cdeep state\u201d for months, partly because he believed it made him look too much like a crank.\nBut Mr. Trump saw that it played well in the conservative news media, and so in November, he began using it, the two aides said. The strategy appears to have yielded results. Several polls have shown a dip in public approval of the special counsel investigation over the past several months, as the president has repeatedly attacked it. And a Monmouth Poll released in March found that a bipartisan majority believes an unelected \u201cdeep state\u201d is manipulating national policy.\nSam Nunberg, a former Trump aide who worked for him when he began championing false claims about Mr. Obama\u2019s birthplace, said the president was reflecting the media that fueled his core supporters.\n\u201cIn the new media landscape, InfoWars and Fox News are where the president\u2019s getting his support, and these theories are promulgated there,\u201d said Mr. Nunberg, who disputed that \u201cSpygate\u201d qualified as a conspiracy theory.\nMr. Trump\u2019s talk of conspiracies has also gained currency within a Republican Party establishment that once shunned it.\nDuring the 2016 campaign, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, denounced Mr. Trump\u2019s talk of the government hiding the real story about Sept. 11. \u201cThat\u2019s something that really only comes from the kook part of America,\u201d Mr. Graham said at the time.\nMr. Graham said he had also been highly skeptical when Mr. Trump insisted last year that Mr. Obama had tapped his phones in Trump Tower, a stunning assertion for which he offered no proof.\n\u201cI thought, \u2018Well, that doesn\u2019t seem right to me,\u2019\u201d Mr. Graham said last week. But, he noted, it was later revealed that one of Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign associates, Carter Page, had in fact been under surveillance. And on \u201cSpygate,\u201d the senator added, \u201cThere seems to be something to this one. I want to find out: Did it happen? Is there a good reason?\u201d\nSenator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, distanced himself from the president\u2019s sinister language, but not necessarily the questions he had raised about the informant. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t describe it the way he described it,\u201d Mr. Cornyn said. \u201cConfidential informant? Spy? I guess he can use his own words.\u201d\nThen, like many lawmakers who once denounced the president\u2019s assaults on law enforcement agencies, Mr. Cornyn gave the president a level of validation, saying it was worth knowing what the F.B.I.\u2019s \u201cmotivation\u201d was in the inquiry into the Trump campaign.\nMr. Trump is not the first public figure to charge that he is the subject of a shadowy plot. Mrs. Clinton memorably declared during impeachment proceedings against her husband, Bill Clinton, that they were the victims of a \u201cvast, right-wing conspiracy,\u201d although the president himself never used the word at the time.\nMr. Meacham pointed to an 1866 speech at a tumultuous moment of post-Civil War Reconstruction, in which President Andrew Johnson said that his political enemies were plotting to assassinate him. President Richard M. Nixon believed that an elitist cabal led by Ivy League-educated denizens of Georgetown and Washington Post journalists was working secretly to bring him down. Both presidents, Mr. Meacham noted, were self-made men who harbored deep insecurities, not unlike the current Oval Office occupant.\nErick Erickson, the founder of the conservative website RedState, who once described Mr. Trump as a \u201cwalking, talking National Enquirer,\u201d said the president\u2019s invented stories also speak to the public\u2019s desire to have an easy explanation for events it cannot control.\n\u201cA lot of people really want to believe a conspiracy because it\u2019s a lot easier to think a malevolent force is in charge than that our government is run by idiots,\u201d Mr. Erickson said in an interview.\nRepresentative Peter T. King, a New York Republican who is sometimes a critic of Mr. Trump, said one need not believe in conspiracies to recognize that the president was onto something with his seemingly far-fetched charges.\n\u201cI do believe that people like Clapper, to some extent Comey, they had this bias against him,\u201d Mr. King said, naming James R. Clapper Jr., the former director of national intelligence, and James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, both viewed by Mr. Trump as enemies bent on his destruction. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a grand conspiracy. I just think they were living in an echo chamber and believed the worst.\u201d\nBut even as he took issue with the president\u2019s framing, Mr. King marveled at how the president has bent the discourse to his own views, transforming the term \u201cdeep state\u201d into \u201calmost a metaphor for a group in society that doesn\u2019t understand real people, forgotten people, and are willing to use their power to stop Trump.\u201d\n\u201cHe has a talent for getting a point across using hyperbole,\u201d Mr. King said, adding, \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt he has changed the debate.\u201d", "date": "May 28, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/28/us/politics/trump-conspiracy-theories-spygate.html", "tags": "erode trust \u2018 \u201c deep uses former theories spygate trump shows said campaign conspiracy"}
