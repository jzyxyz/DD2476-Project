{"title": "Southampton non-charging Clean Air Zone plan agreed", "content": "Plans to introduce a non-charging clean air zone in Southampton have been unanimously approved by councillors.\nThe scheme, which will remove the most polluting taxis and impose new rules on buses, aims to bring air quality to within legal levels by 2020.\nIt was criticised by campaigners after plans to charge vehicles were dropped.\nCouncil leader Chris Hammond said the scheme was \"never about the wider clean air issues\" but it would bring the city within nitrogen dioxide (NO2) limits.\nAbout 56% of the 10,000 people who responded to a public consultation had supported the original proposal to charge high-polluting vehicles up to \u00a3100 a day to drive into the city.\nBut earlier this month the council said it could meet government limits through a \"refined set of freight, bus and taxi measures\".\nThe meeting at Southampton City Council heard the city's port had also expressed plans to install shore power which would allow ships to run on electrical energy, instead of leaving their engines running while docked, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.\nAssociated British Ports (ABP) director Alastair Welch said it was \"a big opportunity\" to achieve the legal obligation, but added: \"Now we need to work together as a city to bring in even more pollution improvements within the area.\"\nSouthampton is one of four English cities preparing to introduce clean air zones by 2020.\nThe others are Birmingham, Derby and Leeds.", "date": "22 January 2019", "href": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-hampshire-46961926", "tags": "introduce council clean within city southampton bring agreed plans non-charging zone air plan"}
