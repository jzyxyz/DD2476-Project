{"title": "Restaurant Review: Blanca in Bushwick, Brooklyn", "content": "When Blanca opened in 2012, a 27-course tasting menu served at a counter behind a pizzeria in Bushwick sounded like the setup to a joke. (Second prize is 30 courses.) The restaurant does have its sense of humor, but it quickly proved that about cooking for maximum pleasure, it was unswervingly serious. \nCarlo Mirarchi, the chef and an owner of Blanca and its sprawling mother ship, Roberta\u2019s, was a rigorous miniaturist, combining a few ingredients at a time into two- or three-bite compositions that were utterly complete, even if they left you wanting more. At 31, he already had an impressive sense of what to put on a plate and what to leave off.\nWhat he didn\u2019t have yet was a repertoire deep enough for the length of the meals he served. My early dinners at Blanca were marked by dishes that seemed like placeholders, and there were moments when the kitchen\u2019s reach exceeded its technical grasp. It was as if Mr. Mirarchi were giving you a tour of a mansion he\u2019d bought before the contractor had finished the punch list. Most of the place was spectacular, but there were rooms where you would not want to spend the night.\nBeing a critic, I had a suggestion, hinted at in my two-star review that year: make the meal shorter and cheaper. Being a chef, Mr. Mirarchi ignored me and kept refining his marathon tastings, very gradually.\n\u201cThe menu changes so slowly that for us it\u2019s like watching your hair grow,\u201d Leslie Vinyard, Blanca\u2019s welcoming and gracious service captain, remarked one night from behind the countertop. So it may have taken a while, but every time I\u2019ve settled into one of the padded brown-leather captain\u2019s chairs recently, nearly everything I\u2019ve tasted has been remarkable in one way or another. \nOne dinner this spring got rolling with a fat little Pacific Northwest oyster. Sharing its deep cup-shaped shell were juicy round cells of finger lime that popped in my mouth like citrus caviar, and a pool of green juice pressed from roasted asparagus, an ingenious combination that teased a mild cucumber flavor out of the oyster. \nAt the end of the night, asparagus came back. Samantha Short, the pastry chef, had made a sort of coconut semifreddo, silky on the tongue, which hovered over a spoonful or two of white asparagus soup seasoned with sugar and salt. Sweet and savory, tropical and vegetal flavors crashed together and bloomed into something daring and great. The desserts after some mega-tastings are gradual diminuendos. This was a mike drop. \nOver three meals since October, I\u2019ve experienced all sorts of flavor detonations: a streaky fold of raw pancetta with a burst of black peppercorns; a salt-roasted Japanese sweet potato with an unexpectedly dreamy dressing of macadamia milk and ground espresso beans; a crunchy wedge of tart apple carrying a small, remarkable payload of garlic, olive oil, anchovies, fried bread crumbs and cardoons cooked in apple juice. \nI have also started looking forward to sunchokes, a vegetable that has a hard time getting more out of me than grudging acceptance. Blanca caramelized them deeply, steeped them in soy milk, then whipped them into a cream. A ragged leaf of toasted sea lettuce supplied a bottom note, and the crumb of beeswax and honey at the bottom of the dish made my eyes go wide, every time.\nThen there are the agnolotti parcels that are like Freshen Up gum from the dark side. They burst when you bite down with an oozing, inky-green liquid made from melted taleggio and phytoplankton. The flavor is like a distillation of spinach, seaweed and squid ink. It\u2019s a totally disorienting sensation, and while I love it, not everyone will. I think of this course as the one guest-directed by David Lynch. It is when the dwarf starts to dance.\nOne of Mr. Mirarchi\u2019s sillier conceits in the early days was making you wait more than two hours for an ordinary slice of filone, presented as its own course. You still wait, but now it\u2019s worth it. The breads made by Nina Subhas may include a soft Hawaiian sweet roll with pineapple juice in the dough and black salt on top, and a flaky garlic knot that\u2019s like a savory Danish. Or you may be given a chunk torn from a squat round loaf made from Roberta\u2019s pizza dough. Brushed with olive oil, this steaming-hot pizza bread doesn\u2019t need the house-made butter, not that I let that stop me.\nOnce, grilled snow crabs were served with a deliciously funky crab-innards sauce. Now the steamed legs of very recently living king crabs come with a saffron-colored slosh of melted butter sauce whipped with shaved bottarga. The sauce is an upgrade, less likely to step on the sweetness of the shellfish, and I\u2019ve never again been served gelatinous, half-raw crab legs as I was in 2012. This has become one of New York\u2019s essential dishes, along with the \u2019nduja raviolo, an explosion of spicy pork lava, the one item that has been on the lineup since opening night. \nMr. Mirarchi\u2019s notion of what al dente means seems to have softened. So has the pasta, slightly, but I\u2019ll deal with the extra-chewy core of tightly hand-rolled noodles to taste his creamy, yolk-rich carbonara with lamb fat and cured lamb breast. \nBeneath the body of Blanca\u2019s menu is an Italian chassis, so after pasta come the meat courses. There may be a few rosy slices of roast duck placed beside a slow-burning beet mole, followed by porchetta with chimichurri. The servings are never very large and never as hot as I\u2019d like, but the meat is always juicier and more concentrated than almost any other restaurant can manage. \nWhen you say \u201csavory desserts,\u201d some people look for the exits. None of these people have tasted Ms. Short\u2019s intermezzos and finales. She can make the heat and the vegetal taste of poblano peppers seem like sensible, delicious additions to a cake. One night, her parting shot was a chocolate-Parmesan ice cream with shaved white truffles. It was another mike drop.\nOne could, and come to think of it one will, complain that Blanca offers no wine bottles under $80 and no glasses under $18. Customers who have torn a hole in their budget to afford the $195 for dinner, before tax and tip, shouldn\u2019t have to drink beer all night. Not that this would be a terrible fate; Blanca\u2019s beers are as varied and full of character as the sakes and wines. A course-by-course wine pairing can be had for $95, but Shanti Carson, the sommelier, excels at working with people who aren\u2019t that thirsty. \nMs. Carson is also the one who placed the vinyl on the turntable when I decided to prove to the other 11 people at the counter that \u201cNew York Groove\u201d isn\u2019t the only good song on Ace Frehley\u2019s first solo album. \nThe record collection, which Mr. Mirarchi may well have lifted straight from the garage of his childhood home, is one of the ways Blanca deflates high-end dining\u2019s gassier pretensions. His aim has always been to run a restaurant that is both a luxury and a weird adventure. The entrance tells you everything. You walk into a cinder-block bomb shelter of a pizzeria, past the crowds eating pies with names like Lamb of God. You turn left at the bar, go out the door, take another left at the radio studio and a right at the tiki bar. Keep going past the shipping containers and the outdoor oven, walk down a couple of steps, through the door, and you\u2019re inside Bushwick\u2019s first three-star restaurant.", "date": "June 16, 2015", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/17/dining/restaurant-review-blanca-in-bushwick-brooklyn.html", "tags": "like may made blanca served restaurant one night bushwick mirarchi review brooklyn"}
