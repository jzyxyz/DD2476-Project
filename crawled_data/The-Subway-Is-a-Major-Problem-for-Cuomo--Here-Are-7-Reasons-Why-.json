{"title": "The Subway Is a Major Problem for Cuomo. Here Are 7 Reasons Why.", "content": "As Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo runs for a third term, the subway is a thorn in his side.\nMr. Cuomo is expected to easily win re-election Nov. 6. But that doesn\u2019t mean New Yorkers are happy about his management of the crumbling transit system. \nA new ad by Marcus J. Molinaro, his Republican challenger, features Twitter posts from angry subway riders and declares: \u201cUnder Andrew Cuomo the #MTA is derailing,\u201d referring to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the subway.\nMr. Molinaro has offered his own transit agenda, which focuses on reducing construction costs.\nMr. Cuomo, a Democrat, helped create the subway crisis by failing to adequately support the system \u2014 his administration even diverted transit funding to ski resorts \u2014 and he has been pilloried by subway advocates for prioritizing aesthetics over maintenance.\nBut the governor, who declared the subway to be in a state of emergency last year, has also won praise for hiring Andy Byford, a highly respected transit executive who introduced a $40 billion overhaul plan to save the subway. Mr. Cuomo supported the agency's roughly $800 million subway repair plan and has committed about $8 billion from the state for capital spending. And Mr. Cuomo revived a push for congestion pricing, a proposal to raise money for public transit by tolling vehicles entering Manhattan\u2019s busiest areas, even though it carries political risks.\nHere are some of the decisions Mr. Cuomo has made that have been widely questioned:\nMr. Cuomo has focused on attention-grabbing projects like the Second Avenue line on the Upper East Side of Manhattan \u2014 which, so far, comprises three new stations \u2014 instead of on routine repairs to the subway\u2019s infrastructure. It was the failure to keep the tracks and trains properly maintained that led to the subway\u2019s crisis, according to an investigation last year by The New York Times.\nMr. Cuomo, for example, pushed the M.T.A. to spend nearly $1 billion on enhanced lighting and signs and other upgrades to stations that did not improve train service. He also pressured the authority to study outfitting M.T.A. bridges with lights capable of choreographed display.\nCuomo\u2019s take: The governor has said that the Second Avenue line is an important project  that had been languishing, and that he wants stations to have modern amenities. \nSince Mr. Cuomo took office in 2011, the M.T.A.\u2019s debt has risen to more than $38 billion from about $32 billion. The debt, transit groups note, is higher than the national debt of several countries, including Iceland and Panama. \nNearly 17 percent of the agency\u2019s budget goes to paying down debt \u2014 roughly triple what it paid in 1997. The debt is expected to reach more than $42 billion by 2022, according to a new report by the state comptroller.\nCuomo\u2019s take: His budget director, Robert Mujica, said it was sensible for the M.T.A. to borrow money to \u201cinvest in assets that are going to last a long time.\u201d\nThe M.T.A. has approved generous agreements with labor unions under Mr. Cuomo, awarding raises that have taken a bite out of the agency\u2019s budget. \nAnd the Transport Workers Union, which represents thousands of subway and bus workers, has donated more than $180,000 to Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaigns and waged a public push to support him. Union members won a total of 19 percent in pay raises between 2009 and 2016, compared with 12 percent for the city\u2019s teachers\u2019 union over the same period.\nA Cuomo aide told transit officials to approve the raises and worry about finding the money later, according to two former M.T.A. officials.\nCuomo\u2019s take: Mr. Cuomo\u2019s office has said the M.T.A. handled its own labor negotiations and campaign contributions had not influenced any of his actions.\nMany of the subway\u2019s problems were well known before service reached a crisis point last year. Yet Mr. Cuomo was slow to act. \nWhen the state won billions of dollars from large settlements with banks after the 2008 financial crisis, Mr. Cuomo chose not to spend a major slice of the money on mass transit. He also brushed aside the findings of the M.T.A. Transportation Reinvention Commission, a 2014 panel of transit leaders Mr. Cuomo convened from around the world, which warned of growing concerns about maintenance.\nCuomo\u2019s take: He has said that the subway fell apart not just on his watch, but after decades of underinvestment, and that the state had other priorities for the settlement money, including upgrading highways.\nMr. Cuomo continued the practice of forcing the M.T.A. to pay the state for something known as bond issuance fees, which essentially pay for financial advice on borrowing.\nThe M.T.A., which has multiple bond experts, had to pay $328 million in bond issuance fees over the past 15 years. After The Times raised questions over the fees, state officials said they would no longer impose bond issuance fees on the M.T.A.\nCuomo\u2019s take: State officials defended the payments, saying their staff met periodically with M.T.A. officials to discuss when to issue bonds.\nMr. Cuomo\u2019s administration forced the M.T.A. to send $5 million to bail out three state-run ski resorts that were struggling, a decision that was first reported by The New York Daily News. \nThe bailout was part of a trend in which the state made the transit agency help other entities, including sending $5 million to the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority to cover the cost of reducing tolls in 2013, according to The Times investigation.\nCuomo\u2019s take: State officials have said that the M.T.A. owed the state the $5 million it sent to ski resorts and that it paled in comparison to the funding the state provides to the transit agency each year.\nDuring Mr. Cuomo\u2019s second term, he suddenly took an intense interest in the M.T.A. \nMr. Cuomo placed aides within the organization and, in an unusual move, made some report directly to him. Mr. Cuomo\u2019s style troubled the well-liked former M.T.A. chairman Thomas F. Prendergast, who retired in early 2017. Mr. Prendergast said his decision was not related to the governor, but several of his former colleagues said it was a factor.\nMr. Cuomo badgered Mr. Prendergast and other leaders to finish the Second Avenue subway by Jan. 1, 2017. The pressure led officials to rush the work. When the new stations opened, the fire alarm testing was not completed and more than 17,000 defects found during inspections had not been fixed, according to oversight reports obtained by The Times.\nCuomo\u2019s take: He has said that the M.T.A. is a mess and needs his help, and that it was important for the Second Avenue line to open on time to improve the agency\u2019s credibility with the public.", "date": "Oct. 23, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/23/nyregion/nyc-subway-delays-cuomo.html", "tags": "officials problem take subway reasons m.t.a cuomo state transit new major"}
