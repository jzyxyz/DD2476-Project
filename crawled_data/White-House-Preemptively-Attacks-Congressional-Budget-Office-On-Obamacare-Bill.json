The CBO believed, for example, that states would be eager to set up their own exchanges and to expand Medicaid coverage, given that the federal government was paying for nearly all of it.\nBut in many states, Republicans opposed to health care expansion, or in some cases opposed to Obama personally, worked to block both of those.\nA Commonwealth Fund study, in fact, showed that the CBO was more right in its forecasts about the Affordable Care Act than anyone else. \nThe Congressional Budget Office works independently of leadership in Congress to analyze the costs and effects of legislation. Congress for decades has relied on its \u201cscores\u201d when drafting and debating bills.\nThe White House attack on its efficacy follows similar evidence-free assertions \u2015 that millions voted illegally in the November elections, for example, or that Obama \u201cwire tapped\u201d Trump at his midtown Manhattan headquarters.\nWhat makes the criticism of the CBO particularly ironic is that its current director, Keith Hall, was given the job by Republicans after they took control of Congress\u00a0\u2013 largely because of his perceived friendliness to GOP initiatives.\nSpicer, nevertheless, said the office\u2019s analysis ought to be taken with skepticism. \u201cTheir record is what I\u2019m calling into question. When you look at the number of people and the cost on what they scored the last Obamacare bill on, it\u2019s way off,\u201d Spicer said.\nTrump and congressional Republican leaders are rushing their bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act and \u201creplace\u201d it with their own version, as they have been promising for years. They aim for floor votes and delivery to Trump\u2019s desk before lawmakers leave Washington for their mid-April recess.\nTwo House committees began moving the legislation Wednesday without a CBO analysis about what it would do \u2015 to the consternation of Democrats, who failed to force the panels to delay their proceedings until they had that information.\nThe bill would drastically reduce federal spending on health care programs for low- and middle-income people, so it\u2019s almost certain to result in millions of Americans becoming uninsured. \nAnd since the measure also contains substantial tax cuts for wealthy people and health care companies, it may wind up increasing the budget deficit. If the Congressional Budget Office comes to that conclusion, that will likely exacerbate the revolt among the most conservative congressional Republicans against the bill.\nThe ratings agency Standard & Poor\u2019s projects 6 million to 10 million people would lose their coverage under this legislation, and the Center for a Responsible Federal Budget says the tax cuts are worth $600 billion.\nToday\u2019s Republicans didn\u2019t invent griping about the CBO \u2015 Democrats certainly did their fair share when writing the Affordable Care Act in 2009 and 2010.\nBut the White House and GOP lawmakers appear to be taking things further by questioning the very legitimacy of the office tasked with telling lawmakers and the American people what new policies will do to the government, businesses, households and the economy.\nThe CBO is designed to allow objective analysis by evaluating all legislation the same way. Comparing a CBO score on one bill to a CBO score on another allows apples-to-apples juxtaposition of their effects. And its findings are available to the public.\nSpicer himself used to be much more trusting of Congressional Budget Office numbers, when they suited his previous bosses\u2019 agendas. \n\u2018\u2019You\u2019re blaming the messenger,\u2019\u2019 Spicer told The New York Times in 2004,\u00a0when he was spokesman for the House Budget Committee, referring to Republican lawmakers complaining that a previous GOP-appointed CBO director wasn\u2019t giving them the answers they wanted.\nAt the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, congressional Republicans were joining the CBO bashing. At a House Energy and Commerce Committee meeting to advance the health care bill, Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) described the Congressional Budget Office as \u201cunelected bureaucrats in Washington.\u201d\nThe White House, meanwhile, proposes using its own in-house numbers-crunchers. Spicer suggested that the Office of Management and Budget \u2013 run by Trump appointee Mick Mulvaney \u2013 would be a better source for an accurate assessment. Unlike the Congressional Budget Office, the OMB isn\u2019t independent, and answers to the president.\nIn the fraught environment of the the health care law, Spicer and other Republicans are arguing that the CBO\u2019s weakness on this topic was proven by its projections about the Affordable Care Act that turned out wrong.\nFor example, the Congressional Budget Office originally predicted the law would cover more people. But then the Supreme Court ruled that states could opt out of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Medicaid expansion, leaving millions of poor people in those states uninsured. The CBO also predicted higher enrollment on the health insurance exchanges. But the agency incorrectly assumed \u2015 as Republicans constantly warned at the time \u2015 that employers would end job-based health benefits and direct workers to the exchanges instead, which didn\u2019t happen. \nAnd those two items, along with slower-than-expected growth in health care costs nationwide, combined to result in the CBO being wrong about another thing: the amount of money the law would cost, which wound up being less than expected.\nThese are the kinds of faulty projections that could come out of any entity attempting to forecast the effects of a major law. Because the Congressional Budget Office doesn\u2019t serve a particular agenda \u2015 as the Office of Management and Budget and industry groups do \u2015 it regularly revises scores to reflect new information.\nUPDATE: 7:51 p.m. \u2015\u00a0Douglas Elmendorf, who was CBO director when Congress wrote the Affordable Act Act, and is now dean of the John F.
