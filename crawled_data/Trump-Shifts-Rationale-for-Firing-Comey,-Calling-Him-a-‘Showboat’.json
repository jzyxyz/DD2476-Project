{"title": "Trump Shifts Rationale for Firing Comey, Calling Him a \u2018Showboat\u2019", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump offered a new version of his decision to fire James B. Comey, saying on Thursday that he would have dismissed the F.B.I. director regardless of whether the attorney general and his deputy recommended it.\nIt was just the latest in a series of statements, some of them contradictory, to whiplash Washington over 48 hours that began with Mr. Comey\u2019s firing on Tuesday evening. And it was unusually harsh: Mr. Trump castigated Mr. Comey as \u201ca showboat\u201d and \u201ca grandstander,\u201d suggesting that his issues with the F.B.I. director went beyond any previously stated concerns.\nMr. Trump said on Thursday that he had not relied solely on the advice from the Justice Department\u2019s top two leaders in making his decision. And, for the first time, he explicitly referenced the F.B.I.\u2019s investigation into his administration\u2019s ties to Russia in defending Mr. Comey\u2019s firing.\n\u201cAnd in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said, \u2018You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump told Lester Holt of NBC News. \u201cIt\u2019s an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have won.\u201d\nEarlier, the White House had said that Mr. Trump acted only after Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, came to him and recommended that Mr. Comey be dismissed because of his handling of last year\u2019s investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s email. In his Tuesday letter terminating Mr. Comey, Mr. Trump said he had \u201caccepted their recommendation.\u201d And Vice President Mike Pence, talking to reporters, echoed his boss.\nBut by the next day, that story had begun to unravel.\nMr. Rosenstein and Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, spoke by telephone on Wednesday to review details that precipitated the firing, seeking to agree on a version of events that could be released to the public.\nThat conversation led to a new timeline that the White House shared with reporters hours later. It said that Mr. Trump had in recent weeks been \u201cstrongly inclined to remove\u201d Mr. Comey, but that he had made his final decision only after receiving written recommendations on Tuesday from Mr. Rosenstein and Mr. Sessions.\nAnd then on Thursday, the president himself brushed away that narrative, reversing his own aides\u2019 version of events.\nIn fact, the president asserted, he had decided to fire Mr. Comey well before he received the advice from the Justice Department officials. He said he was frustrated by Mr. Comey\u2019s public testimony regarding the F.B.I. investigation into Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 campaign and its possible contacts with Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers.\n\u201cI was going to fire Comey \u2014 my decision,\u201d Mr. Trump told NBC. \u201cI was going to fire regardless of recommendation.\u201d\nThe president\u2019s comments appeared aimed at reassuring Mr. Rosenstein, who was reportedly upset at the White House\u2019s original narrative that seemed to suggest he had instigated Mr. Comey\u2019s firing. The White House has cited Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s reputation as a straight shooter in justifying Mr. Trump\u2019s move.\nBut the president\u2019s story line left the White House struggling to explain his motivation for firing his F.B.I. director a day after calling the Russia investigation nothing more than a \u201ctaxpayer funded charade\u201d that should end.\nCritics said the credibility of the White House had been badly damaged and renewed calls for a special prosecutor to take over the Russia investigation, independent of the administration.\nThe White House\u2019s explanation was challenged on Thursday in other ways as well. The president\u2019s spokeswoman said on Wednesday that Mr. Comey was fired in part because he had lost the support of rank-and-file F.B.I. employees. But on Thursday, Andrew G. McCabe, the new acting director of the agency, told the Senate that Mr. Comey enjoyed \u201cbroad support within the F.B.I. and still does to this day.\u201d\nAnd while the White House said on Wednesday that the Russia inquiry was only a small part of the bureau\u2019s activities, Mr. McCabe called it \u201ca highly significant investigation.\u201d\nThroughout the rapidly shifting 48 hours, Mr. Rosenstein appeared to be caught in the middle.\nConfirmed just last month, he made a trip to Capitol Hill on Thursday for a previously unannounced meeting with the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee. In a brief hallway conversation with a reporter, Mr. Rosenstein denied reports that he had threatened to quit.\nSenator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, has agreed to invite Mr. Rosenstein to brief the entire Senate next week, said the minority leader, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York.\nIn his Wednesday deliberations, Mr. Rosenstein made clear that the timeline needed to be accurate, and that he did not want to \u201cmassage\u201d the version of events. His discussions included Mr. McGahn, Mr. Sessions and other senior administration officials, according to a person familiar with the conversation who was not authorized to discuss it. It concluded with a four-sentence statement that was released by the White House on Wednesday evening.\nThat statement noted that Mr. Trump had met with both Mr. Rosenstein and Mr. Sessions on Monday to discuss reasons to remove Mr. Comey. It said that Mr. Rosenstein had submitted his written recommendation to Mr. Sessions on Tuesday, who sent his own recommendation to Mr. Trump soon afterward.\nMr. Rosenstein\u2019s memo, while highly critical of Mr. Comey\u2019s actions over the past year, stopped short of explicitly recommending his ouster. \u201cAlthough the president has the power to remove an F.B.I. director,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthe decision should not be taken lightly.\u201d\nIn the NBC interview, Mr. Trump elaborated on his claim that Mr. Comey had told him on three occasions that the president himself was not under investigation. The F.B.I. has been looking into whether associates of Mr. Trump and his campaign coordinated with Russia as Moscow orchestrated an effort to intervene in the American election and tilt the election to Mr. Trump.\nMr. Trump said Mr. Comey had reassured him first at a private dinner, and then during two phone conversations. He acknowledged that he had directly asked if he was being investigated.\n\u201cI said, \u2018If it\u2019s possible, would you let me know if I\u2019m under investigation?\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cHe said, \u2018You are not under investigation.\u2019\u201d\nThe admission raised questions on Thursday among reporters, who asked Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the deputy White House press secretary, whether it was inappropriate for the president to ask the F.B.I. director whether he was under investigation. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t believe it is,\u201d Ms. Sanders said.\nThe president said Mr. Comey requested the dinner early in his administration to ask to keep his job. That would be an unusual \u2014 and perhaps unnecessary \u2014 step for an F.B.I. director, who by law is appointed for a 10-year term. Mr. Comey was four years into his term when Mr. Trump was inaugurated.\n\u201cHe wanted to stay on as the F.B.I. head,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI said: \u2018I\u2019ll consider. We\u2019ll see what happens.\u2019 But we had a very nice dinner and at that time, he told me I wasn\u2019t under investigation, which I knew anyway.\u201d\nIn explaining his decision to fire Mr. Comey, Mr. Trump said that \u201cthe F.B.I. has been in turmoil\u201d since last year, an apparent reference to the controversy over how the Clinton investigation was managed, and \u201cit hasn\u2019t recovered from that.\u201d\nMr. Trump also insisted, as he has before, that there was \u201cno collusion between my campaign and Russia.\u201d\nThe interview underscored what has been a continuing challenge for the Trump administration to provide the public with accurate information about the president\u2019s actions and motivations.\nOn Tuesday evening, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said in an interview on Fox Business Network that it was Mr. Rosenstein who had \u201cmade a determination\u201d about Mr. Comey and the president had followed it. At the time, Mr. Spicer was merely dutifully relaying the White House\u2019s position.\nMr. Pence did the same in his comments to reporters the next day. And at the daily White House briefing on Wednesday, Ms. Sanders was asked whether the advice from Mr. Rosenstein and Mr. Sessions was only a pretext for a decision the president had already made. \u201cNo,\u201d she said.\nOn Thursday, after the president\u2019s NBC interview, she changed gears.\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t had a chance to have the conversation directly with the president,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d had several conversations with him, but I didn\u2019t ask that question directly \u2014 \u2018had you already made that decision.\u2019 I went off of the information that I had when I answered your question.\u201d\nBut she stuck by her contention that Mr. Comey had lost the faith of his employees \u2014 even though the agency\u2019s acting director had contradicted it. \u201cI\u2019ve certainly heard from a large number of individuals, and that\u2019s just myself,\u201d Ms. Sanders said, \u201cand I don\u2019t even know that many people in the F.B.I.\u201d", "date": "May 11, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/11/us/politics/trump-comey-showboat-fbi.html", "tags": "\u2018 \u201c rosenstein comey showboat shifts rationale white trump house calling firing said"}
