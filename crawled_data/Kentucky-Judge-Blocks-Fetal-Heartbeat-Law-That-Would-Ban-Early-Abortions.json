{"title": "Kentucky Judge Blocks Fetal Heartbeat Law That Would Ban Early Abortions", "content": "A Kentucky judge has blocked a controversial law that would ban abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected, which is typically about six weeks into a pregnancy.\nThe ruling by Judge David J. Hale of the state\u2019s western judicial district came hours after Republican Gov. Matt Bevin signed the measure into law,\u00a0The New York Times reported.\nHale found that the law was potentially unconstitutional and ordered a hearing within the next 14 days to hear presentations on it.\nThe ACLU, which filed suit against the new law on Friday, estimates that the legislation would ban 90% of abortions in Kentucky,\u00a0given that most women don\u2019t realize they\u2019re pregnant until the seventh week of their pregnancy or later.\n\u201cTaking another page straight out of the anti-abortion playbook, Kentucky became the latest state to pass a law that will ban abortion before most women know they\u2019re pregnant,\u201d Brigitte Amiri, deputy director of the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project, said in a statement. \u201cThese bans are blatantly unconstitutional, and we will ask the court to strike it down.\u201d\nSimilar so-called \u201cheartbeat bills\u201d have been proposed across the country, most recently in Tennessee and Georgia.\nIn January, a judge in Iowa struck down a heartbeat law passed the legislature, saying that a woman\u2019s right to decide whether to terminate a pregnancy is protected by the state\u2019s Constitution.\nKentucky Attorney General Andy Beshear (D) had warned the state\u2019s lawmakers in January that the heartbeat bill was unlikely to pass constitutional muster.\n\u201cThe Supreme Court of the United States has uniformly held \u2014 in no fewer than eight separate decisions \u2014 that neither Congress nor a state legislature can ban abortions\u201d before a fetus\u2019 viability, he said in a letter, according to The Lexington Herald-Leader. Such viability occurs much later in a pregnancy.", "date": "\n03/17/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/fetal-heartbeat-law-blocked-kentucky_n_5c8e4621e4b0d7f6b0f48c66", "tags": "ban blocks abortions kentucky early heartbeat judge would \u201d pregnancy state fetal law"}
