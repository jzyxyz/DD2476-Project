{"title": "Reviewing the Met Gala Runway: \u2018Manus vs. Machina\u2019", "content": "We should have known what we were in for when Taylor Swift arrived.\nMs. Swift, who has been on something of a campaign to crush her former ladylike image, seized her moment as co-host of the Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute Gala this year to make a different kind of statement, arriving just after 6 p.m. to take her place on the receiving line in a tiered halter-necked silver crocodile print Louis Vuitton dress with side cutouts, knee-high spiked gladiator boots, dark lipstick and a shock of platinum hair. Think Pris of \u201cBlade Runner\u201d reimagined by Marvel and ready to join the Avengers, and you\u2019ll get the idea. The dress divided the online-viewing community, and set the tone for the night.\nIf the theme of this year\u2019s blockbuster exhibition is \u201cManus x Machina,\u201d the dress code for the opening party seemed to be, rather \u201cManus vs. Machina\u201d and fall into one of the two categories. For anyone wondering why the promise of wearables is as yet unfulfilled, this red carpet was the answer. Apparently, when designers think fashion and technology, they think Mr. Roboto.\nThe predominant color of the evening was silver, and the predominant pattern was circuitry. This was as simple as the silver sequins on Anna Ewers (in Boss), Brie Larson (in Proenza Schouler, also with side cutouts, which were something of a trend), and Gigi Hadid (in a Tommy Hilfiger bustier bodysuit with a chiffon overlay and metallic neckpiece), or as elaborate as Kim Kardashian\u2019s pieced-together gown of Balmain armor. The brand had something of a banner evening, dressing not only most of the Kardashians but also a number of assorted models. It turns out the designer Olivier Rousteing\u2019s penchant for dresses made from elaborate, ropelike macram\u00e9 bears an unexpected resemblance to a motherboard \u2014 also the theme of Kendall Jenner\u2019s wired-up Versace dress and Lady Gaga\u2019s Versace jacket, worn without pants because, well, in the future, who needs them?\n(Madonna also had a pants-less moment, in Givenchy, though the reasoning behind that look, which included a long lace train and thigh and arm wraps, was less apparent.)\nAt least Beyonc\u00e9, in skin-tone latex Givenchy, like some sort of synthetic goddess, abstracted the idea a little, as did the clone wars trio of Jenna Lyons, Lena Dunham and Jenni Konner, in matching J. Crew tuxes. But generally, there was little obvious experimentation on display, save for Solange Knowles, who seemed to be channeling a genetically modified lemon drop via fanlike pleating by David Laport and patent thigh-highs.\nYou can understand it \u2014 it\u2019s risky to step into the digital corner, because no one really knows what the splicing of the technology and fashion industries is going to look like. (Though Emma Watson\u2019s Calvin Klein bustier-pants-train combo made from recycled plastic bottles was not a bad idea.) Perhaps that\u2019s why a number of guests chose to eschew the references to code entirely and to opt instead for what seemed like classic costume drama.\nCorsets made a notable appearance; so did capes. There were assorted princess styles on Kate Bosworth and Zoe Saldana in Dolce & Gabbana; a Cinderella ball gown on Claire Danes that required both her husband Hugh Dancy and the designer Zac Posen to help when she needed to turn around; medieval royalty channeled by Florence Welch in Gucci and Nicole Kidman in Alexander McQueen; a Jane Eyre moment courtesy of Lauren Bush Lauren; and an inexplicable knickers-and-frock-coat combo from Monse on Sarah Jessica Parker, which looked like nothing so much as a garment borrowed from the \u201cHamilton\u201d stage.\nOh, and there was Tavi Gevinson\u2019s \u201cLittle House on the Prairie\u201d Coach look \u2014 in case anyone needed a reminder of the good old days before devices changed everything.\nThe barbell effect between old and tron was so extreme, it was something of a relief to find the other big trend of the evening was white, set by the event\u2019s chairwoman, Anna Wintour, in Chanel and then modeled by everyone from Jennifer Hudson (in frothy H&M) to Rosie Huntington-Whiteley (in minimal Ralph Lauren), which served as something of a palate cleanser between entrances.\nFor that, see also Zendaya\u2019s sleek one-sleeved gold Michael Kors, Kerry Washington\u2019s jazzy black Marc Jacobs, and the sea of classic black tuxes on most of the men. Zayn Malik (in Versace armor) and Jeremy Scott (in a Swarovski crystal studded skeleton tux) being the few exceptions, and Idris Elba and Tom Hiddleston, both in tails, particularly swish.\nIn the end, however, it was the number of short dresses that was the real surprise. Though Alicia Vikander\u2019s Louis Vuitton red leather breastplate and silk apron combo was a little confusing, the molded navy satin tunic over a black miniskirt on Michelle Williams was cool; ditto Zo\u00eb Kravitz\u2019s Valentino mini and Kate Mara\u2019s above-the-knee chain-mail Paco Rabanne.\nThe idea that a woman could get dressed up and stretch her legs too? That\u2019s a genuine advance.", "date": "May 3, 2016", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/03/fashion/fashion-met-gala.html", "tags": "like runway \u2018 something moment dress silver little gala reviewing \u201d machina vs. manus idea also met"}
