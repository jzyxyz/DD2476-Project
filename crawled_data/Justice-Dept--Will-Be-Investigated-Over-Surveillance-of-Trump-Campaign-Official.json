{"title": "Justice Dept. Will Be Investigated Over Surveillance of Trump Campaign Official", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Justice Department\u2019s inspector general, facing increasing political pressure from Republicans in Congress and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, said on Wednesday that his office would investigate the surveillance of a former Trump campaign official.\nThe announcement came amid a stream of attacks in recent months from the White House and Republican lawmakers seeking to undermine the special counsel\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the presidential election.\nThe inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, said he would examine whether law enforcement officials complied with the law and departmental policies in seeking permission from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to wiretap the former campaign adviser, Carter Page. Law enforcement officials had long had concerns that Mr. Page, a former investment banker based in Moscow, was acting as a Russian agent.\nRepublicans have seized on details about the court-ordered surveillance of Mr. Page as evidence that the Justice Department abused its authority in the Russia investigation. Mr. Horowitz did not name Mr. Page in his announcement.\nMr. Horowitz said he would also review what the Justice Department and the F.B.I. knew at the time about a former British spy and longtime F.B.I. source, Christopher Steele, who provided information about Mr. Page that was included in the surveillance application.\nRepublicans on Capitol Hill welcomed the decision but acknowledged that it fell short of demands by three Republican committee chairmen that the Justice Department appoint a second special counsel to investigate the accusations of surveillance abuses.\n\u201cThis is not a substitute for a special counsel to investigate this and other matters,\u201d said Representative Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, adding that the inspector general\u2019s office \u201cdoes not have authority to compel witness interviews, including from past employees, so its investigation will be limited in scope in comparison to a special counsel investigation.\u201d\nDemocrats feared that the investigation would further politicize a Justice Department that seems intent on appeasing President Trump. But they said they were confident that the review would confirm that the department and the F.B.I. had acted properly.\n\u201cAny objective review of these claims should tell us what we already know \u2014 that the F.B.I. was right, that there was sufficient evidence to continue investigating certain Trump campaign officials for their connections to the Russian government, and that the Republicans are desperate to distract from that investigation,\u201d said Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee.\nMr. Horowitz\u2019s office is in the final stages of another high-profile investigation studying several contentious decisions made at the F.B.I. and Justice Department during the 2016 presidential campaign. Findings from one piece of that investigation prompted the firing this month of the former F.B.I. deputy director, Andrew G. McCabe. Mr. Horowitz is expected to release a broader report on his entire review in the coming weeks.\nThe decision punctuated a year of attacks by Mr. Trump on the Justice Department and the special counsel investigation. Mr. McCabe, who as a former top F.B.I. official is a potential witness in the inquiry, insisted he was fired in an effort to discredit any testimony he might give.\nThe debate over the surveillance of Mr. Page exploded into public view in January when Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee revealed that they had assembled a classified memo accusing law enforcement leaders of abusing their power to spy on Mr. Page.\nThe document\u2019s chief claim was that the officials repeatedly used unsubstantiated Democratic-funded opposition research from Mr. Steele to obtain the surveillance warrant without adequately explaining to the judge the source of the information.\nMr. Trump declassified the memo over the objections of the F.B.I., which said it had \u201cgrave concerns\u201d over its accuracy, a rare public break from the White House. Once it was released, Mr. Trump enthusiastically trumpeted it as evidence that the Russia investigation had been concocted to smear him politically.\nDemocrats on the committee countered with a memo of their own \u2014 one the president declined to declassify \u2014 offering a point-by-point refutation of the Republican document and blasting it as an intentionally misleading attempt to undermine the Russia investigation. They said law enforcement officials acted properly in seeking permission to spy on Mr. Page.\nFormer career prosecutors said that the accusations of surveillance abuse had eroded trust in the Justice Department.\n\u201cThis is a continuation of a coordinated effort to discredit the special counsel\u2019s work through political attacks on career public servants in the F.B.I.,\u201d said Christopher Hunter, a former F.B.I. agent and federal prosecutor who left the Justice Department last year. \u201cSow disinformation, discredit the F.B.I. and the Justice Department in the minds of our own American citizens, all to undermine the special counsel and create an environment of confusion and doubt about the legitimacy of the special counsel\u2019s work \u2014 that\u2019s what Russian intelligence would do to destabilize our society, yet that\u2019s what\u2019s being done by our own government officials and their collaborators.\u201d\nMr. Sessions has tried to strike a balance between appeasing Mr. Trump and other conservatives assailing the Justice Department without alienating the 113,000 or so people who work under him. After the Republican congressional memo was released, he said that \u201cno department is perfect\u201d and that the Justice Department would address lawmakers\u2019 concerns.\nBut House Republicans grew frustrated with how the department was handling their concerns over a variety of issues including the surveillance of Mr. Page, the firing of Mr. McCabe and the investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state.\nIn a letter last week to the deputy attorney general, Mr. Goodlatte said that the department was moving too slowly and he issued a subpoena last week demanding that officials turn over documents related to those issues.\nThe Justice Department said in a letter sent Tuesday to Mr. Goodlatte that it would work \u201cto enhance the rate of productions,\u201d and that it would schedule a meeting with the committee and the F.B.I. to discuss how the department would further respond to the request.\nChristopher A. Wray, the director of the F.B.I., said in a news release that he had doubled the number of employees assigned to expedite the request for documents, with a total of 54 people working in shifts from 8 a.m. to midnight.", "date": "March 28, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/28/us/politics/justice-department-carter-page-surveillance.html", "tags": "f.b.i investigation investigated department former justice trump dept campaign official page surveillance"}
