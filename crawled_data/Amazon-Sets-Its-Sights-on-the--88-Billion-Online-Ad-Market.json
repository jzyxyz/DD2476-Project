{"title": "Amazon Sets Its Sights on the $88 Billion Online Ad Market", "content": "Verizon doesn\u2019t sell its mobile phones or wireless plans over Amazon. Nor does it offer Fios, its high-speed internet service. But Verizon does advertise on Amazon.\nOn Black Friday last year, when millions of online shoppers took to Amazon in search of deals, a Verizon ad for a Google Pixel 2 phone \u2014 buy one and get a second one half off \u2014 could be seen blazing across Amazon\u2019s home page. And on July 16, what Amazon calls Prime Day, an event with special deals for its Prime customers, Verizon again ran a variety of ads and special offers for Amazon shoppers, like a mix-and-match unlimited service plan.\nAmazon, which has already reshaped and dominated the online retail landscape, is quickly gathering momentum in a new, highly profitable arena: online advertising, where it is rapidly emerging as a major competitor to Google and Facebook.\nThe push by the giant online retailer means consumers \u2014 even Prime customers, who pay $119 a year for access to free shipping as well as streaming music, video and discounts \u2014 are likely to be confronted by ads in places where they didn\u2019t exist before.\nIn late August, some gamers were angered when Twitch, a video game streaming service acquired by Amazon in 2014, said it would soon no longer be ad-free for Prime members unless consumers paid an additional $8.99 a month for a premium service called Twitch Turbo.\nAmazon derives the bulk of its annual revenue, forecast to be $235 billion this year, from its e-commerce business, selling everything from books to lawn furniture. Amazon is also a leader in the cloud computing business, with Amazon Web Services, which accounts for around 11 percent of its revenue but more than half of its operating income. But in the company\u2019s most recent financial results, it was a category labeled \u201cother\u201d that caught the attention of many analysts. It mostly consists of revenue from selling banner, display and keyword search-driven ads known as \u201csponsored products.\u201d That category surged by about 130 percent to $2.2 billion in the first quarter, compared with the same period in 2017.\nThose numbers are a pittance for Google and Facebook, which make up more than half of the $88 billion digital ad market. But they come with big and troubling implications for those two giants.\nMuch of online advertising relies on imprecise algorithms that govern where marketing messages appear, and what impact they have on actual sales. Here, Amazon has a big advantage over its competitors. Thanks to its wealth of data and analytics on consumer shopping habits, it can put ads in front of people when they are more likely to be hunting for specific products and to welcome them as suggestions rather than see them as intrusions.\nAmazon is gaining in advertising when the public perception of Google and Facebook has soured. In addition, some advertisers have yet to return to YouTube, a growing ad channel for Google, after brands like AT&T were found appearing adjacent to videos that promoted racism or terrorism.\n\u201cGoogle and Facebook have been slow to create the standards that advertisers want to see,\u201d said Collin Colburn, an analyst at the research and advisory firm Forrester. \u201cThey are concerned about what sort of content their ads are going to be placed next to.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cAmazon is different because it has a much more controlled environment on its e-commerce site where the products are being sold, and Amazon\u2019s reach into the rest of the World Wide Web is pretty small.\u201d\nAmazon has sold some forms of advertising for years, including sponsored product listings tied to search keywords on its site, and ads on properties it owns like IMDb and Zappos. The company will also sell advertising spots on the Thursday-night National Football League games it live-streams to Prime customers this fall.\nBut some analysts who follow the company closely say Amazon is now focusing more on advertising, rapidly hiring and building out its capabilities in a business with high profit margins for Google and Facebook.\nIn turn, brands are increasingly recognizing Amazon\u2019s vast customer reach, particularly to its more than 100 million Prime subscribers. In a study conducted last summer by Catalyst, the search and social media marketing company, only 15 percent of the 250 brands marketers polled felt they were making the most out of advertising on Amazon\u2019s platform, and 63 percent of the companies already advertising there said they planned to increase their budget in the coming year.\nMany big brands that sell products on Amazon have increased their advertising on the site this year, including General Mills, Hershey and Unilever, according to an analysis of display ads by the research firm Gartner L2.\nBut the bigger surprise is the increase in advertising on Amazon by companies, like Verizon, AT&T and the insurer Geico, that don\u2019t directly sell any product or service on the site. In the first half of 2018, Geico ran six times as many display ads as it did during the same period last year, according to Oweise Khazi, associate director of Amazon IQ research at Gartner L2. (Geico declined to comment.)\nVerizon said the reason for its increased advertising spending on Amazon was simple: It\u2019s where the shoppers are.\n\u201cThey have people who are in a shopping mind-set, so that\u2019s valuable for Verizon to be seen as a resource within that mind-set,\u201d said John Nitti, the chief media officer at Verizon.\nThanks to the vast amount of data Amazon collects from its customers, it can target ads not only to basic demographics \u2014 say, women over the age of 35 \u2014 but to a more precise segment of customers who are likely to be shopping for cellphones or barbecue grills.\nAmazon is not just selling ads online. For Verizon, the opportunities to advertise over Amazon may increase as the e-commerce giant continues to build its internal media group and opens new advertising spots on various platforms or devices. Verizon, for instance, will soon be running a test: It will put Fios advertisements on Amazon packages being delivered to ZIP codes where Verizon offers the service.\nIn many cases, the advertising dollars that are moving to Amazon are being diverted from other digital players.\nLast year, the jeans maker Levi Strauss & Company shifted some of its advertising spending away from YouTube to Amazon, where it sharply increased its use of display ads, according to a May report by Gartner L2. In doing so, Levi\u2019s increased the brand\u2019s visibility in Google searches, driving shoppers to an Amazon page with Levi\u2019s merchandise, the research firm said.\nIn an emailed statement, a spokeswoman for Levi\u2019s said the company had increased its marketing investment across all channels, including television, traditional digital and newer digital platforms, including Amazon.\nFor some brands, the increased spending is most likely directly linked to increased competition on Amazon\u2019s platform from Amazon itself. As Amazon introduces more of its own private-label goods, many companies are expanding their advertising spending to raise the visibility of their products.\nOn a recent afternoon, a consumer who typed \u201ccereal\u201d into the search bar of Amazon\u2019s browser would first see an ad for JoyBol, followed by similar ads for General Mills\u2019 Corn Chex and Cinnamon Toast Crunch. But just below those ads, in a box labeled \u201cTop Rated From Our Brands,\u201d a number of cereals from 365 Everyday Value were featured. That is the private label of the grocer Whole Foods, which Amazon acquired in 2017.\nGeneral Mills declined to comment.\nKellogg Company, which faces much of the same competition, said it had been generally shifting advertising dollars toward digital platforms.\n\u201cWith Amazon\u2019s platform now being a leader in many elements of advertising \u2014 including, for many categories, search \u2014 it makes sense for part of those ad dollars to be allocated there,\u201d said Monica McGurk, Kellogg\u2019s chief revenue and e-commerce officer, in an emailed response to questions.\nBut for Kellogg\u2019s, what sets advertising on Amazon\u2019s platform apart from others, like Google or Twitter, is the online retailer\u2019s data.\n\u201cWe can reach the right consumer at the right time using their wealth of data to target,\u201d Ms. McGurk said. \u201cOther traditional digital platforms do not have the level of purchase data that Amazon has on their customers.\u201d\nAnalysts say some brands, however, particularly those whose products now face competition from Amazon private-label goods, remain reluctant to advertise on the e-commerce giant\u2019s platform.\n\u201cI do hear some brands saying, \u2018We don\u2019t want to work with Amazon too much because they\u2019re going to get too much information from us,\u201d said Will Margaritis, a vice president for e-commerce at the ad agency 360i. \u201cI feel like that\u2019s overthinking it. Amazon has enough data to understand everything about any category it wants to be in.\u201d", "date": "Sept. 3, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/03/business/media/amazon-digital-ads.html", "tags": "ads ad market billion \u201d online verizon brands sets sights advertising google amazon \u2014"}
