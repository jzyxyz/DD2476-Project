{"title": "Kentucky Just Made It Harder For Poor People To Get Health Care", "content": "The Trump administration on Friday told Kentucky it can go ahead with its controversial Medicaid overhaul \u2015 an initiative that would reduce benefits, require some beneficiaries to work, and generally make it more difficult for people to stay on the program.\nAdministration officials and their Kentucky counterparts have portrayed the plan as a way to improve the health of low-income residents and encourage self-sufficiency among poor but able-bodied adults.\u00a0\u201cThe result will be a transformational improvement in the overall health of our people and will provide a model for other states to follow,\u201d Matt Bevin, the state\u2019s Republican governor, said at a press conference\u00a0Friday.\nBut there\u2019s scant evidence that Kentucky\u2019s changes will have the effects that Bevin and his allies are promising. In fact, of the roughly 95,000 people expected to lose coverage, some will almost surely be people who are working \u2015 or have reasons why they can\u2019t work \u2015 but who failed to satisfy the new system\u2019s paperwork requirements.\nAlmost by definition, the people likely to lose coverage already have some combination of financial and medical problems, and without coverage, both are likely to get worse. It\u2019s not clear how much this worries Bevin and his allies in Washington \u2015 or whether it worries them at all.\nIn the new scheme, most working-age adults in Kentucky would have to demonstrate that they have spent at least 80 hours a month working or engaged in employment-related activities, like searching for a job or performing community service. Many would also have to pay premiums, of up to $15 a month.\nAnyone who does not pay their premiums or submit paperwork to show their eligibility would lose their coverage and would not be able to reapply for six months, although people who don\u2019t pay premiums could restore coverage by completing a financial literacy course (the details of which aren\u2019t yet clear).\nThe Kentucky initiative also eliminates a transportation benefit, designed to get poor people to the doctor or hospital when they don\u2019t have the means to do so.\u00a0And it ends \u201cretroactive\u201d eligibility, under which Medicaid covers bills from the past three months for people who sign up for Medicaid only after they\u2019ve had a medical episode that landed them in the hospital.\nKentucky\u2019s proposal is likely to prompt legal challenges. If it survives, then the result will almost certainly be a smaller Medicaid program. Both the state and the federal government would likely end up spending less money than they would otherwise. But fewer people would be on Medicaid: The number of beneficiaries would drop by roughly 95,000 within five years, according to official state estimates.\nBy comparison, Kentucky\u2019s total Medicaid enrollment \u2015 including kids on the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program \u2015 is about 1.25 million right now, according to official statistics.\nIn theory, the new requirements would not affect children, the elderly, pregnant women, primary caregivers or the \u201cmedically frail,\u201d because Kentucky\u2019s proposal explicitly exempts them. But those categories are narrower than they might seem, experts warned Friday as they pored over the final proposal and checked it against previous versions. (Every analyst studying it has warned that their conclusions are still a little tentative.)\n\u201cMedically frail,\u201d for example, doesn\u2019t appear to include people with serious chronic diseases that make jobs difficult to find and keep. And the new paperwork requirements will be difficult for some people to satisfy \u2015 because they can\u2019t get the right documentation, for example, or because overwhelmed state offices won\u2019t be responsive to questions. \nAs a result, some people who remain eligible for Medicaid will almost surely end up losing coverage anyway. It\u2019s happened that way before, when states introduced work requirements for food stamps and straightforward cash assistance.\n\u201cThe policy could allow many people to fall through the cracks, including those with chronic health conditions, and those with mental health or substance use disorders such as opioid addiction,\u201d Hannah Katch, a senior analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, told HuffPost. \u201cAnd for those who are eligible for an exemption, the policy could still require someone who is medically frail, for example, to jump through administrative hoops to demonstrate that they are eligible for an exemption.\u201d\nKentucky isn\u2019t the only state that wants to impose these kinds of restrictions on Medicaid. Nearly a dozen states have similar requests sitting in Washington, awaiting approval from the Trump administration that they\u2019re almost certain to get. More could follow soon.\nFriday\u2019s approval of Kentucky\u2019s new plan\u00a0came one day after the Trump administration announced\u00a0it would approve work requirements. This represented a considerable policy shift. Previously, the Obama administration had rejected such requests, arguing that work requirements violate Medicaid\u2019s guarantee of health care for poor people. These are the same arguments that advocates for the poor are likely to make if and when they sue to block the changes.\nTrump administration officials, like their Kentucky counterparts, know this. In their letter approving the proposal, they previewed their defense by making the same argument they did on Thursday \u2015 that requiring able-bodied Medicaid recipients to work would improve their health outcomes and help them become familiar with the way private health insurance works. That is why, the administration said, it was within its rights to approve Kentucky\u2019s request as a \u201cdemonstration project.\u201d\nBut there\u2019s very little evidence to suggest Kentucky\u2019s overhaul will improve health outcomes, and quite a lot of evidence to suggest it will actually worsen them. Multiple studies, some of them focusing on Kentucky specifically, have shown that giving people Medicaid makes them healthier and more financially secure, which in turn makes it easier for them to find and hold on to jobs.\nThere is also little reason to think these changes would make Kentucky\u2019s Medicaid program more efficient. On the contrary, new requirements such as checking to make sure people have jobs will inevitably require more administrative work \u2015 not just for the people who want Medicaid, but for the state government as well.\nRetroactive eligibility \u2015 a key if underappreciated provision of Medicaid in most states \u2015 doesn\u2019t simply help low-income people avoid crippling medical debt. It also helps finance the operation of safety net hospitals. Ending it, as Kentucky plans to do, would likely hurt both. When another state, Indiana, experimented with having Medicaid recipients contribute toward the cost of their Medicaid, large numbers did not, and they ended up losing coverage as a result.\nThose are just some of the reasons to think the real motivation for these changes has little to do with health outcomes, efficiency or the economy as a whole. A more plausible explanation is that Republican officials \u2015 including Bevin and Seema Verma, the Trump administration official in charge of Medicaid \u2015 think too many able-bodied adults are on the program. In fact, Verma has said this explicitly before.\nMany Americans \u2015 quite possibly most \u2015 would have no problem linking Medicaid and work. But nearly 80 percent of people on Medicaid are already in families where somebody is employed, and nearly 60 percent work themselves, according to data from\u00a0the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. And of those who don\u2019t work,\u00a0most are in school or caring for a family member, or have a medical condition that they say prevents them from working. Other studies\u00a0have yielded similar findings.\nThat all of this should be happening in Kentucky is ironic. Although a relatively conservative state, smack in the heart of what now qualifies as Trump country, Kentucky enthusiastically embraced the Affordable Care Act when it became law. It took advantage of new federal money to expand its Medicaid program, so it would be available to all people with incomes below or just above the poverty line.\nBetween 2013 and 2016, the share of Kentucky\u2019s residents without insurance fell from 20.4 percent to 7.8 percent. That was the single biggest drop of any state in the country. \nBut that change took place while Steve Beshear, a Democratic governor enthusiastic about helping poor people get health insurance, was in charge. Bevin, his successor and a loud critic of \u201cObamacare,\u201d campaigned on a promise to roll back the expansion. Although he backed off that promise \u2015 perhaps because many of those who supported him would have been among the hundreds of thousands losing coverage \u2015 he has continued to suggest Medicaid needs radical changes because, he says, it encourages dependency.\nBevin has also made a threat\u00a0that if he can\u2019t get his way on the work requirement and other changes, he will go ahead and roll back the expansion after all. That would leave a much larger number of Kentucky residents, perhaps approaching half a million, without health insurance.\nCORRECTION:\u00a0A previous version of this story mistakenly suggested that \u201cpresumptive\u201d eligibility is another term for \u201cretroactive\u201d eligibility. In fact, they are two separate things, and Kentucky\u2019s overhaul repeals only the latter.", "date": "\n01/12/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-kentucky-medicaid-work-requirement_n_5a591c2ee4b03c4189658d23", "tags": "people work kentucky poor medicaid would \u201d \u2015 state get made care harder health"}
