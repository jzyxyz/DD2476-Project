{"title": "Victor or Victim? Trump\u2019s Changing Response to Mueller Report", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The day after the special counsel delivered his report to the Justice Department, President Trump was ecstatic. He claimed vindication. When he walked into the dining room of his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, according to someone there, guests rose to their feet to give him a standing ovation.\nA month later, the president\u2019s view of the report by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has grown darker. While Mr. Trump once welcomed it as \u201ctotal exoneration,\u201d he has spent the last few days assailing it as a \u201ctotal \u2018hit job\u2019\u201d produced by \u201ctrue Trump Haters, including highly conflicted Bob Mueller himself.\u201d\n\u201cNow we\u2019re finished with it, and I thought after two years we\u2019d be finished with it,\u201d he told reporters on the South Lawn of the White House on Wednesday after a morning of tweeting about Mr. Mueller\u2019s report. Declaring that \u201cit\u2019s enough,\u201d he vowed again to resist all subpoenas by House Democrats seeking to investigate further.\nHis bitterness rarely seems far from the surface. When Mr. Trump showed up in Atlanta later in the day to deliver a speech on opioid abuse, he diverted from the script at a line about stopping the drug industry from \u201crigging the system.\u201d He grew animated. \u201cI know all about the rigging the system because I had the system rigged on me,\u201d he said. \u201cI think you know what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d\nIn Mr. Trump\u2019s world, there is a fine line between victor and victim. The president often veers back and forth, eager to be seen by others as the former even as he sees himself as the latter. To Mr. Trump, winning is always the goal, whether it be in business, politics, policy or even investigations, but even when he is on top, he lapses into anger and resentment, convinced that he has been unfairly treated and determined to strike back.\nAs a result, Mr. Trump\u2019s message about Mr. Mueller\u2019s findings has turned increasingly incongruous: When the report says investigators established no conspiracy between Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia in 2016 and makes no allegation of obstruction of justice by the president, it is right on the money. When it offers unflattering descriptions of the president\u2019s actions and refuses to exonerate him on obstruction, the report is dead wrong.\n\u201cHe accepts the ultimate conclusion, in which there is no evidence of criminality or evidence sufficient to draw a conclusion,\u201d Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of the president\u2019s lawyers, said in an interview.\n\u201cHowever, we don\u2019t accept \u2014 he doesn\u2019t, I don\u2019t, Jay doesn\u2019t \u2014 a lot of the factual statements made, inferences, questionable material that\u2019s put out there,\u201d he added, referring to Jay Sekulow, another lawyer for Mr. Trump. \u201cWe don\u2019t accept that\u2019s by any means all true and we certainly don\u2019t accept that it\u2019s correctly interpreted. That\u2019s what he\u2019s objecting to.\u201d\nTo be sure, the president\u2019s Democratic critics have likewise chosen to interpret the report to suit their interests, focusing on its depiction of a president willing to profit politically off Russian assistance during the election and intent on thwarting the investigation that followed. Even though Mr. Mueller made no allegations of criminality, some Democrats found enough disturbing detail in the report to advocate impeachment hearings.\nThat has clearly unsettled Mr. Trump, who while saying he is not the least bit concerned about impeachment has been aggressively pushing back against the prospect in recent days. To the extent that he anticipated that Mr. Mueller\u2019s report would clear him, he has expressed frustration that it is still being used against him.\n\u201cWhen that report came out, a lot of people felt relieved,\u201d said Christopher Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media and a friend who saw Mr. Trump in Florida last weekend. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think anybody was prepared. I was shocked by the coverage, especially on MSNBC, through the weekend. It was just impeachment, nonstop.\n\u201cI am sure the president is seeing the same kind of coverage I\u2019m seeing,\u201d he added. \u201cIf you go through this, you cooperate, you\u2019re cleared, and in this country they still say you committed some sort of crime.\u201d\nThrough a long history in the public eye, Mr. Trump has toggled between self-portrayals of greatness and grievance. He claims to have won even when he has not, and when he loses, he says he was ripped off in some way, even if imagined.\nHe repeatedly exaggerated the scope of his Electoral College victory, claiming it was one of the biggest when it was not. And he explained away his loss in the popular vote by asserting falsely that he actually won that, too, but for millions of people who supposedly voted illegally for Hillary Clinton.\n\u201cHe can be a victor when that\u2019s convenient and he can be a victim when that\u2019s convenient. And if things don\u2019t work out, then he\u2019s covered,\u201d said Gwenda Blair, a biographer of Mr. Trump and his family. \u201cHe\u2019s always going to come out on top, but sometimes you come out on top by saying you won and sometimes you come out on top because you were cheated.\u201d\nMr. Trump\u2019s initial reaction to Mr. Mueller\u2019s report was colored by the selective summary offered by his own attorney general, William P. Barr, who at first disclosed only the special counsel\u2019s bottom-line conclusions, then took nearly four weeks to review the 448-page document before releasing a redacted version last week.\nWhen the report came out, much of the focus was not on the conclusions, which were by then four weeks old, but on the voluminous details made public for the first time. While Mr. Mueller found no criminal conspiracy with Russia, his report made clear that Mr. Trump and his team shared the interests of Moscow\u2019s agents in trying to bring down Mrs. Clinton. And Mr. Mueller outlined nearly a dozen episodes that he said could be considered obstruction of justice even though he rendered no judgment himself.\nMr. Trump was unsure how to take the report. In just a half-hour on Monday, he offered two strikingly different perspectives, one promoting the report and the next attacking its authors.\n\u201c\u2018A very exculpatory section of the Mueller Report: NO CONSPIRACY, COORDINATION or COLLUSION with the Trump Campaign and the Russians. You can\u2019t be more clear than that!\u2019\u201d he wrote on Twitter, quoting Gregg Jarrett, a Fox News analyst and author of \u201cThe Russia Hoax.\u201d\nThen, 27 minutes later, Mr. Trump wrote: \u201cIsn\u2019t it amazing that the people who were closest to me, by far, and knew the Campaign better than anyone, were never even called to testify before Mueller. The reason is that the 18 Angry Democrats knew they would all say \u2018NO COLLUSION\u2019 and only very good things!\u201d\nBy Wednesday morning, he was trying to marry those two thoughts into a single message \u2014 both embracing the report and trashing it. \u201cThe Mueller Report, despite being written by Angry Democrats and Trump Haters, and with unlimited money behind it ($35,000,000), didn\u2019t lay a glove on me,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI DID NOTHING WRONG.\u201d\nIn subsequent tweets, he tried again to claim victory amid his victimhood, casting the investigation as a contest in which he prevailed. In terms rarely used regarding a criminal investigation, he asserted that \u201cWe waited for Mueller and WON\u201d and denounced \u201cthe Witch Hunt, which I have already won.\u201d\nMr. Trump has also switched assessments of Mr. Mueller himself. After Mr. Barr\u2019s letter came out, when the president felt buoyant about the investigation\u2019s conclusions, he said the special counsel had acted honorably. By this week, he was retweeting a year-old post by a Republican congressman saying that Mr. Mueller\u2019s \u201cdisreputable, twisted history speaks to the character of the man placed in a position to attempt to legalize a coup against a lawfully-elected President.\u201d\nMr. Mueller has done nothing to change in between. What changed was the assessment of the special counsel\u2019s findings, which became more threatening to the president.\nFriends said Mr. Trump was responding to that shifting conversation. \u201cThey\u2019re really hitting him hard on the shows,\u201d Mr. Ruddy said. \u201cI would see his comments as a reaction. He likes to respond. He doesn\u2019t like to take anything sitting down.\u201d\nAnd so he is standing up to the report he once welcomed.", "date": "April 24, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/24/us/politics/mueller-report-trump-administration.html", "tags": "victim changing report \u201c even trump victor response said special mueller"}
