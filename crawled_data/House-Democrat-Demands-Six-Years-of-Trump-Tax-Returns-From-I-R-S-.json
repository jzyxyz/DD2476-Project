{"title": "House Democrat Demands Six Years of Trump Tax Returns From I.R.S.", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, using a little-known provision in the federal tax code, formally requested on Wednesday that the I.R.S. hand over six years of President Trump\u2019s personal and business tax returns, starting what is likely to be a momentous fight with his administration.\nRepresentative Richard E. Neal, Democrat of Massachusetts, hand-delivered a two-page letter laying out the request to Charles P. Rettig, the Internal Revenue Service commissioner, ending months of speculation about when he would do so and almost certainly prompting a legal challenge from the Trump administration.\nResponding to questions from reporters in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump suggested that he would fight the request because, he said, he was being audited.\n\u201cI guess when you have a name, you are audited, but until such time as I\u2019m not under audit I would not be inclined to do that,\u201d he said.\n[Read Mr. Neal\u2019s letter to the I.R.S. commissioner.]\nThe move by Mr. Neal came as other panels controlled by House Democrats were flexing their muscles. The House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday morning authorized its chairman to use a subpoena to try to force the Justice Department to give Congress a full copy of the special counsel\u2019s report and all of the underlying evidence used to reach his conclusions on Russian interference in the 2016 election.\nAnd the chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee said that he would soon ask for a vote on a subpoena of his own to compel Mazars USA, an accounting firm tied to the president, to produce a decade\u2019s worth of Mr. Trump\u2019s financial records.\n\u201cThey have told us that they will provide the information pretty much when they have a subpoena,\u201d the chairman, Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, told reporters. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll get them a subpoena.\u201d\nUnlike the chairmen of other committees, Mr. Neal is not relying on a subpoena or standard congressional processes. Instead, he is invoking an authority enshrined in the tax code granted only to the tax-writing committees in Congress that gives the chairmen of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee the power to request tax information on any filer.\nMr. Neal gave the agency until April 10 to comply with the request, and if he receives the information, he will then confidentially review it with his committee staff.\nThe provision, which dates in some form to the Teapot Dome scandal of Warren G. Harding\u2019s administration, at least on its face gives the Trump administration little room to decline a request like Mr. Neal\u2019s. It only says that the Treasury secretary \u201cshall\u201d furnish the information.\n\u201cPresident Trump is the first president in nearly a half century to break precedent and refuse to voluntarily release his tax returns,\u201d said Representative Dan Kildee, Democrat of Michigan and a member of the Ways and Means Committee. \u201cThe president is the only person who can sign bills into law, and the public deserves to know whether the president\u2019s personal financial interests affect his public decision making.\u201d\nThe Treasury Department and the I.R.S. did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nBut Democrats anticipate that the Trump administration will object to the request and force the matter into the courts, where its adjudication could take months or longer. Though the provision \u2014 No. 6103 in the tax code \u2014 is invoked frequently by the committee, there is little precedent for using it to view the returns of a president who has not invited the scrutiny.\nRepublicans have vigorously argued against the request, saying that whatever justification Democrats produce will belie their true intent: to fish for information that could embarrass the president politically.\nRepresentative Kevin Brady of Texas, the top Republican on the Ways and Means Committee, called the request \u201can abuse of the tax-writing committees\u2019 statutory authority.\u201d\n\u201cWeaponizing our nation\u2019s tax code by targeting political foes sets a dangerous precedent and weakens Americans\u2019 privacy rights,\u201d Mr. Brady said in a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. \u201cAs you know, by law all Americans have a fundamental right to the privacy of the personal information found in their tax returns.\u201d\nDefying modern presidential norms, Mr. Trump has refused since he became a candidate for president to release any of his tax returns. Democrats suspect the tax information could provide clues to wrongdoing by Mr. Trump, and they made getting the documents one of their top oversight priorities when they reclaimed control of the House in January.\n[A New York Times investigation showed that the president engaged in suspect tax schemes as he reaped riches from his father.]\nMr. Neal said he was making the request as part of his committee\u2019s oversight of \u201cthe extent to which the I.R.S. audits and enforces the federal tax laws against a president.\u201d Under I.R.S. policy, the personal tax returns of presidents and vice presidents are supposed to be automatically audited each year. Mr. Neal said the committee was considering legislation related to the issue.\n\u201cI take the authority to make this request very seriously, and I approach it with the utmost care and respect,\u201d Mr. Neal said in a statement. \u201cThis request is about policy, not politics; my preparations were made on my own track and timeline, entirely independent of other activities in Congress and the administration.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cI trust that in this spirit, the I.R.S. will comply with federal law and furnish me with the requested documents in a timely manner.\u201d\nIn addition to Mr. Trump\u2019s personal returns for 2013 to 2018, Mr. Neal requested returns for Mr. Trump\u2019s trust and seven other core Trump business entities that control scores of other Trump operations, including his golf club in Bedminster, N.J. He also asked the I.R.S. to share any information it had related to the entities, including whether they had been audited.\nLiberal Democrats have complained for weeks that Mr. Neal, 70 and a roll-up-your-sleeves legislator, was dragging his feet on making the request. They have organized events in his district, taken out advertisements and produced legal briefs meant to make a case that he should act and act quickly.\nMr. Neal said throughout that he was chiefly concerned with crafting a request, alongside the House general counsel and the Ways and Means Committee staff, that could withstand legal challenge.\n\u201cI am certain we are within our legitimate legislative, legal and oversight rights,\u201d he said on Wednesday.\nIn the Judiciary Committee, the chairman, Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, said he would not immediately issue the subpoena for the Mueller report. But the party-line vote won by Democrats who control the committee ratchets up pressure on Attorney General William P. Barr as he decides how much of the nearly 400-page report to share with lawmakers.\n\u201cI will give him time to change his mind,\u201d Mr. Nadler said in his opening statement. \u201cBut if we cannot reach an accommodation, then we will have no choice but to issue subpoenas for these materials.\u201d\nThe committee also approved subpoenas for five former White House aides who Democrats said were relevant to an investigation into possible obstruction of justice, abuse of power and corruption within the Trump administration.\nThey included Donald F. McGahn II, a former White House counsel; Stephen K. Bannon, the president\u2019s former chief strategist; Hope Hicks, a former White House communications director; Reince Priebus, the president\u2019s first chief of staff; and Annie Donaldson, a deputy of Mr. McGahn.", "date": "April 3, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/03/us/politics/mueller-report-subpoena-house.html", "tags": "tax \u201c committee president house trump returns neal democrat years six request demands i.r.s"}
