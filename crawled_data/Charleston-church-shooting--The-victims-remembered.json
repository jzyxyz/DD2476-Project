{"title": "Charleston church shooting: The victims remembered", "content": "On Wednesday in Charleston, South Carolina, nine churchgoers headed to Emanuel AME Church for bible study, a typical activity for the group. They were pastors, recent graduates, librarians, coaches and members of families, but a deadly shooting took their lives. Here is what we know about the nine victims.\nCynthia Hurd, 54, was a beloved employee of the Charleston County Public Library for 31 years.\n\"Cynthia was a tireless servant of the community who spent her life helping residents, making sure they had every opportunity for an education and personal growth,\" the library wrote in a post to its website on Thursday. \nThe library closed all of its locations on Thursday in her honour.\nA city council member said on Thursday that the branch of the Charleston library where Hurd worked was going to be re-named the Cynthia Hurd Regional Library, calling her a \"true public servant\". \nShe was known as a person dedicated to teaching and helping others read. She is survived by her husband Arthur, the Post and Courier reports.\nHer brother, former North Carolina state senator Malcom Graham, said it was a small comfort his sister died in the church she loved so much. She had been going to Emanuel AME Church every Sunday and Wednesday since her childhood.\nShe was looking forward to retirement and her 55th birthday, which would have been Sunday.\nSouth Carolina State Senator Clementa Pinckney was the church's pastor since 2010 and a well-known community leader. He was a married father of two.\nPinckney had been preaching since he was 13. He was considered a rising star of Democratic politics in a largely Republican state.\nEarlier this year, he lent his voice to a campaign for police to wear body cameras in the wake of the deadly officer-involved shooting of unarmed black man Walter Scott.\n\"I always felt God had called me to serve within the church because of what the church stands for,\" he told the Charleston Post and Courtier in 2010. \"This has always been home.\"\nPinckney served in South Carolina government since 1997. He attended Allen University in Columbia, South Carolina.\nRead more: Pastor lifted spirits\nSharonda Coleman-Singleton, a speech therapist, pastor and high school track coach, was a mother of three.\nMs Singleton was a track athlete at South Carolina State University, according to the Post and Courier.\nHer son Chris Singleton is a baseball player at Charleston Southern University.
