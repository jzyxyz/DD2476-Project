{"title": "North Korea Nuclear Deal Could Take \u2018Years,\u2019 Trump Suggests", "content": "President Trump said Wednesday that he has years to reach an agreement with North Korea to rid the country of nuclear weapons, reversing the position he took a year ago that Pyongyang had to disarm rapidly.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to get into the time game,\u201d he said at a news conference late in the day, after serving as chairman of a United Nations Security Council meeting on nuclear proliferation.\n\u201cI got all the time in the world,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI don\u2019t have to rush it.\u201d\nMr. Trump\u2019s statement came despite satellite photographs and other evidence that have led American intelligence agencies to conclude that North Korea continues to produce nuclear fuel and fabricate it into weapons. American officials estimate that the country now has between 20 and 60 nuclear weapons, and the number may be rising.\nBut Mr. Trump argued that the halt in nuclear and missile testing by North Korea \u2014 and a series of private letters exchanged with Kim Jong-un, the country\u2019s leader \u2014 had taken the urgency out of the disarmament issue.\n\u201cIf it takes two years, three years or five months,\u201d Mr. Trump said, suggesting that the timeline for North Korea to surrender its nuclear weapons was flexible.\nWhen Mr. Trump was running for office, he criticized his predecessors for letting North Korea continue to expand its arsenal while engaging the United States in lengthy and ultimately fruitless negotiations.\nBut on Wednesday, Mr. Trump suggested that the North had been defanged, contending that his diplomatic efforts with Mr. Kim were succeeding where others had failed.\n\u201cIf I wasn\u2019t elected, you would have had a war\u201d with the North, Mr. Trump said.\nHe contended that in his private conversations with President Obama before taking office, Mr. Obama told him that the United States had been on the brink of war with North Korea.\n\u201cHe said to me that he was very close to going to war,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\nMr. Obama\u2019s aides say that while the former president had explored many military options, he concluded that the risks to South Korea, which shares the Korean Peninsula with the North, were simply too big.\nBut Mr. Trump said that relations between the two countries had turned around during his presidency, adding that he had received two letters from Mr. Kim, demonstrating \u201chis feelings for wanting to get this done.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re incredible letters,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cHe wants to make a deal. I want to make a deal.\u201d\nThe challenge for Mr. Trump is that he has yet to win a freeze on nuclear production and weapons from North Korea. Without that freeze, the country\u2019s arsenal could continue to expand, potentially creating an even larger problem \u2014 exactly what Mr. Trump criticized his predecessors for doing.\nMr. Trump has suggested that there is secret diplomacy underway between the two countries, but he has not said that it includes a halt in nuclear production, much less a surrender of the weapons the North has already amassed.\nMr. Trump argued that he had made no concessions to North Korea by engaging in diplomacy, and he defended his decision to suspend joint military exercises with South Korea as a cost-saving measure that benefited the United States.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t give anything,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Trump said. \u201cI gave nothing. What did I give?\u201d\nThe military exercises \u2014 \u201cI call them military games,\u201d Mr. Trump said \u2014 could be restarted at any time, he added.\n\u201cIf I told you what these games cost,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re saving a fortune.\u201d\nMr. Trump acknowledged that a deal to disarm North Korea might not be reached. But he was confident that it would.\n\u201cRight now, we\u2019re in a great position,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get into the time game.\u201d", "date": "Sept. 26, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/26/world/asia/trump-korea-nuclear-deal.html", "tags": "suggests \u2018 korea nuclear take years \u201d trump weapons could north \u2014 deal"}
