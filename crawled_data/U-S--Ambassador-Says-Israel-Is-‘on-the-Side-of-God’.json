Friedman said that Israel was gaining strength for two reasons.\nFirst, he said, the relationship between the two countries was growing \u201cstronger and stronger and stronger.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the second is that Israel has one secret weapon that not too many countries have,\u201d Mr. Friedman added. \u201cIsrael is on the side of God, and we don\u2019t underestimate that.\u201d\nThe remark reflected a common belief among evangelical Christians, but was also the latest sign of an anything but evenhanded approach to the conflict by the Trump administration.\nIn addition to moving the embassy to Jerusalem, a move seen as partial to Israel in the dispute over the city\u2019s sovereignty, the administration has made deep cuts in aid to the Palestinians and stopped referring to the West Bank as \u201coccupied.\u201d\nMr. Friedman seemed to acknowledge as much moments later, rattling off a litany of other moves the administration has made that broke with precedent in Israel\u2019s favor, including punishing the Palestinians by closing their diplomatic mission in Washington and merging the formerly independent Jerusalem consulate, which had exclusively dealt with the Palestinians, with the embassy.\nStill, the remark set off new howls of criticism, with Palestinians complaining that Mr. Friedman was representing the interests of Israel\u2019s right-wing government more than those of the United States. Even one of Mr. Friedman\u2019s predecessors called the statement out of bounds.\n\u201cAs the ambassador of the far-right Orthodox Jewish community in the United States, Friedman\u2019s comment makes sense,\u201d said Daniel C. Kurtzer, who was Washington\u2019s ambassador in Israel under both Republican and Democratic presidents. \u201cAs the supposed ambassador of the United States government and all its people, it is an extremely inappropriate comment.\u201d\nPalestinians were slack-jawed.\n\u201cWhere does that place the rest of the world?\u201d said Hanan Ashrawi, a veteran Palestinian negotiator and member of the Palestine Liberation Organization\u2019s executive committee. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it. I can\u2019t believe this extreme fundamentalist ideologue is an ambassador.\u201d\nMs. Ashrawi \u2014 who said that on Monday she had been denied a visa to the United States for the first time \u2014 noted that the event at which Mr. Friedman had made the remark, with its echoes of religious warfare, was held in a hotel a stone\u2019s throw from the walls of the Old City, where Crusaders and Muslims had slaughtered one another for centuries.\n\u201cThe last time we had people thinking that way in Palestine was in the Middle Ages, and look at what happened,\u201d Ms. Ashrawi said.\nSaeb Erekat, the P.L.O.\u2019s longtime chief negotiator, questioned the propriety of referring to God as a weapon at all. \u201cWhat ambassador Friedman is telling Palestinians, Christians and Muslims,\u201d he wrote on Twitter, was \u201cthat God is against them (or that they\u2019re enemies of God). This was never an American position.\u201d\nNo one has accused Mr. Friedman, who was Mr. Trump\u2019s longtime bankruptcy lawyer, of impartiality in his post, or even of the studied neutrality of career diplomats. Before being appointed he was a prominent supporter of and major donor to the Israeli settlement enterprise in the occupied West Bank, which most of the world considers illegal under international law.\nHe can also seem to invite charges that he is overly close to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel: Opening his remarks Tuesday night, he acknowledged Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s presence and joked that it had been mere days since they had seen each other, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s been difficult to be apart from you for so long.\u201d\nIn his speech, Mr. Friedman made light of predictions of violence over the move of the embassy to Jerusalem a year ago. \u201cIn the entire city of Jerusalem that day, I don\u2019t think more than 20 people got up to protest,\u201d he said. \u201cI think more people were unhappy about the food they were eating in various restaurants than they were about the move of the embassy to Jerusalem.\u201d\nHe acknowledged that \u201cthere was violence that day in Gaza\u201d \u2014 where Israeli soldiers killed about 60 Palestinians demonstrating along the border fence \u2014 but said it had \u201cnothing to do with the opening of the embassy.\u201d\nIn fact, the protests in Gaza had been mounted that day specifically with the intent of overshadowing the embassy ceremony.\nMr. Friedman also said that if he had his way, the United States would continue to push the envelope in its support for Israel. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in enough,\u201d he said.\nIn a riff about the ancient Jewish Temple, which many right-wing Jews want to rebuild atop the Temple Mount, Mr. Friedman, an Orthodox Jew, noted that inside it was an altar built on a ramp. To achieve a certain level of holiness, he said, \u201cyou have to keep pushing forward; there are consequences to stopping.\u201d He added: \u201cWe need to keep moving forward, keep moving up the ramp.\u201d", "date": "May 14, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/world/middleeast/us-ambassador-israel-god.html", "tags": "\u2018 mr. ambassador palestinians u.s. united states side israel \u201d god says jerusalem friedman"}
