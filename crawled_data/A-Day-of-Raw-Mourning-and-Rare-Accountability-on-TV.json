{"title": "A Day of Raw Mourning and Rare Accountability on TV", "content": "What makes teenagers amazing \u2014 or infuriating, if you\u2019re in an argument with one \u2014 is they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re not supposed to be able to do.\nThey haven\u2019t learned that being smart means being cynical about what you can accomplish. They haven\u2019t been hard-wired with platitudes and euphemisms. They haven\u2019t internalized a list of questions that are too na\u00efve or impolite to ask.\nAt CNN\u2019s town hall on gun violence Wednesday, \u201cStudents of Stoneman Douglas Demand Action,\u201d this resulted in something you rarely see on TV: accountability. A week after 17 people died in a mass school shooting in Parkland, Fla., a group of angry, grieving constituents was questioning public officials as if they worked for the public.\nIt\u2019s not unusual for news programming after a tragedy to be cathartic or argumentative \u2014 cable news can\u2019t resist emotion and conflict. But this was both at once, and that made it something remarkable.\nThe town hall, moderated by Jake Tapper, was part debate, part memorial (it ended with \u201cShine,\u201d a song written and sung by students), part public trial for the political and educational system.\nThe crowd of thousands, clearly favoring the gun regulations advocated by Stoneman Douglas student activists, howled and jeered at Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, and Dana Loesch, a spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association. One student condemned politicians for taking the N.R.A.\u2019s \u201cblood money.\u201d\nThe raw, sometimes heartbreaking exchanges didn\u2019t just involve students. Fred Guttenberg, the father of a slain student, told Mr. Rubio that his comments after the shooting had been \u201cpathetically weak.\u201d A teacher who said she had voted for Donald J. Trump spoke out against the president\u2019s suggestion that school faculty carry guns.\nBut it was the students who made it possible, by using their distinctive status as survivors of a tragedy to become the drivers of their story instead of its subjects.\nThey couldn\u2019t be told that it was disrespectful to the victims for them to bring up gun policy; they were among the victims, and the dead were their friends and teachers. They had the aura of ordinary nonpoliticians, but they were also digital-native media savants, organizing hashtag campaigns, planning protests, delivering speeches that went spectacularly viral and nimbly engaging detractors on social media.\nIt fell to Mr. Rubio, as the lone Republican senator at the town hall \u2014 and one highly rated by the N.R.A. \u2014 to grimly take much of the scolding. It wasn\u2019t just a conflict between liberalism and conservatism, it was a clash between the established dogma of the gun debate and a newly engaged, enraged audience.\nOne exchange in particular summed up this disconnect. Mr. Rubio was challenged by Mr. Guttenberg, who seemed to support a ban on weapons like the AR-15 that the shooter killed his daughter with. The problem, Mr. Rubio said, was that in order to eliminate every weapon with that sort of capability, \u201cYou would literally have to ban every semiautomatic rifle that\u2019s sold in America.\u201d\nThe crowd cheered, which did not seem to be the effect Mr. Rubio desired.\nMr. Rubio, after years of political argument, may have assumed that his answer was sufficient: You can\u2019t ban that many guns because \u2014 well, you just can\u2019t. Everybody knows it. It has been deemed outside the universe of practical solutions.\nSuddenly, Mr. Rubio\u2019s rehearsed comebacks wilted like a wizard\u2019s magic wand that had been transformed into a noodle. Pressed on whether he would reject campaign donations from the N.R.A., he kept repeating, \u201cThey buy into my agenda,\u201d to no avail.\nBut Mr. Rubio did get praise from his Senate colleague, Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida (who received a friendlier reception), for showing up. Florida\u2019s governor, Rick Scott (a Republican), declined.\nAlso invited was President Trump, who instead counterprogrammed the CNN special with a \u201clistening session\u201d earlier in the day at the White House, for survivors and family members from Parkland and other shootings.\nMr. Trump\u2019s forum was a more controlled and quiet one, including fewer calls for gun regulation, and more supporters of the president\u2019s positions. But by the standards of any other day, it would have been remarkable.\nLive on TV news, the president \u2014 accustomed to getting the first, last and middle words \u2014 sat largely quiet, holding a slip of handwritten notes (No. 5 read: \u201cI hear you\u201d) and asking survivors for their ideas and feelings.\nTheir pleas were less political, but anguished, even furious. \u201cIt should have been one school shooting, and we should have fixed it \u2014 and I\u2019m pissed,\u201d said Andrew Pollack, whose daughter was killed in Florida. It felt raw and volatile in the way that politician-constituent meetings usually are not, especially in the White House.\nWatching the session, I was reminded of the \u201carena\u201d TV specials that Roger Ailes staged for Richard Nixon during the 1968 campaign, as described in Joe McGinniss\u2019s \u201cThe Selling of the President 1968.\u201d\nThe idea was that depicting Mr. Nixon surrounded by questioners would show him heroically, regardless of his answers. \u201cNixon stood alone,\u201d McGinniss wrote, \u201cringed by forces which, if not hostile, were \u2014 to the viewer at least \u2014 unpredictable. There was a rush of sympathy; a desire \u2014 a need, even \u2014 to root.\u201d\nWith Mr. Trump, the aim may have been more to show a president not engaged in trying to defeat his questioners but listening to their answers. By Thursday, though, Mr. Trump was vociferously pushing the idea of arming teachers that he\u2019d spoken of warmly in the meeting.\nThis is the part of this essay where I am supposed to note that there have been times when the conversation around an issue seemed to shift \u2014 the Sandy Hook shootings, for instance \u2014 and then shifted back. That\u2019s what we expect from a smart take \u2014 a knowing cautiousness, informed by history.\nThat instinct is not inaccurate. But the last week of the Parkland students suggests that there is also value in not being too aware of what all the smart people know is impossible.", "date": "Feb. 22, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/22/arts/television/school-shooting-town-hall-cnn.html", "tags": "tv rubio rare \u201d one gun mourning raw students \u2014 day accountability"}
