All of his victims survived.\nHe first stabbed two students in a classroom with a hunting knife, before attacking a construction worker who tried to help them. Mohammed then ran outside and stabbed a university employee. \nA month later, a husband and wife killed 14 people at a staff training event in San Bernardino. \nThe FBI has also described Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik as being \"self-radicalised\" yet inspired by IS.", "date": "18 March 2016", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-35838588", "tags": "inspired faisal university mohammad california says stabbed student group fbi attacker"}
