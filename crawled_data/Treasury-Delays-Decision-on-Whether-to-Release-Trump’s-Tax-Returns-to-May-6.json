{"title": "Treasury Delays Decision on Whether to Release Trump\u2019s Tax Returns to May 6", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin again delayed a decision on whether to turn over President Trump\u2019s tax returns to Congress, telling House lawmakers late Tuesday that the Treasury and Justice Departments needed until May 6 to assess the legality of the \u201cunprecedented\u201d request.\nIn a letter to Representative Richard E. Neal, the Democratic chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Mnuchin said that the Treasury Department \u201ccannot act upon your request unless and until it is determined to be consistent with law.\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said the department expected to make a final decision by May 6 \u201cafter receiving the Justice Department\u2019s legal conclusions.\u201d\nEarlier Tuesday, Hogan Gidley, a White House spokesman, signaled that Mr. Trump was girding for a protracted fight over his tax returns.\n[Update: Steven Mnuchin refuses to release Trump\u2019s tax returns to Congress.]\n\u201cAs I understand it, the president is pretty clear, once he\u2019s out of audit, he\u2019ll think about doing it, but he is not inclined to do so at this time,\u201d Mr. Gidley said on Fox News.\nMr. Trump has used the excuse of an Internal Revenue Service audit since the 2016 presidential campaign as a reason not to release his tax records, though no law prevents a taxpayer from releasing returns while under audit.\nThis month, Mr. Neal formally requested from the Internal Revenue Service six years\u2019 worth of the president\u2019s personal and business tax returns. The Treasury Department, which oversees the I.R.S., missed the first deadline to provide the returns, and Mr. Mnuchin previously told Mr. Neal in a letter that he needed more time to study the lawfulness of the request.\nMr. Mnuchin expressed concern that the request was being made for political purposes and was a violation of taxpayer privacy that could lead to the I.R.S. being weaponized against both parties in the future.\nMr. Mnuchin, in his most recent letter, appeared to be laying the groundwork for the legal rationale to deny the request, listing several \u201clegal concerns\u201d that have prompted the Treasury Department to consult with the Justice Department. Those included \u201cconstitutional limits\u201d on gaining access to private tax returns and the \u201casserted purpose\u201d for seeking the records.\nMr. Mnuchin made the argument that Mr. Neal\u2019s request represented \u201cexposure for the sake of exposure\u201d of Mr. Trump\u2019s tax returns and said it was different than traditional requests for taxpayer information, which tend to be used for statistical purposes to aid legislation. An appendix to the letter listed numerous examples of Mr. Neal and other Democrats calling for Mr. Trump\u2019s tax returns to be made public.\nMr. Neal issued a terse statement on Tuesday but did not indicate his next move, which could include a subpoena or a lawsuit. The matter could ultimately be decided by the Supreme Court.\n\u201cThis afternoon, Secretary Mnuchin notified me that once again, the I.R.S. will miss the deadline,\u201d he said. \u201cI plan to consult with counsel about my next steps.\u201d\nBut other Democratic lawmakers said they were prepared to escalate things quickly.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t get to pick and choose the laws with which they will comply,\u201d said Representative Lloyd Doggett of Texas. \u201cAfter so much of their double talk, prompt action must be taken to secure what they have wrongfully refused.\u201d\nSenator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said that Treasury\u2019s lack of cooperation was an example of the Trump administration\u2019s \u201clawlessness.\u201d\n\u201cSecretary Mnuchin and the White House have blatantly interfered with the I.R.S.\u2019s obligation to provide the president\u2019s tax returns, and action is needed to force this administration to follow the law,\u201d Mr. Wyden said.\nMr. Neal has largely dismissed Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s arguments that the request could violate taxpayer privacy and that it was being done for political purposes, saying that they lacked merit. He gave the Treasury Department until Tuesday to comply and said that failing to do so would be \u201cinterpreted as a denial of my request.\u201d\nIn his letter, Mr. Mnuchin said that the delay was not a failure to comply with the request and that portraying it as such would be \u201ca misinterpretation.\u201d\n\u201cThe committee\u2019s request has not been denied or granted at this time,\u201d he said.\nLast week, in a sign of how much attention Mr. Trump is paying to the proceedings, his personal lawyer urged the Treasury Department not to release the president\u2019s tax returns and accused Democratic lawmakers of having a \u201cradical view of unchecked congressional power.\u201d", "date": "April 23, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/23/us/politics/trump-taxes.html", "tags": "may tax \u201c treasury trump whether returns mnuchin delays decision request release"}
