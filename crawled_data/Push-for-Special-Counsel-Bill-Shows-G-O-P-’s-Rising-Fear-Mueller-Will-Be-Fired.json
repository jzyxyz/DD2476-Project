{"title": "Push for Special Counsel Bill Shows G.O.P.\u2019s Rising Fear Mueller Will Be Fired", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Mitch McConnell\u2019s unilateral declaration this week that he would not allow a vote on legislation to protect the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, provoked outrage from Democrats who said Mr. McConnell was giving President Trump carte blanche to oust the leader of the investigation into Russian election interference and the president\u2019s inner circle.\nIn reality, the bipartisan bill would stand little chance of passage even if Mr. McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and majority leader, relented and allowed it to be debated and approved by the Senate. House Republicans are adamantly opposed. And if the bill somehow cleared Congress, Mr. Trump would have no incentive to sign a measure limiting his power. On top of that, the legislation might not be constitutional.\nBut supporters of the bill are pressing ahead anyway, intensifying a dispute that underscores both rising concern among Republicans that Mr. Trump might fire Mr. Mueller and uncertainty about just how they would react if he did.\nMr. McConnell\u2019s stance has serious consequences. Backers of the legislation believe that a strong Senate show of support for Mr. Mueller and his inquiry would send an unmistakable signal to Mr. Trump that dismissing Mr. Mueller would present serious complications for his presidency.\n\u201cIt would send a message,\u201d said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who recently endorsed the special counsel proposal written by two Republican senators, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and two Democratic senators, Chris Coons of Delaware and Cory Booker of New Jersey.\nRepublicans both inside and outside the government warn that firing Mr. Mueller would be very unwise.\n\u201cYou need to leave him alone, let him do his job and get it over with,\u201d said Saxby Chambliss, a retired senator from Georgia who was the top Republican on the Intelligence Committee and talks frequently with his former colleagues about Mr. Trump and the special counsel. \u201cThe president keeps slamming Mueller, and I think that politically just doesn\u2019t play well, even with folks I know who are part of the president\u2019s base.\u201d\nMr. McConnell\u2019s argument has consistently been that such legislation is not needed because Mr. Trump will not take action against Mr. Mueller. But the president\u2019s increasing anger and frustration about the inquiry has other Republicans joining Democrats in worrying that the counsel might be about to lose his job. Although top Republicans have said there would be significant blowback, it remains unclear what steps would be taken beyond admonishment and hand-wringing.\nOne top Senate Republican acknowledged privately that there may be little else the party would do. Any move toward impeachment seems out of the question in the Republican-controlled Congress. Conservatives in the House are instead demanding an end to the Mueller inquiry.\nWhile the Senate could censure the president, it is doubtful Republicans would take that action before midterm elections in which they will be relying on Trump supporters to help them hold the Senate. It has been done only once before, in the case of Andrew Jackson (coincidentally a Trump favorite), and was later reversed.\nAnother Republican suggested that the Senate could refuse to consider Justice Department nominees unless the president agreed to the naming of a new counsel, a reaction Democrats would consider woefully insufficient. Democrats fear they might not learn the Republican reaction until after the president takes his own action.\n\u201cWhy not head off a constitutional crisis at the pass, rather than waiting until it\u2019s too late?\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said Thursday in calling for approval of the special counsel legislation. \u201cWhy even flirt with the prospect of a president challenging the very nature of our system of government?\u201d\nDemocrats are just as concerned that Mr. Trump and House Republicans are building a separate case for firing Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, who is overseeing the investigation as a result of the decision by Attorney General Jeff Sessions to recuse himself. They fear that a move against Mr. Rosenstein would not grab as much attention as dismissing Mr. Mueller and that Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s successor could then constrain the inquiry.\nPressed again Wednesday evening at a news conference about whether he intended to fire either of them, Mr. Trump repeated his denunciation of the idea of collusion between Russia and his campaign as a hoax and called for the inquiry to be wrapped up. \u201cAs far as the two gentlemen you told me about, they\u2019ve been saying I\u2019m going to get rid of them for the last three months, four months, five months,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re still here.\u201d\nDespite Mr. McConnell\u2019s resistance, Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee, still plans for his panel to take up the special counsel bill next week. It appears to have a strong chance of receiving the committee\u2019s approval.\n\u201cThe views of the majority leader are important to consider, but they do not govern what happens here on the Judiciary Committee,\u201d Mr. Grassley said Thursday.\nMr. McConnell has previously demonstrated that he is willing to bottle up a bill he believes could divide Senate Republicans or prove politically problematic, even if it has bipartisan support from members of the Judiciary Committee. In 2016, he refused to take up a criminal justice overhaul that could have passed the Senate with the backing of Mr. Grassley and many other Republicans, citing objections from a handful of conservatives.\nMr. Tillis and his allies say they still hope to sway Mr. McConnell. \u201cIt\u2019s on us to convince the leader that it\u2019s a worthwhile effort,\u201d Mr. Tillis said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get the votes, and that will come if we get a successful outcome out of Judiciary.\u201d\nThe fight over the measure is taking place as James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, continues a high-profile media tour promoting his tell-all about clashes with Mr. Trump. Ms. Collins and other Republicans say they have found the entire exercise unseemly and damaging to the F.B.I. They contrasted Mr. Comey\u2019s performance with what they say is the professionalism being exhibited by Mr. Mueller, a man well known to many lawmakers from his time at the F.B.I. and Justice Department.\n\u201cJames Comey is no Bob Mueller,\u201d Ms. Collins said.\nNow she and many others are eager to protect Mr. Mueller from suffering Mr. Comey\u2019s fate \u2014 fired by Mr. Trump over the Russia investigation.", "date": "April 19, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/19/us/politics/mueller-special-counsel-legislation-senate.html", "tags": "\u201c mcconnell counsel president would republicans g.o.p. fear shows fired bill rising push special mueller"}
