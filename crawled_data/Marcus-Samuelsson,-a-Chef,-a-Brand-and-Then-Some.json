{"title": "Marcus Samuelsson, a Chef, a Brand and Then Some", "content": "MARCUS SAMUELSSON, dapper in a Ralph Lauren tuxedo and patterned scarf, is working the celebrity-couture crowd at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\nIt is a Monday evening, just around 7, and Mr. Samuelsson \u2014 hotshot chef, food impresario and kinetic force behind Red Rooster Harlem, one of Manhattan\u2019s restaurants of the moment \u2014 is displaying his usual verve.\nOn the red carpet, he snaps a picture of his glamorous wife, the model and philanthropist Maya Haile, with Beyonc\u00e9. In the European sculpture gallery, he is chatting with Kanye West and several of the New York Knicks. At the Temple of Dendur, he is dining with Andr\u00e9 Balazs, the hotel owner, and Chelsea Handler.\nThe next morning at 10, Mr. Samuelsson, in a fresh shirt and tux trousers, is sitting in a sound studio some 60 blocks downtown, painstakingly recording the audio version of his new memoir, \u201cYes, Chef.\u201d Six hours later, in a vintage, red velvet tuxedo jacket, he is overseeing an intimate dinner for 350 at Gotham Hall on behalf of Queen Silvia and Princess Madeleine of Sweden.\nAnd the morning after that, Mr. Samuelsson is back uptown to work the lunch rush at Red Rooster, that culinary mosaic of Southern, Swedish and Ethiopian comforts on Lenox Avenue in Harlem.\nSuch is the wild and frenetic life of the modern celebrity chef, that strange amalgam of food savvy, marketing acumen and business skill all wrapped, in Mr. Samuelsson\u2019s case, into a media-ready package. At 41, he has exploded not only onto New York\u2019s food scene but also onto its cutthroat food business scene.\nYes, there is Red Rooster and five other restaurants. But there is more \u2014 much more. A forthcoming cookware collection for Macy\u2019s. A new line of teas. Deals with American Airlines and MasterCard. Appearances on \u201cTop Chef Masters,\u201d \u201cChopped All-Stars\u201d and \u201cThe Next Iron Chef.\u201d Two Web sites, FoodRepublic.com and marcussamuelsson.com, not to mention four cookbooks and the memoir. His growing, multimillion-dollar enterprise stretches from New York to Chicago to California to Stockholm, and employs more than 700 people.\nIt is a time-tested recipe. Mr. Samuelsson is the figurative heir of Julia Child and Wolfgang Puck, but he is hardly the only one. Mario Batali, Todd English, Tom Colicchio, Alain Ducasse, Bobby Flay, Lidia Bastianich, David Burke \u2014 the list of marquee names in celebrity chefdom is long. Many of these chefs have built sprawling empires of restaurants \u2014 Mr. Batali has 25 \u2014 and have captured the popular imagination with TV shows, iPhone apps and assorted products.\nThe question for Mr. Samuelsson and other rising stars is how far and how fast they can push a personal brand. The more business ventures they start, the less they can personally control the quality. It is a quandary that any successful entrepreneur faces as a business grows.\n\u201cWe constantly have to edit, curate, sift through our brand,\u201d Mr. Samuelsson says. \u201cWhere is the stretch? Where is the perfect fit? Where does it make sense? You have to be a Baryshnikov.\u201d\nIt is a challenge, but the financial rewards can be big. Successful restaurants in major cities can bring in $10 million a year, more for hot spots like Red Rooster. But chefs can easily double their income with endorsements, books, consulting jobs and just about anything emblazoned with their names.\nMr. Puck, who got the initial idea for a line of frozen foods from Johnny Carson, a regular at his Spago restaurant in the 1980s, today oversees a $400 million-a-year company. Some $30 million of that comes from consumer products like soups and sauces. His line of appliances and cookware generates $50 million. \u201cCooking is an evolution,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you don\u2019t change, you fall behind.\u201d\u00a0\nFood snobs bristle, but even the most elite chefs \u2014 ones formally trained in French cuisine, for example, or those with Michelin stars \u2014 often branch out beyond the kitchen. Eric Ripert is the celebrated chef at Le Bernardin, which has been awarded a four-star rating by The New York Times since it opened in 1986. He also has a show on YouTube. Ferran Adri\u00e0, who won three Michelin stars for his avant-garde cuisine at elBulli, on the Costa Brava in Spain, is consulting on food trends with PepsiCo, the maker of soda and Fritos. He helped develop a line of Lays potato chips in flavors like chicken.\nAny chefs worth their toques want to serve great food. But the business reality is that few chefs succeed simply by making the best fois gras terrine or black cod with miso.\n\u201cIf you want to grow, you need to exploit who you are as a chef,\u201d says Susan Ungaro, the president of the James Beard Foundation.\nAT Red Rooster, Mr. Samuelsson never seems to stand still. On a recent evening, he is at the front of the house, reminding a hostess to \u201cactivate,\u201d or engage with customers. Then he is meeting and greeting in the dining room. A group of 20-something women asks to be photographed with him. Then he is back in the kitchen, picking bones from red snapper, telling servers to have dish towels ready and moving a trash can out of the way.\nHis remarkable New York success story, however, started a world away, in Ethiopia. Mr. Samuelsson was born in a village there, and after his mother died during a tuberculosis epidemic, he and his sister were adopted by a white family in Goteborg, Sweden. Eventually, he worked his way up through restaurant kitchens and landed in New York.\nAs the chef of the Scandinavian restaurant Aquavit in Manhattan, he earned a three-star rating from The Times in 1995, at the age of 23. Four years later, the James Beard Foundation crowned him as the industry\u2019s rising star, and in 2003, as the best chef in New York City.\nThen the bottom fell out of the economy in 2008. Merkato 55, a pan-African restaurant he opened in the meatpacking district of Manhattan, never really jelled. \u201cI wanted to do it so bad, but I didn\u2019t do my homework,\u201d he says.\nAquavit was suffering, too, both in New York and at its outpost in Tokyo. Mr. Samuelsson\u2019s relationship with his longtime business partner and mentor, Hakan Swahn, began to fray. For Mr. Samuelsson, it was time to move on.\nBut the breakup was not easy \u2014 or cheap. Mr. Samuelsson had to buy back the rights to use his own name, at least on the Internet. Draining his bank account, he bought back the domain name, marcussamuelsson.com, from Mr. Swahn.\nAfter the breakup, Mr. Samuelsson did a lot of soul-searching during what he calls \u201clong, dark days of summer.\u201d What did he do wrong? Why didn\u2019t it work?\n\u201cIf I used drugs, that would have been the time,\u201d he says. Looking back, he says he has no regrets. \u201cHow you break up, it\u2019s messy and it\u2019s hurtful,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we\u2019re big boys. We move on.\u201d\nFor his part, Mr. Swahn says of Mr. Samuelsson, \u201cAquavit certainly became a more renowned restaurant during his tenure and owes him a huge piece of its success.\u201d\nWithout a restaurant of his own, Mr. Samuelsson focused on building his personal brand. In 2009, he starred in the second season of \u201cTop Chef Masters\u201d \u2014 and won. Shortly after the taping, he cooked President Obama\u2019s first state dinner, in honor of Manmohan Singh, the prime minister of India, creating a menu of roasted potato dumplings with tomato chutney, green curry prawns, smoked collard greens and coconut aged basmati rice. He also scored a six-figure deal with Target in 2010 to design limited-edition dish towels and to appear at the opening of its Harlem store.\nSuch efforts proved crucial as he built his own business, the Marcus Samuelsson Group. The ancillary ventures helped provide cash flow and, more important, kept his own brand in the public eye.\nHe spent two years building a strategy with his co-founder, Andrew Chapman, a New Yorker with Swedish roots. As they envisioned it, the company would take a multipronged approach to food, with a business that included restaurants, media, products and community work. The cornerstone, Red Rooster, opened in December 2010.\nAT Macy\u2019s flagship store in Manhattan, the Marcus Samuelsson show is in full swing. It is early July, and he is doing a cooking demonstration as part of the book tour for his memoir. Wearing a wireless headset, he moves through the kitchen, playing the role of television host as his sous chef cooks a meal for the audience.\n\u201cI knew that guy looked familiar,\u201d says one shopper, who stops to watch the demo. \u201cI saw him on CBS This Morning.\u201d\nYet, for all of this, Mr. Samuelsson still faces the usual challenges of a small-business owner.\nWhen he opened Red Rooster, his team didn\u2019t expect 600 daily covers \u2014 customers, in restaurant-speak \u2014 and had to buy more refrigerated coolers to accommodate the necessary extra food. During a heat wave this summer, two air-conditioners broke down. The restaurant made do for a couple of days, serving free lemonade and iced tea. Before the sister restaurant, Ginny\u2019s Supper Club, opened in the basement of Red Rooster early this year, Mr. Chapman, who is also the chief executive, had to run to the local Kinko\u2019s to copy fliers for the launch party.\nAs it has grown, the Marcus Samuelsson Group has had to become more disciplined.\nMr. Samuelsson and Mr. Chapman have built out their executive staff. They hired Nils Noren, who had worked with Mr. Samuelsson at Aquavit, to help oversee the food-related aspects of the operation. He was a point person for a six-figure multiyear consulting deal with Restaurant Associates to develop a menu for corporate cafeterias, including those at Goldman Sachs, Cond\u00e9 Nast and Morgan Stanley. Christina Wang, a trained baker and former consultant at Booz & Company, brings her business acumen, with contracts, negotiations and the occasional Excel spreadsheet. They have also bolstered their stable of lawyers and accountants to add expertise in sponsorship deals, editorial content and other areas where the company is expanding.\nThe team now has weekly meetings, in part to make sure that members can keep tabs on Mr. Samuelsson and all of his ideas. He can find inspiration everywhere. On a recent trek to Roberta\u2019s, an upscale pizza place in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn, he saw a child selling lemonade and iced tea on the street corner, and decided he needed a similar stand at Red Rooster. He polled his Twitter followers to decide between vintage or modern dishes at the restaurant. (Vintage won.)\nMr. Samuelsson is trying to balance the culinary and the commercial. After investing $3 million in Red Rooster, he and his business partner are plowing the profits back into the business. They used some of the money to finance Ginny\u2019s.\nHe is also looking at new projects, albeit selectively and with a less-is-more strategy. This fall, he is opening a casual restaurant in Alice Tully Hall with Restaurant Associates, called American Table Cafe and Bar by Marcus Samuelsson. The idea is to marry the cultural hub that is Lincoln Center with the broader urban area, and infuse it with a sense of fun.\nBut he remains obsessed with details. For American Table, he helped choose the seat cushions and refine the logo. He rejected one style of the Macy\u2019s cookware, reasoning it was too heavy for someone like his grandmother.\nMR. SAMUELSSON says he wants to bring a sense of \u201cdemocracy\u201d to dining and to ensure high-quality food in multiple price categories. That is one reason he initially opted to develop a line of food for American Airlines \u2014 not for first-class passengers, but for those stuck in coach. He also plans to open the Nook at Red Rooster, a walk-up window where passers-by can buy coffee, pastries or hot dogs with shrimp salad for a few dollars.\nHe often seeks interaction with the broader community, whether at his restaurants, through the Internet, or on his daily subway ride. In Harlem, he has held free cooking classes for children and has helped expand the farmer\u2019s market in the area. More than 70 percent of Red Rooster employees are local residents, many of whom had little experience with fine dining. The restaurant hired additional managers to get the employees up to speed.\n\u201cWhen you look at strategy, it\u2019s not set up to be a pure moneymaking machine,\u201d says Derek Evans, the media adviser for the Marcus Samuelsson Group. \u201cIt\u2019s a passion machine.\u201d", "date": "AUG. 4, 2012AUG. 4, 2012AUG. 4, 2012", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/05/business/marcus-samuelsson-both-a-chef-and-a-brand.html", "tags": "food samuelsson \u201c red chef brand marcus restaurant rooster new \u2014"}
