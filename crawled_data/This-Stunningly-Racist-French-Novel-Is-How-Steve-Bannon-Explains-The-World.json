{"title": "This Stunningly Racist French Novel Is How Steve Bannon Explains The World", "content": "Stephen Bannon, President Donald Trump\u2019s chief strategist and the driving force behind the administration\u2019s controversial ban on travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries, has a favorite metaphor he uses to describe the largest refugee crisis in human history. \n\u201cIt\u2019s been almost a Camp of the Saints-type invasion into Central and then Western and Northern Europe,\u201d he said in October 2015.\n\u201cThe whole thing in Europe is all about immigration,\u201d he said in January 2016. \u201cIt\u2019s a global issue today \u2014 this kind of global Camp of the Saints.\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s not a migration,\u201d he said later that January. \u201cIt\u2019s really an invasion. I call it the Camp of the Saints.\u201d \n\u201cWhen we first started talking about this a year ago,\u201d he said in April 2016, \u201cwe called it the Camp of the Saints. ... I mean, this is Camp of the Saints, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nBannon has agitated for a host of anti-immigrant measures. In his previous role as executive chairman of the right-wing news site Breitbart \u2014 which he called a \u201cplatform for the alt-right,\u201d the online movement of white nationalists \u2014 he made anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim news a focus. \nBut the top Trump aide\u2019s repeated references to The Camp of the Saints, an obscure 1973 novel by French author Jean Raspail, reveal even more about how he understands the world. The book is a cult favorite on the far right, yet it\u2019s never found a wider audience. There\u2019s a good reason for that: It\u2019s breathtakingly racist.\n\u201c[This book is] racist in the literal sense of the term. It uses race as the main characterization of characters,\u201d said C\u00e9cile Alduy, professor of French at Stanford University and an expert on the contemporary French far right. \u201cIt describes the takeover of Europe by waves of immigrants that wash ashore like the plague.\u201d\nThe book, she said, \u201creframes everything as the fight to death between races.\u201d\nUpon the novel\u2019s release in the United States in 1975, the influential book review magazine Kirkus Reviews pulled no punches: \u201cThe publishers are presenting The Camp of the Saints as a major event, and it probably is, in much the same sense that Mein Kampf was a major event.\u201d\nLinda Chavez, a Republican commentator who has worked for GOP presidents from Ronald Reagan to George W. Bush but opposed Trump\u2019s election, also reviewed the book back then. Forty years later, she hasn\u2019t forgotten it.\n\u201cIt is really shockingly racist,\u201d Chavez told The Huffington Post, \u201cand to have the counselor to the president see this as one of his touchstones, I think, says volumes about his attitude.\u201d\nThe plot of The Camp of the Saints follows a poor Indian demagogue, named \u201cthe turd-eater\u201d because he literally eats shit, and the deformed, apparently psychic child who sits on his shoulders. Together, they lead an \u201carmada\u201d of 800,000 impoverished Indians sailing to France. Dithering European politicians, bureaucrats and religious leaders, including a liberal pope from Latin America, debate whether to let the ships land and accept the Indians or to do the right thing \u2014 in the book\u2019s vision \u2014 by recognizing the threat the migrants pose and killing them all. \nThe non-white people of Earth, meanwhile, wait silently for the Indians to reach shore. The landing will be the signal for them to rise up everywhere and overthrow white Western society. \nThe French government eventually gives the order to repel the armada by force, but by then the military has lost the will to fight. Troops battle among themselves as the Indians stream on shore, trampling to death the left-wing radicals who came to welcome them. Poor black and brown people literally overrun Western civilization. Chinese people pour into Russia; the queen of England is forced to marry her son to a Pakistani woman; the mayor of New York must house an African-American family at Gracie Mansion. Raspail\u2019s rogue heroes, the defenders of white Christian supremacy, attempt to defend their civilization with guns blazing but are killed in the process.\nCalgues, the obvious Raspail stand-in, is one of those taking up arms against the migrants and their culturally \u201ccuckolded\u201d white supporters. Just before killing a radical hippie, Calgues compares his own actions to past heroic, sometimes mythical defenses of European Christendom. He harkens back to famous battles that fit the clash-of-civilizations narrative \u2014 the defense of Rhodes against the Ottoman Empire, the fall of Constantinople to the same \u2014 and glorifies colonial wars of conquest and the formation of the Ku Klux Klan.\nOnly white Europeans like Calgues are portrayed as truly human in The Camp of the Saints. The Indian armada brings \u201cthousands of wretched creatures\u201d whose very bodies arouse disgust: \u201cScraggy branches, brown and black \u2026 All bare, those fleshless Gandhi-arms.\u201d Poor brown children are spoiled fruit \u201cstarting to rot, all wormy inside, or turned so you can\u2019t see the mold.\u201d \nThe ship\u2019s inhabitants are also sexual deviants who turn the voyage into a grotesque orgy. \u201cEverywhere, rivers of sperm,\u201d Raspail writes. \u201cStreaming over bodies, oozing between breasts, and buttocks, and thighs, and lips, and fingers.\u201d \nThe white Christian world is on the brink of destruction, the novel suggests, because these black and brown people are more fertile and more numerous, while the West has lost that necessary belief in its own cultural and racial superiority. As he talks to the hippie he will soon kill, Calgues explains how the youth went so wrong: \u201cThat scorn of a people for other races, the knowledge that one\u2019s own is best, the triumphant joy at feeling oneself to be part of humanity\u2019s finest \u2014 none of that had ever filled these youngsters\u2019 addled brains.\u201d\nThe Camp of the Saints \u2014 which draws its title from Revelation 20:9 \u2014 is nothing less than a call to arms for the white Christian West, to revive the spirit of the Crusades and steel itself for bloody conflict against the poor black and brown world without and the traitors within. The novel\u2019s last line links past humiliations tightly to its own grim parable about modern migration. \u201cThe Fall of Constantinople,\u201d Raspail\u2019s unnamed narrator says, \u201cis a personal misfortune that happened to all of us only last week.\u201d\nRaspail wrote The Camp of the Saints in 1972 and 1973, after a stay at his aunt\u2019s house near Cannes on the southern coast of France. Looking out across the Mediterranean, he had an epiphany: \u201cAnd what if they came?\u201d he thought to himself. \u201cThis \u2018they\u2019 was not clearly defined at first,\u201d he told the conservative publication Le Point in 2015. \u201cThen I imagined that the Third World would rush into this blessed country that is France.\u201d\nRaspail\u2019s novel has been published in the U.S. several times, each time with the backing of the anti-immigration movement. \nThe U.S. publishing house Scribner was the first to translate the book into English in 1975, but it failed to reach a wide audience amid withering reviews by critics. A rare favorable take appeared in National Review. \u201cRaspail brings his reader to the surprising conclusion that killing a million or so starving refugees from India would be a supreme act of individual sanity and cultural health,\u201d then-Dartmouth professor Jeffrey Hart wrote in 1975. \u201cRaspail is to genocide what [D.H. Lawrence] was to sex.\u201d Hart added that \u201ca great fuss\u201d was being made over \u201cRaspail\u2019s supposed racism,\u201d but that the \u201cliberal rote anathema on \u2018racism\u2019 is in effect a poisonous assault upon Western self-preference.\u201d\nThe book received a second life in 1983 when Cordelia Scaife May, heiress to the Mellon fortune and sister to right-wing benefactor Richard Mellon Scaife, funded its republication and distribution. This time it gained a cult following among immigration opponents.\nMay\u2019s money has also been instrumental in funding the efforts of John Tanton, the godfather of the anti-immigration movement in the U.S. Tanton, who began as an environmentalist and population control proponent, founded a host of groups focused on restricting immigration, including the Federation of American Immigration Reform, the Center for Immigration Studies, NumbersUSA and U.S. English. May\u2019s fortune has fueled these groups with tens of millions of dollars in contributions over the years.\nLinda Chavez was recruited in 1987 to head U.S. English, which advocates for English to be designated the country\u2019s official language. But then a series of disturbing stories painted Tanton\u2019s motives in a racial light. Among other issues, Chavez said she learned that his funding came from the pro-eugenics Pioneer Fund and from May, who Chavez knew had helped publish The Camp of the Saints. Chavez recalled seeing Tanton\u2019s staffers carrying the book around their offices. She quit the group.\nTanton, who insists his opposition to immigration is not connected to race at all, told The Washington Post in 2006 that his mind \u201cbecame focused\u201d on the issue after reading The Camp of the Saints. In 1995, his small publishing house, Social Contract Press, brought the book back into print for a third time in the U.S., again with funding from May.\u00a0Historians Paul Kennedy and Matt Connelly tied the book to then-current concerns about global demographic trends in a cover story for The Atlantic.\n\u201cOver the years the American public has absorbed a great number of books, articles, poems and films which exalt the immigrant experience,\u201d Tanton wrote in 1994. \u201cIt is easy for the feelings evoked by Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty to obscure the fact that we are currently receiving too many immigrants (and receiving them too fast) for the health of our environment and of our common culture. Raspail evokes different feelings and that may help to pave the way for policy changes.\u201d\nIn 2001, the book was republished one more time, again by Tanton, and again gained a cult following among opponents of immigration like the border-patrolling Minutemen and eventually the online \u201calt-right.\u201d\nBannon\u2019s alt-right-loving Breitbart has run multiple articles over the past three years referencing the novel. When Pope Francis told a joint session of Congress that the U.S. should open its arms to refugees in September 2015, Breitbart\u2019s Julia Hahn, now an aide to Bannon in the White House, compared his admonition to Raspail\u2019s liberal Latin American pontiff. And the novel\u2019s thesis that migration is invasion in disguise is often reflected in Bannon\u2019s public comments.\nThe refugee crisis \u201cdidn\u2019t just happen by happenstance,\u201d Bannon said in an April 2016 radio interview with Sebastian Gorka, who now works for the National Security Council. \u201cThese are not war refugees. It\u2019s something much more insidious going on.\u201d\nBannon has also echoed the novel\u2019s theory that secular liberals who favor immigration and diversity weaken the West.\n\u201cDo you believe the elites in this country have the backbone, have the belief in the underlying principles of the Judeo-Christian West to actually win this war?\u201d he asked Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), now the attorney general, in June 2016. \n\u201cI\u2019m worried about that. \u2026 They\u2019re eroding, regularly it seems to me, classical American values that are so critical to our success,\u201d Sessions replied.\nLike Raspail, Bannon has reveled in the past victories of Christendom over Islamic forces.\n\u201cIf you look back at the long history of the Judeo-Christian West struggle against Islam, I believe that our forefathers kept their stance, and I think they did the right thing,\u201d he said in a 2014 speech broadcast to a conference at the Vatican. \u201cI think they kept it out of the world, whether it was at Vienna [the Battle of Vienna in 1683], or Tours [the Battle of Tours in 732], or other places. \u2026 They were able to stave this off, and they were able to defeat it, and they were able to bequeath to us a church and a civilization that really is the flower of mankind.\u201d\nNow Bannon sits at the right hand of the U.S. president, working to beat back what Bannon calls \u201cthis Muslim invasion.\u201d And Trump is all in on the project. During the campaign, he called for a ban on all Muslims entering the country. His Jan. 28 executive order, since blocked in the courts, turned this campaign idea into executive policy.\nTrump has continued to defend the executive order as a life-or-death national security issue. \u201cWe cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America,\u201d he said in his first speech to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday.\nFive days earlier, Trump had called his immigration enforcement efforts a \u201cmilitary operation.\u201d\nAlthough Department of Homeland Security officials walked back that statement, the president\u2019s conflation of immigration with warfare did not go unnoticed.\n\u201cThey see this as a war,\u201d Chavez said.\nChavez, who supports some of Trump\u2019s economic policy proposals, called the direction the White House is taking on immigration and race \u201cextremely dangerous.\u201d She said Trump\u2019s immigration moves are \u201ca kind of purging of America of anything but our Northern European roots.\u201d Bannon, she added, \u201cwants to make America white again.\u201d", "date": "\n03/04/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/steve-bannon-camp-of-the-saints-immigration_n_58b75206e4b0284854b3dc03", "tags": "raspail bannon steve novel world immigration book explains camp stunningly \u201d racist saints \u2014 french"}
