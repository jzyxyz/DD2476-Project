The encounter is perhaps the friendliest meeting of strangers in the woods we\u2019ve seen so far in Westeros, where such occasions can get a bit murder-y. Even when Arya admits the true purpose of her travels \u2015 to kill Queen Cersei (Lena Headey) \u2015 the Lannister group assumes she\u2019s just joshin\u2019\u00a0around.\nSheeran\u2019s lyrics actually come straight from George R.R. Martin\u2019s \u201cSong of Ice and Fire\u201d book series, where they\u2019re sung to Tyrion about his lover Shae:\n(\u201cIt\u2019s a new one,\u201d Sheeran says of the song.)\nIt\u2019s easy to see, though, how the lyrics could reference a certain other Lannister with a literal gold hand \u2015 Jaime (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau), whose relationship with sister Cersei could also be described as \u201chis secret treasure.\u201d\nIn any case, the scene was a treat for Williams, a big fan of Sheeran, whose small part in the new season was announced earlier this year. But the young actress\u2019 enthusiasm for the \u201cShape of You\u201d singer\u2019s musical stylings couldn\u2019t stop fans from mercilessly picking apart the scene on Twitter.\nAlthough a few were pleasantly surprised ...\nMany hardened \u201cThrones\u201d fans began calling for violence.\nSome criticized the move for taking viewers out of the story with the sudden appearance of a familiar real-life pop star.\nWhile others joined in for a bit of sarcastic fun.\nAt least Maisie looked happy about the whole thing!\nSheeran\u2019s appearance on \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d follows cameos by several other musicians, including Coldplay\u2019s Will Champion and Of Monsters and Men.\n\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d airs Sundays at 9 p.m. ET on HBO.", "date": "\n07/17/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ed-sheeran-game-of-thrones_n_596cb6a4e4b0d6341fea5f7c", "tags": "showed fire game men sheeran season \u201d \u2015 ed lannister called arya fans blood thrones"}
