{"title": "'Game Of Thrones' Season 8 Release Date Might Be Later Than We Thought- Exclusive", "content": "EARLIER: Winter is coming ... possibly with a little bit of a delay.\nEarlier this year, rumor had it that \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d Season 8 would begin airing sometime in April 2019. The gossip started with a quote Maisie Williams allegedly gave Metro in the U.K., which she later denied. Still,\u00a0fans hopped on the date and rally around it to this day.\nAnd, hey, a release earlier in the year makes sense. HBO\u2019s president of programming, Casey Bloys, said the show would be premiering in the first half of 2019. And in order to qualify for the Emmy Awards in \u201919, a series must air between June 1, 2018, and May 31, 2019. So if HBO wanted the final season of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d to be considered in the next Emmys, it would have to air before the end of May.\nAlas, I\u2019m here to tell you, our April watch may have ended.\nIn an interview with HuffPost, \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d visual effects supervisor Joe Bauer discussed the show\u2019s Emmy hopes (it\u2019s nominated for 22 awards at the 2018 ceremony) as well as its future eligibility. \u201cIn two years we\u2019ll be eligible for the Season 8 work,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich we\u2019re just beginning now.\u201d\nThat\u2019s right. He said the show will be eligible for the 2020 Emmys, not the 2019 Emmys, meaning it would be airing the bulk of its expected six episodes after the 2019 deadline: May 31.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be toiling away on Season 8 until May of 2019, so it\u2019s eight or nine months away,\u201d he added. \u201cBut the prequel is starting to shoot in February, at least the pilot. So we\u2019ll still have quite a lot to do on Season 8 when they\u2019re beginning.\u201d\nBauer said he\u2019s blocked off his schedule until next May for \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d effects work. \u201cSo much of it comes down to timing and all that stuff. The situation changes every week. I know I\u2019m not doing anything else but \u2018Thrones\u2019 until May of next year.\u201d\nThe Emmys do make some exceptions. While May 31 is always the cut-off date, \u201changing episodes\u201d that air after that time can be considered for the previous cycle\u2019s Emmys.\u00a0\n\u201cIf an ongoing series has enough episodes (six or more) in the current eligibility year to qualify as a series, but has one or more episodes, including the season/series finale, airing after May 31, those \u2018hanging episodes\u2019 that are part of the season\u2019s contiguous rollout on the same distribution platform will join the six or more eligible episodes of the series,\u00a0as long as the hanging episodes air prior to the first-round voting deadline,\u201d a representative of the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences told HuffPost.\nFor the 2018 Emmys, the voting deadline was June 25, so shows like \u201cWestworld,\u201d which aired its finale on June 24, will still qualify in their entirety.\nWith the prospect that \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d Season 8 won\u2019t be eligible for the Emmys until two years from now, it\u2019s safe to assume that the majority of its episodes won\u2019t air before May 31. Since Bauer said his effects team is going to be working into May, it seems late May is the earliest Season 8 could premiere.\nBut we\u2019d guess a release date of at least June or maybe July is more feasible. After all, Season 7 premiered in July 2017.\nAs long as HBO doesn\u2019t make us watch a block of ice melt again for the release date (like they did for Season 7), we\u2019re cool with that. That nightmare would\u2019ve scared even the White Walkers.\nNow that we\u2019re done talking about when the series might end, let\u2019s talk about how\u00a0it could end.\n\u201cI thought it was really brave,\u201d Bauer said of the ending of the series. \u201cI thought it\u2019d be interesting to see. It\u2019s very true to what \u2018Thrones\u2019 is, and knowing how it ends, I don\u2019t actually see how it could end any other way.\n\u201cI think the whole series has aimed toward this. I obviously can\u2019t say what it is. I think there will be divisions because people have grown to identify and like and hate various characters, so everybody has their version of how they want it to end based on those things, but looking at it objectively, I think the way it ends is the way it must end, so I\u2019m just going to leave it at that.\u201d\nWhenever it finally airs, it sounds as if it will be worth the wait. Just, again, please no block of ice. Winter wouldn\u2019t even be that cruel.", "date": "\n08/25/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/game-of-thrones-season-8-release-date-later_n_5b7b3bbde4b018b93e96beca", "tags": "thought- may later end thrones might season series \u201d emmys episodes date exclusive release"}
