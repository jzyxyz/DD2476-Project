{"title": "As Google Rep Condemns Online Hate, YouTube Live Stream Fills With Vile Comments", "content": "A Google representative said Tuesday that hate \u201chas no place on YouTube,\u201d a platform the company runs, during a congressional hearing on the rise of hate crimes and white nationalism just after YouTube users spent more than an hour leaving vile messages on an official video feed of the event.\u00a0\nAlexandria Walden, a public policy counsel at Google focused on free expression and human rights, was among the witnesses called before the House Judiciary Committee. Shortly before she began speaking, the comments section of the committee\u2019s official video stream of the hearing was shut off, having been filled with anti-Semitic, Islamophobic, racist and otherwise hateful notions.\u00a0\n\u201cWe are deeply troubled by the increase of hate and extremism in the world,\u201d Walden said. \u201cWe take these issues seriously and want to be part of the solution.\u201d\u00a0\nAfter describing the difficulty in identifying hate speech due to its reliance on context and noting how \u201cborderline\u201d hateful content can be pushed to the sidelines of the platform, Walden stated:\u00a0\u201cHate speech and violent speech have no place on YouTube.\u201d\nWhat was happening on the live stream told a different story, however.\u00a0Commenters were able to leave messages containing slurs for Jewish people and Muslims while others typed \u201c14,\u201d which refers to a white nationalist slogan, and \u201c88,\u201d which signals \u201cHeil Hitler\u201d in white nationalist circles.\u00a0\nCommittee chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) pointed out that the comments had been turned off during the hearing and read a short selection of them. Rep. Louis Gohmert (R-Texas) cut in to ask whether the comments were somehow a \u201choax.\u201d\nIn November, the FBI reported that hate crimes had risen across the U.S. for the third consecutive year.\nThe committee\u2019s hearing comes just weeks after a horrific mass shooting at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, left 50 worshippers dead.\nMany have suggested the massacre to be a tragic consequence of the spread of white nationalism around the world, aided by social media. The Christchurch shooter wrote a lengthy manifesto suggesting he had been motivated by white nationalist ideals\u00a0and live-streamed 17 minutes of the shooting to Facebook through a body camera.\u00a0\nYouTube and Facebook were slammed for allowing the shooter\u2019s gruesome video to proliferate across their platforms. Both companies were forced to play a game of whack-a-mole against users who uploaded copies of it en masse, raising questions about the tech giants\u2019 ability to monitor and suppress hateful content.\nFacebook Public Policy Director Neil Potts said at the hearing that white nationalist and hateful content was not permitted on the site \u201cunder any circumstances.\u201d The social media giant just this week said it would ban white nationalist content.", "date": "\n04/09/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/google-rep-condemns-hate-as-youtube-live-stream-fills-with-vile-comments_n_5ca90437e4b0dca033024e81", "tags": "hearing hate youtube live hateful committee nationalist \u201d white rep online comments stream content condemns google vile fills"}
