{"title": "Set to Lift Interest Rate, Fed Embraces Investors\u2019 Optimism", "content": "The Federal Reserve is poised to raise its benchmark interest rate in mid-March, significantly sooner than investors had expected, as it moves to keep pace with a wave of economic optimism that started with the election of President Trump.\nIn an unusually clear statement about a pending decision, the Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, said on Friday in Chicago that the central bank was likely to act at its next policy-making meeting \u2014 barring any unpleasant economic surprises.\nMs. Yellen added that the Fed still expected to raise rates twice more later in the year, which she said would bring the benchmark rate close to a level that the Fed regards as neutral, with low rates no longer providing an inducement for borrowing and risk-taking. That outlook signals that an end is finally in sight for the Fed\u2019s economic stimulus campaign, devised during the depths of the financial crisis more than eight years ago.\nStanley Fischer, the Fed\u2019s vice chairman, delivered the same message at the same time at a conference in New York. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of substantial change in a relatively short time,\u201d Mr. Fischer said of the postelection shift in economic conditions. \u201cThere is almost no economic indicator that has come in badly in the last three months.\u201d\nAsked whether Fed officials were delivering a coordinated message, Mr. Fischer responded wryly, \u201cIf there has been a conscious effort, I\u2019m about to join it.\u201d\nThe impending rate increase could heighten tensions with the White House, which wants to stimulate growth by cutting taxes, reducing regulation and increasing defense and infrastructure spending. Fed officials have concluded the economy is already growing at something close to the maximum sustainable pace, meaning faster growth should be offset by faster rate increases.\nFinancial markets, however, are taking the prospect of higher rates in stride. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, which is up more than 11 percent since Election Day, ended trading on Friday mostly flat.\nThe prospective Fed move has modest short-term implications for consumers. Interest rates on car loans and some kinds of credit card debt will tick upward, but remain at low levels by historical standards. Rates on 30-year mortgages are up by about half a percentage point over the past year.\nThe broader consequences depend on the Fed\u2019s ability to raise interest rates without slowing economic growth. The Fed\u2019s goal is to return rates to a level that neither encourages nor impedes economic activity. Over the past century, however, most of the central bank\u2019s attempts to strike that balance have ended in economic recessions.\nThe American economy is in the midst of one of the longest expansions in the nation\u2019s history, but it is also one of the weakest. The economy expanded by 1.6 percent in 2016, compared with 2.6 percent in 2015, according to the government\u2019s most recent estimate.\nFed officials have concluded, however, that monetary policy cannot deliver faster growth. The Fed\u2019s job is to minimize unemployment and moderate inflation. The unemployment rate, at 4.8 percent in January, is in a range Fed officials regard as healthy, and prices rose 1.9 percent in the 12 months ending in January, the closest the Fed has come since 2012 to hitting its target of 2 percent annual inflation.\nIn December, the Fed raised its benchmark rate for just the second time since the financial crisis, to a range of 0.5 percent to 0.75 percent, and predicted three increases in 2017.\nAt the beginning of the week, however, Wall Street analysts and investors did not expect the Fed to raise rates again any earlier than June. The Fed issued a measured statement after its policy meeting in early February, and the meeting minutes, published three weeks later, conveyed little sense of urgency.\nNow, after a week of discussions, analysts regard a March increase as highly likely.\nMichael Feroli, the chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, described the shift in Fed language as \u201cremarkably swift and decisive.\u201d Investors put the chances at almost 80 percent in trading on Friday, according to an analysis of asset prices by CME Group.\nSome Fed officials appear particularly focused on the rise of the stock market. William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, who described markets as \u201cvery buoyant\u201d on Tuesday, has said in the past that if markets did not respond to rate increases, the Fed might need to act more forcefully to tighten financial conditions.\nIt is also getting harder to dismiss the market\u2019s reaction to Mr. Trump\u2019s victory as a bout of temporary euphoria. Mr. Fischer noted on Friday that the stock market boom was creating wealth that people would begin to spend.\nMs. Yellen pointed to an improvement in the global context. \u201cThe prospects for further moderate economic growth look encouraging, particularly as risks emanating from abroad appear to have receded somewhat,\u201d she said.\nThe shift in the Fed\u2019s language over the last week also may reflect a recognition that market expectations were not keeping pace with the Fed\u2019s evolving view of the economy. Ms. Yellen, in a February appearance before Congress, hinted that the Fed might be providing a little too much stimulus, describing the Fed\u2019s policy as \u201caccommodative.\u201d But at the start of this week, investors still put a low probability on a March increase.\nMarkets are wary of the Fed\u2019s flirtations with interest rate increases, as the central bank in recent years has often found reasons for last-minute postponements.\nThis time, the Fed chose to overwhelm any lingering doubts.\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Dudley told CNBC that the case for a rate increase \u201chas become a lot more compelling.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, Lael Brainard, a Fed governor who has been one of the most consistent supporters of raising interest rates slowly, suggested that she too was ready to act.\n\u201cWe are closing in on full employment, inflation is moving gradually toward our target, foreign growth is on more solid footing, and risks to the outlook are as close to balanced as they have been in some time,\u201d Ms. Brainard said at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School of Government. \u201cAssuming continued progress, it will likely be appropriate soon to remove additional accommodation, continuing on a gradual path.\u201d\nFed officials often bury their latest views on monetary policy at the end of their speeches. Ms. Brainard\u2019s remarks came at the beginning, so that no one missed the point.\nOn Thursday, another Fed governor, Jerome H. Powell, issued a similarly blunt notice of intent in an interview with CNBC. \u201cI think the case for a rate increase for March has come together, and I think it\u2019s on the table for discussion,\u201d he said.\nThen came Friday, the last day on which Fed rules allowed officials to comment on monetary policy before the March meeting, and Ms. Yellen delivered the last word.\n\u201cAt our meeting later this month,\u201d she said, \u201cthe committee will evaluate whether employment and inflation are continuing to evolve in line with our expectations, in which case a further adjustment of the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate.\u201d\nThe committee is scheduled to meet in Washington on March 14 and 15.", "date": "March 3, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/business/economy/federal-reserve-interest-rates.html", "tags": "set fed percent officials rates investors \u201d ms. embraces economic interest rate lift optimism"}
