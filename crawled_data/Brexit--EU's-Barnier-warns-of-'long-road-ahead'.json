{"title": "Brexit: EU's Barnier warns of 'long road ahead'", "content": "The EU says much work still needs to be done on Brexit, despite agreeing a draft withdrawal document with the UK.\n\"We still have a long road ahead of us on both sides,\" chief negotiator Michel Barnier said.\nThe EU has set out a series of meetings leading to one on 25 November where it plans to approve the Brexit agreement.\nUK Prime Minister Theresa May has won the backing of her cabinet but faces a tough task getting the agreement approved by Parliament.\nA sign of that came on Thursday morning when Mr Barnier's UK counterpart, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, resigned saying he could not \"in good conscience\" support the agreement. He was one of four ministers to quit.\nMrs May later defended the deal in the House of Commons, telling MPs it delivered on the Brexit referendum and provided for an orderly withdrawal.\nMr Barnier was speaking on Thursday morning alongside EU Council head Donald Tusk as the chief negotiator formally handed over the 585-page draft withdrawal agreement.\nMr Barnier said the agreement was fair and balanced, took into account the UK's needs and laid the ground for an \"ambitious new partnership\".\nMr Tusk praised Mr Barnier's work and said the agreement had \"secured the interests of the 27 member states and EU as a whole\".\nHe laid out the timetable for the days ahead.\nMr Tusk said: \"Since the very beginning, we have had no doubt that Brexit is a lose-lose situation, and that our negotiations are only about damage control.\"\nAddressing the UK, he added: \"As much as I am sad to see you leave, I will do everything to make this farewell the least painful possible, for you and for us.\"\nMr Barnier later took the document to the European Parliament. Its president, Antonio Tajani, said MEPs would vote on the deal in early 2019.\nIf the agreement is approved by both sides, a 21-month transition period will kick in, during which a trade deal and the thorny issue of how to ensure there is no physical border between Northern Ireland - part of the UK - and the Republic of Ireland will need to be worked out.\nA smooth border-free exchange underpins the peace deal that ended the Northern Ireland conflict.\nThe draft withdrawal agreement covers so-called \"divorce\" issues as the UK prepares to leave the EU. It includes a \"financial settlement\" from the UK, thought to be about \u00a339bn (\u20ac45bn; $50bn).\nSpeaking at a press briefing in Brussels on Wednesday, Mr Barnier addressed one of the major concerns of the divorce, the Irish \"hard border\" issue.\nHe said that to avoid the need for physical checks on goods or infrastructure at the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, the EU would work with the UK to agree a trade deal. However if talks fail, the so-called \"backstop\" measure would be used.\nBoth sides have resolved to ensure the backstop is not necessary by coming up with alternative arrangements.\n\"If we are not ready by 2020, we can extend the provision so we have more time, and if we are still not there with the future agreement after this, the backstop agreement would kick in,\" he said. \n\"There will be a UK-wide single customs territory which Northern Ireland will remain in, and Northern Ireland will remain aligned to the rules of a single market essential for avoiding a border including on agriculture policy.\"\nThe draft withdrawal agreement states that the transition period may be extended by mutual consent.\nMr Barnier said that any extension would by a one-off, \"by a limited period and by joint agreement\".\nDuring the transition, the UK will be out of the EU. It will have no voting rights but will continue to abide by the majority of its rules.\nThere are also special protocols in place for Gibraltar and Cyprus to enable people there \"to continue to live as they do today\", Mr Barnier added.\nSpain has longstanding claims to the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar and the deal sets out bilateral co-operation on customs, policing, trade, taxation and citizens' rights.\nThe UK has sovereign military bases in Cyprus. EU law will continue to apply at the bases, with the deal securing the rights of the 11,000 Cypriot civilians working there.\nAnalysis by BBC Europe editor, Katya Adler\nThe EU knows there is a very real possibility the Brexit deal could be voted down by the UK Parliament in a few weeks' time.\nI put the question to Michel Barnier on Wednesday night at his press conference - but, skilled politician that he is, he refused to engage.\nBrussels is very keen indeed not to give the impression that the EU might change or come up with a \"better\" Brexit deal text if this one ends up being rejected in the House of Commons.\nMr Barnier quoted Theresa May as saying that this is a deal in the UK's interest.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel on Thursday welcomed the draft agreement, saying: \"I am very happy that, after lengthy and not always easy negotiations, a proposal could be reached.\"\nThe European Parliament's Brexit chief Guy Verhofstadt said the deal had been hammered out after two years of \"intense negotiations\" and he hoped UK MPs would accept that \"there is not a lot of room [for] manoeuvre to say, 'OK, let's start again'\".\nFrench Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said the deal was \"good news for the French economy\" but also issued caution, saying the UK must be made to respect all EU rules.\nFinland's Prime Minister Juha Sipila tweeted to say that while Wednesday's developments were important, \"decisions on both sides are still needed for a final agreement\".\nAustrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said he was \"very pleased\", adding: \"The result is a good one.\"", "date": "15 November 2018", "href": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-46216415", "tags": "brexit barnier agreement warns uk eu mr road ahead ireland deal"}
