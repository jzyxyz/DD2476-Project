{"title": "San Francisco Bans Use Of Facial Recognition Technology By Law Enforcement", "content": "San Francisco has banned the use of facial recognition technology by city agencies, including law enforcement \u2015 becoming the first major U.S. city to do so. \nThe San Francisco Board of Supervisors voted to pass an ordinance on Tuesday that would ban any city department from using facial recognition technology or any information obtained from it. \nPassed with an 8-1 vote, the ordinance will also require city departments to get approval from the Board of Supervisors before purchasing other surveillance technology \u2015 including license plate readers, body cameras and biometrics technology, among other items.\n\u201cThe propensity for facial recognition technology to endanger civil rights and civil liberties substantially outweighs its purported benefits,\u201d the San Francisco ordinance reads. \u201cAnd the technology will exacerbate racial injustice and threaten our ability to live free of continuous government monitoring.\u201d \u00a0\nFacial recognition technology has drawn scrutiny for its flaws, notably for frequently improperly identifying darker-skinned people. \nIn one high-profile example last year, Amazon\u2019s facial recognition tool incorrectly matched the faces of 28 lawmakers with people in mug shots and disproportionately misidentified people of color in a test by the ACLU. \n\u201cWe know face surveillance technology is less accurate for people of color, and a misidentification could subject people to racially biased police violence,\u201d ACLU of Northern California attorney Matt Cagle told HuffPost last week.\nNearby Oakland is expected to vote on a similar rule later this month.", "date": "\n05/14/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/san-francisco-ban-facial-recognition-technology_n_5cdb45cfe4b0c39d2a12f725", "tags": "francisco facial city ordinance recognition san \u201d law bans use technology enforcement"}
