{"title": "Balakot: Indian air strikes target militants in Pakistan", "content": "India says it launched air strikes against militants in Pakistani territory, in a major escalation of tensions between the two countries.\nThe government said strikes targeted a training camp of the Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) group in Balakot. \nPakistan said its jets had forced back the Indian planes and denied there were any casualties.\nRelations between the countries were strained by a militant attack on Indian troops in Kashmir earlier this month.\nIndia accuses Pakistan of allowing militant groups to operate on its territory and says Pakistani security agencies played a role in the suicide attack on 14 February, which was claimed by JeM and killed 40 Indian troops.\nPakistan denies any role and says it does not provide safe haven to militants.\nBalakot is in Pakistan's north-western Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Residents there told BBC Urdu they were woken by loud explosions. Pakistan condemned the strike and said it would respond \"at the time and place of its choosing\".\nThe strikes are the first launched across the line of control - the de facto border that divides India-administered Kashmir from Pakistan-administered Kashmir - since a war between the two countries in 1971.\nBoth India and Pakistan claim all of Muslim-majority Kashmir, but control only parts of it. The nuclear-armed nations have fought three wars and a limited conflict since independence from Britain in 1947 - and all but one were over Kashmir. \nIndian Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale told a news conference that the strikes had killed a \"large number\" of militants, including commanders, and had avoided civilian casualties.\n\"Credible intel [intelligence] was received that JeM was planning more suicide attacks in India. In the face of imminent danger, a pre-emptive strike became absolutely necessary,\" he said.\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not directly mention the air strikes when he addressed a political rally in Rajasthan later on Tuesday but he told cheering crowds: \"I understand your enthusiasm and your energy. Today is a day we bow before our heroes.\"\nIndia is due to hold elections by the end of May. \nIn Srinagar city, in Indian-administered Kashmir, residents expressed concerns over the spike in tensions. \"Whatever is happening between these two hostile neighbours, it's us who are in the middle of this war theatre,\" Shabir Aakhoon, a banker, said. \nLocal reporter Sameer Yasir says a heavy military build-up in the past three days has caused panic. Anticipating full-scale war, civilians have stockpiled food and crowded petrol pumps, triggering traffic jams in many places, he adds.\nPakistan's army spokesman Major General Asif Ghafoor said the strikes caused no casualties. He tweeted that Pakistani jets were scrambled and forced the Indian planes to make a \"hasty withdrawal\", dropping their payload in an open area.\nPakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan later convened an urgent meeting of national security chiefs and condemned \"irresponsible Indian policy\".\n\"Once again [the] Indian government has resorted to a self-serving, reckless and fictitious claim,\" a statement issued after the meeting said. \"This action has been done for domestic consumption, being in an election environment, putting regional peace and stability at grave risk.\"\nMr Khan has summoned a special meeting of the National Command Authority (NCA) - the body that oversees Pakistan's nuclear arsenal - to take place on Wednesday, officials said.\nAnalysis by M Ilyas Khan, BBC News, Islamabad\nThe Indian air strikes that hit a target inside Pakistani territory have taken tensions to a dangerous level.\nIn September 2016, an attack on an Indian army base in Uri created a similar situation when Delhi decided to respond with so-called \"surgical strikes\".\nIndia's claims that they airdropped special forces to destroy militant camps on the Pakistani side of Kashmir were found to be largely exaggerated, but Indian troops did cross at several points along the Line of Control (LoC), inflicting some casualties on Pakistani forces.\nThis time they have hit a target across the international border, inside Pakistani territory, at a location where a training camp of Kashmiri militants is known to have existed for several years.\nPakistan's military has cordoned off the area and not even the local police are allowed in, so it will be some time before details of the attack become known.\nAlso, Pakistani officials have been underplaying the severity of the incident by describing it as a strike \"across the LoC\", not one across the international border.\nPakistan has vowed to respond but this may not go beyond diplomatic measures. However, as some observers point out, there may be punitive attacks by militants against Indian forces in Kashmir \"at an appropriate time\".  \nOctober 1947: First war between India and Pakistan over Kashmir just two months after they become independent nations.\nAugust 1965: The neighbours fight another brief war over Kashmir.\nDecember 1971: India supports East Pakistan's bid to become independent.
