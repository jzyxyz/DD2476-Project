{"title": "2016 Election Coincided With Horrifying Increase In Anti-Muslim Hate Crimes, Report Finds", "content": "A prominent American Muslim civil liberties group says it recorded a nearly 600 percent rise in hate crimes targeting Muslims over the past three years \u2015 an increase the organization attributes to a presidential election cycle rife with anti-Muslim animus.\nIn a report released Tuesday called \u201cThe Empowerment of Hate,\u201d the Council on American-Islamic Relations says it recorded over 2,200 \u201canti-Muslim bias incidents\u201d in 2016, a 57 percent increase from the year before.\u00a0\nAmong those 2,200 incidents last year were 260 anti-Muslim hate crimes, the report states. That\u2019s a 44 percent rise from 2015, when CAIR counted 180 hate crimes, and a staggering 584 percent increase from 2014, when the group counted just 38 hate crimes.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cThis report shows not only that anti-Muslim bias incidents have increased sharply, but also that there is a disturbing trend toward the increasing use of violence against American Muslims and those perceived to be Muslim,\u201d Corey Saylor, director of CAIR\u2019s department to monitor and combat Islamophobia and co-author of the report, said in a statement this week. \u00a0\nSaylor told HuffPost that CAIR defined a hate crime as any incident that had elements that could lead to either state or federal hate crime charges. Common hate crimes last year included assaults, acts of mosque vandalism or arson, and threats.\u00a0\nAmong the hate crimes listed in CAIR\u2019s report are the assault of a Muslim man in New York by an assailant shouting \u201cISIS\u201d; the shooting of a teenager in Ohio by a man who called him a \u201cterrorist\u201d and a \u201cTaliban bitch\u201d; a man in Missouri threatening a Muslim family with a gun and yelling\u00a0\u201cYou Muslim? All of you should die\u201d; and the foiled plot of three right-wing militia members in Kansas to massacre Somali immigrants.\u00a0\nExamples of anti-Muslim incidents that weren\u2019t hate crimes included workplace discrimination, noncriminal harassment, denial of service, and incidents of anti-Muslim discrimination perpetrated by U.S. government agencies.\u00a0\nAmong the worst government offenders, CAIR states, is the FBI, which \u201cregularly contacts individuals in order to question and interrogate them about their religious views and to surveil the Muslim community to gather general intelligence, rather than to acquire specific information regarding a credible crime or threat.\u201d\nIn its report, CAIR acknowledges that its data \u2015 collected predominantly from complaints sent directly to CAIR, which its staffers then verify \u2015\u00a0offers a \u201cmere snapshot of the experiences of the American Muslim community.\u201d\u00a0\nThere are, after all, hate or bias incidents not reported to CAIR, or incidents that escape the group\u2019s efforts to track them. Bias incidents are \u201cvastly underreported to both law enforcement and community institutions,\u201d CAIR wrote in its report.\u00a0\nAmerican Muslims, the group wrote, \u201cwill often not report incidents such as harassment and bullying since there is a certain level of desensitization.\u201d Muslims in this country, the report states, often feel like \u201cnothing can be done\u201d when they\u2019re harassed for their faith, feeling that such incidents \u201chave become normal.\u201d\u00a0\nStill, CAIR\u2019s report Tuesday offers yet another compelling data point proving there\u2019s been a sharp rise in anti-Muslim hate in America since the beginning of the latest presidential election cycle, which saw a man who said \u201cIslam hates us\u201d claim victory.\nFBI numbers show hate crimes against Muslims rose 67 percent in 2015, the latest year for which the agency has statistics, rising to a rate not seen since 2001.\n(The FBI\u2019s numbers, however,\u00a0are widely considered to be insufficient, as the federal law enforcement agency relies on local police departments to voluntarily turn over their hate crime data each year. Many police departments either don\u2019t report their data to the FBI, or incorrectly report zero hate crimes.)\u00a0\nHuffPost\u00a0tracked nearly 400 incidents of anti-Muslim violence, vandalism, policy and political speech in 2016.\u00a0\nAnd a Southern Poverty Law Center report earlier this year said the number of anti-Muslim hate groups tripled in 2016.\u00a0\nIn its report, CAIR points to a series of polls showing many Americans holding a dim view of Islam and Muslims. A survey from Morning Consult in March 2016, for example, found that 84 percent of American voters supported \u201ca temporary ban on Muslims traveling to the United States\u201d and 49 percent supported \u201cadditional law enforcement patrols\u201d of \u201cMuslim neighborhoods\u201d \u2015 whatever that means.\u00a0\n\u201cDangerous political rhetoric combined with deeply negative views of Islam and Muslims throughout 2016,\u201d CAIR said in Tuesday\u2019s report. \u201cThis brew, mixed with the erroneous placement of collective blame on every individual Muslim for the acts of a noxious few, contributed to a significant and distressing rise in incidents of Islamophobic bias incidents.\u201d\u00a0\nThe report points to how public figures have the power to either \u201cincite or defuse the social environment,\u201d particularly after terror attacks. \u201cFor instance,\u201d the report states, \u201cformer President George W. Bush\u2019s speech at a Washington, DC mosque is often cited as playing a key role in defusing anti-Muslim backlash following the 9/11 terror attacks.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWhen Donald Trump became President of the United States on January 20, 2017, he brought an unprecedented record of conditioning audiences to fear Muslims,\u201d the report continues.\nTrump, after all, called for the creation of a national database of Muslims, the\u00a0surveillance of mosques,\u00a0and the profiling of Muslims.\u00a0He was fond of telling an apocryphal story about shooting Muslims with bullets dipped in pig\u2019s blood, and once suggested that the Muslim mother of a fallen American soldier wasn\u2019t allowed to talk.\nAfter the terror attack in a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, he falsely stated that American Muslims don\u2019t report \u201cbad\u201d people to law enforcement. And after the terror attack in San Bernardino, California, in December 2015, he proposed a Muslim ban.\u00a0\nIn the days directly following that proposal, there was an 87.5 percent increase in hate crimes against Muslims, according to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino.\u00a0\nHuffPost also identified at least 13 times\u00a0last year that Trump supporters attacked, threatened or plotted to kill American Muslims. \u00a0\nCAIR\u2019s report doesn\u2019t lay the blame for rising hate crimes wholly at Trump\u2019s feet, however, pointing to a slew of predominantly Republican politicians across the country, including many presidential candidates, who routinely disparaged and scapegoated Muslims.\u00a0\nRick Santorum, who briefly ran for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination, falsely stated that the Constitution doesn\u2019t protect the the religious liberties of Islam in the same way as it does for Christianity. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, another primary candidate,\u00a0stated that there are only a \u201chandful of reasonable, moderate followers of Islam.\u201d\nAnd GOP presidential candidate Ben Carson routinely promoted the thoroughly debunked a \u201ccivilization jihad\u201d conspiracy theory, which holds that Muslims are somehow secretly plotting to take over the U.S. \u00a0\u00a0\nAmerica does not do a good job of tracking incidents of hate and bias. We need your help to create a database of such incidents, so we all know what\u2019s going on.
