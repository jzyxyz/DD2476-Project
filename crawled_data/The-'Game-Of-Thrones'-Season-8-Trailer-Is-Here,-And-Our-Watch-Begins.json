{"title": "The 'Game Of Thrones' Season 8 Trailer Is Here, And Our Watch Begins", "content": "Winter is here, and so is the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d Season 8 trailer.\nSince late last year, HBO gifted fans with multiple teasers that didn\u2019t feature new footage and a number of\u00a0Season 8 photos\u00a0and posters that revealed as little as possible. Finally, after all this time, the old gods and the new have answered our prayers.\u00a0\nWhen Season 7 ended almost two years ago, Jaime Lannister (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) was riding north, a pregnant Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey) was deceiving everyone in King\u2019s Landing, Jon Snow (Kit Harington) and Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) were getting intimate on their journey to Winterfell, and Tyrion Lannister (Peter Dinklage) was looking very worried on a boat.\u00a0\nNow, our watch begins ...\nThe trailer starts with Arya\u00a0(Maisie Williams) wounded and, seemingly, running for her life:\nA recent \ufeffEW interview\u00a0apparently described Williams\u2019 look during the upcoming big battle at Winterfell as \u201cultra-grimy with dirt and mock blood on her face,\u201d so these shots may be from that sequence. On filming the battle, Williams said, \u201cthere are moments you\u2019re just broken as a human and just want to cry.\u201d (That\u2019s how Leigh and I feel after a short jog, so if Williams had to do that run over and over, yeah, we get it.)\nThe trailer also features quick shots of basically all the main characters, including a long-awaited confirmation that Beric (Richard Dormer) and Tormund (Kristofer Hivju) survived after the Night King broke through the Wall:\nAt one point, the footage becomes a \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d sequel, starring Daenerys and Jon:\nHeadey recently told HuffPost she broke down in tears after wrapping on \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d but there\u2019s no sign of that here, as Cersei and Qyburn (Anton Lesser) seem pretty pleased they double-crossed everyone in the North:\nOur boy Gendry (Joe Dempsie) finally makes an appearance, ending our #WheresGendry campaign:\nAnd there are a ton of shots of everyone looking concerned, matching the emo aesthetic of the Season 8 photos:\nThen, of course, winter arrives, and the White Walkers make it to Winterfell:\nSeason 8 drops on April 14. All fans must watch.", "date": "\n03/05/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/game-of-thrones-season-8-trailer_n_5c785e5ee4b0de0c3fbf4ca4", "tags": "shots everyone season watch trailer \u201d lannister winter winterfell thrones begins williams"}
