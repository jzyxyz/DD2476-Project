{"title": "Pompeo Questions the Value of International Groups Like U.N. and E.U.", "content": "BRUSSELS \u2014 In a major speech on Tuesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tried to explain one of the abiding conundrums of the Trump administration: How does a nationalist lead on the international stage?\nThe answer, he said, is to revamp or jettison some treaties and institutions while bolstering others.\nAmong the institutions that Mr. Pompeo criticized were the United Nations, the European Union, the Organization of American States and the African Union. But he embraced NATO, which President Trump has harshly criticized, as an \u201cindispensable institution.\u201d\nThe speech, delivered in a palatial hall in Brussels, was intended to explain Mr. Trump\u2019s worldview to a deeply skeptical audience, including many Europeans who see Mr. Trump as undermining international agreements that have kept the peace in Europe and enhanced prosperity.\n\u201cEven our European friends sometimes say we\u2019re not acting in the free world\u2019s interest. This is just plain wrong,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said, adding that \u201cunder President Trump, we are not abandoning international leadership or our friends in the international system. Indeed, quite the contrary.\u201d\nBut since the end of the Cold War, the international order \u201cfailed us, and it failed you,\u201d he said. \u201cMultilateralism has become viewed as an end unto itself. The more treaties we sign, the safer we supposedly are. The more bureaucrats we have, the better the job gets done.\u201d\nOf the United Nations, he asked, \u201cDoes it continue to serve its mission faithfully?\u201d\nMr. Pompeo called Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union a \u201cpolitical wake-up call\u201d for the bloc, which is based in Brussels. He then asked whether the European Union \u201cis ensuring that the interests of countries and their citizens are placed before those of bureaucrats here in Brussels?\u201d\nSomeone in the audience shouted an unequivocal, \u201cYes,\u201d a response Mr. Pompeo ignored.\nThe World Bank, International Monetary Fund and World Trade Organization also came in for sharp criticism.\n\u201cInternational bodies must help facilitate cooperation that bolsters the security and values of the free world, or they must be reformed or eliminated,\u201d he said. After the short speech, Mr. Pompeo took no questions.\nResponses ranged from tepid to hostile. In addition to Mr. Trump\u2019s regular criticism of NATO, the United States and the European Union are fiercely at odds over the Iran nuclear deal, which Mr. Trump has pulled out of while America\u2019s main European allies seek to preserve it.\nWashington and Brussels are also engaged in sometimes vicious negotiations about trade as well as American sanctions on European steel on the grounds of \u201cnational security.\u201d\nThe Trump administration is also threatening new tariffs on imported cars, in an effort to reduce the American trade deficit with the European Union. And Washington has sharply criticized Germany for supporting the Nordstream II, a gas pipeline from Russia to Germany now under construction.\nMr. Pompeo\u2019s challenge to the European Union was a surprisingly undiplomatic comment from America\u2019s chief diplomat.\nA spokesman for the European Union disputed the claim that the bloc fails the member states and their people. Margaritis Schinas, chief spokesman of the European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive arm, explained its governing structure and system of popular elections, adding pointedly, \u201cI\u2019m simplifying for those who do not know us.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s how it works, O.K.?\u201d Mr. Schinas said, throwing his hands in the air. \u201cSo for those people who come to Brussels and coin an opinion without knowing how our system works, that\u2019s how our system works, and that\u2019s our reply.\u201d\nIan Lesser, director of the Brussels office of the German Marshall Fund of the United States, which organized the event, said: \u201cClearly this was a speech intended to signal that multilateralism wasn\u2019t dead, it simply needed to be revived.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it was a destructive message about multilateralism per se,\u201d he said.\nSome listeners were less sanguine, like David Fouquet, a professor at the Free University of Brussels.\n\u201cI was struck by the fact that he put the European Union on his administration\u2019s hit list of bad actors,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m in disbelief: the tone, the lack of sensitivity to the place where he was.\u201d\n\u201cHis predecessors built and created these institutions,\u201d Mr. Fouquet said. \u201cAlthough he professes to want to strengthen them, I think he is undermining them.\u201d\nMr. Pompeo\u2019s audience listened for clues about the future of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, known as the I.N.F. treaty, which the Trump administration has threatened to jettison despite European opposition. For years, American officials have maintained that Russia was violating the treaty, which banned land-based missiles of certain ranges.\n\u201cWhen treaties are broken, the violators must be confronted, and the treaties must be fixed or discarded,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said, in a preview of a threat he delivered hours later to walk away from the agreement if Russia fails to correct violations.\nMr. Lesser said that \u201cfor now I heard no sign suggesting that America is prepared to go back on its apparent commitment to withdraw from the nuclear treaty, unless of course something happens on the Russian side, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s very likely.\u201d\nMr. Pompeo said that some international institutions \u201cwork in American interests and yours, in service of our shared values.\u201d He listed only three such bodies: NATO, the Proliferation Security Initiative and the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, the bank messaging service known as Swift.\nJohn R. Bolton, the national security adviser, threatened to penalize Swift, which gives financial institutions a secure way to wire money around the world, if it did not remove Iran\u2019s banks from the system. Despite opposition from the European Union, Swift acceded to American demands.\n\u201cThis is an excellent example of an international institution acting responsibly,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said.\nAlthough NATO also received praise from Mr. Pompeo, he repeated Mr. Trump\u2019s frequent complaint that the other 27 nations in the alliance need to spend more on defense. He then announced that he would host foreign ministers in Washington in April to celebrate the alliance\u2019s 70th anniversary.\nIt would be the first time that a major NATO birthday was celebrated without heads of state.\nNATO officials said that there may be another summit meeting of leaders later in the year that could be portrayed as timed for the anniversary.\nIn closing, Mr. Pompeo cited a quote from George Marshall, who as secretary of state after World War II helped design the modern international system, declaring that \u201cinternational action cannot replace self-help.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not popular to buck the status quo,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said. \u201cBut too much is at stake not to. This is the reality which President Trump so viscerally understands.\u201d\n\u201cPresident Trump knows that when America leads, peace and prosperity follow,\u201d he added.", "date": "Dec. 4, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/04/world/europe/pompeo-brussels-speech.html", "tags": "groups european e.u value union \u201d brussels pompeo questions international like said u.n."}
