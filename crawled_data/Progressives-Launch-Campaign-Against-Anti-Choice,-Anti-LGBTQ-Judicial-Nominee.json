On Wednesday, 10 organizations urged Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee to reject the nominee.\u00a0\n\u201cBush has expressed biased and offensive positions on wide-ranging issues,\u201d reads a letter from the groups, including NARAL Pro-Choice America, the American Federation of Teachers and MoveOn. \n\u201cHe likened abortion to slavery, calling these issues \u2018the two greatest tragedies in our country,\u2019\u201d the letter continues. \u201cHe applauded [former GOP presidential contender] Mike Huckabee for saying he \u2018strongly disagree[s]\u2019 with \u2018the idea of same-sex marriage.\u2019 Writing about the 2016 election, Bush claimed that Democrats were just trying to \u2018substitute woman for Black.\u2019\u201d\nBush has also mocked climate change, and he celebrated that \u201cthe witch is dead\u201d when he thought the Affordable Care Act might not be enacted.\nThe full letter is here (story continues below):\nA White House spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment.\nProgressive groups dug up many of these details about Bush from a blog he maintained\u00a0on a right-wing website called\u00a0Elephants in the Bluegrass. He used the\u00a0pseudonym \u201cG. Morris,\u201d\u00a0which he disclosed in a questionnaire that all judicial nominees submit to the Judiciary Committee.\nThe organizations plan to mobilize their members \u2015 millions of people \u2015 to pressure Democrats and Republicans on the committee to reject Bush. NARAL, which is leading the campaign, has dubbed him a\u00a0\u201cshady blogger\u201d and is publicizing his record of pushing anti-choice policies during his time with the conservative Center For Constitutional Jurisprudence.\nThe reproductive rights group has experience waging war on a court nominee: It\u00a0helped tank one of President Barack Obama\u2019s court picks, Michael Boggs, a conservative Democrat from Georgia who drew the ire of progressives because of his anti-choice, anti-LGBTQ, anti-civil rights record.\nAnother group, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, announced Wednesday that it will also fight Bush\u2019s nomination.\n\u201cJohn K. Bush is unworthy of a lifetime appointment as a federal judge,\u201d said Vanita Gupta, the organization\u2019s president and CEO. \u201cHis extreme ideology and record clearly shows an open and unabashed hostility to women and LGBT people, campaign finance reform, and Democrats. ... We urge the Senate to reject this nominee.\u201d\nFor now, progressives are focused on building momentum against Bush before he faces the committee with the power to approve or deny his nomination.", "date": "\n06/07/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-judicial-nominee-lgbt-abortion_n_5938179fe4b0c5a35c9ae02a", "tags": "progressives judicial bush \u2018 groups launch democrats anti-choice committee nominee \u201d anti-lgbtq \u2015 campaign"}
