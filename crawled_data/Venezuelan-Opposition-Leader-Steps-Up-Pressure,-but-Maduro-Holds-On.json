{"title": "Venezuelan Opposition Leader Steps Up Pressure, but Maduro Holds On", "content": "It was the boldest move yet by Juan Guaid\u00f3, Venezuela\u2019s opposition leader: at sunrise, he stood flanked by soldiers at an air force base in the heart of the capital, saying rebellion was at hand.\nMutinous security forces supporting him had released the country\u2019s most famed political prisoner. National guardsmen stood at Mr. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s side as others joined marches to support the protesters that they had spent years repressing.\nIn the streets, anti-government demonstrators clashed with forces loyal to the president amid reports of live fire, rubber bullets and tear gas. A health clinic in Caracas took in 69 people injured during the day. An armored vehicle rammed protesters, but it was not immediately clear how many people were hurt.\nYet at the end of the day, Mr. Guaid\u00f3 fell short of the prize he sought: the toppling of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who has relied on force, intimidation and widely discredited elections to remain in power.\nThe events also cast a harsh new light into the division within the armed forces, which puts Venezuela in a precarious position as the country\u2019s political crisis deepens. While the highest ranks of the military dig into their support for Mr. Maduro\u2019s government, many rank-and-file soldiers appear willing to defy their commanders and come to the aid of the opposition.\n\u201cI think ultimately what we\u2019re going to see coming out of this is both the government and the opposition recognizing that their hands were not as strong as they thought they were,\u201d said Geoff Ramsey, an analyst at the Washington Office on Latin America, a human rights group.\nThe gamble by Mr. Guaid\u00f3 was brazen: A predawn takeover of a military base in the heart of the capital, Caracas. The deep symbolism of such an act, it was hoped, would help galvanize soldier and citizen alike to end Mr. Maduro\u2019s authoritarian rule.\nThe Trump administration immediately came out in support of the opposition, with the president, vice president and others publicly stating their approval on Twitter. President Trump also threatened \u201ca full and complete\u201d embargo on Cuba if it did not stop what he called \u201cmilitary and other operations for the purpose of causing death and destruction to the Constitution of Venezuela.\u201d\nThe Trump administration, which has backed Mr. Guaid\u00f3 since he first challenged Mr. Maduro\u2019s authority more than three months ago, clearly thought the day would unfold differently.\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo, speaking on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer,\u201d said Mr. Maduro and senior leaders in his government had been prepared to fly to Cuba on Tuesday morning, with \u201can airplane on the tarmac,\u201d but that Russia, a powerful ally of Mr. Maduro\u2019s, had \u201cindicated he should stay.\u201d Mr. Pompeo offered no evidence.\nJohn R. Bolton, the White House national security adviser, said top officials in Mr. Maduro\u2019s government had committed to transitioning power to Mr. Guaid\u00f3. He identified them as Vladimir Padrino L\u00f3pez, the defense minister, Maikel Moreno, the head of the Supreme Court, and Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez Dala, the commander of Mr. Maduro\u2019s presidential guard.\n\u201cAll agreed Maduro had to go,\u201d Mr. Bolton said. But Mr. Padrino and Mr. Moreno both came out publicly in defense of Mr. Maduro on Tuesday.\nSince January, Mr. Guaid\u00f3 has run what amounts to a parallel government, counting on support from more than 50 countries, including the United States, even as Mr. Maduro remains the country\u2019s leader. Despite Mr. Maduro\u2019s low popularity, however, the opposition\u2019s momentum has been sapped as Mr. Guaid\u00f3 has failed to depose the president or solve the shortages of food, medicine, water and power that plague the country\u2019s 30 million people.\nBut if there had been any likelihood that top military brass would turn sides Tuesday, it seemed quashed by early afternoon when Mr. Padrino L\u00f3pez, the defense minister, spoke on television, calling the act \u201can attempt at a coup, without a doubt, at a mediocre level.\u201d\nThe defense minister also came flanked by soldiers, but they pledged loyalty to Mr. Maduro and vowed to hunt down those responsible.\nBy day\u2019s end, news spread of another blow to the opposition: Leopoldo L\u00f3pez, the political prisoner who heads Mr. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s party, had fled into the Chilean Embassy, along with his wife, Lilian Tintori. Only hours earlier, Mr. L\u00f3pez had appeared freed from house arrest imposed by Mr. Maduro\u2019s government.\nVenezuelans in Caracas said they were bracing for a revived but protracted struggle between Mr. Maduro and Mr. Guaid\u00f3, with an unclear outcome.\n[Here\u2019s what we know so far.]\n\u201cI believe this is very important, but I see apathy and fear in people,\u201d said one of the protesters, Mary Galaviz, 69. \u201cWe should not be afraid. In war there is death, but goals are achieved.\u201d\nMiriam Segovia, 52, another protester near the military base, said she hoped that the armed forces would \u201cput themselves on the side of the Constitution, so we can escape this misery, this hunger and lack of medication.\u201d\nThe response was far more mixed \u2014 and chaotic.\nIn a video broadcast online, an armored vehicle could be seen accelerating directly into a group of protesters, leaving at least one person lying on the road behind it. In a separate series of photos, an armored vehicle appeared to run over a protester.\nTear gas canisters could be seen detonating near the military base, where about 2,000 people had gathered by around noon. About 200 people converged near the president\u2019s Miraflores Palace, in Caracas, in support of Mr. Maduro\u2019s government. Some were armed.\nAt least 69 people were wounded, according to Salud Chacao, one of the hospitals attending them.\nThe scenes drew condemnations from governments around the region. Eleven countries, including Venezuela\u2019s neighbors Colombia and Brazil, issued a statement denouncing what they called \u201cthe indiscriminate use of violence to repress the transition process.\u201d\nThe countries, known regionally as the Lima Group, encouraged the military to back Mr. Guaid\u00f3. They called for a meeting to discuss the situation on May 3.\nRoc\u00edo San Miguel, a security analyst in Caracas, said Mr. Guaid\u00f3 had failed to get the majority of the armed forces to switch sides.\n\u201cIt took twelve hours, but we saw that the balance of power hadn\u2019t shifted,\u201d said Ms. San Miguel. \u201cIn the end the scenario they got was that none of the important commanders joined the opposition.\u201d\nBut she said it was also telling that the armed forces had arrested neither Mr. Guaid\u00f3 nor Mr. L\u00f3pez, the political prisoner, presumably fearing a backlash for detaining the popular leaders.\n\u201cThis situation is not easy for Maduro either,\u201d she said.\nOn Tuesday night, Mr. Maduro appeared with top military and civilian leaders in a televised address to denounce Mr. Guaid\u00f3 and Mr. L\u00f3pez, whom he characterized as American puppets. He called the day\u2019s events a coup attempt and claimed that the opposition never got control of the military base, but rather was easily fended off by loyal soldiers there.\n\u201cWe will continue to be victorious in every juncture that follows,\u201d he said. \u201cOur cause is crystal clear. It\u2019s the cause of the defense of the country.\u201d He denied Mr. Pompeo\u2019s assertion that he was ready to fly to Cuba, and called for a march on Wednesday \u201cto win the peace.\u201d\nMr. Guaid\u00f3 appeared in a video message Tuesday night, urging Venezuelans to head to the streets for a May Day protest of \u201cpeaceful rebellion.\u201d\nThe fate of Mr. L\u00f3pez, now hiding in the Spanish Embassy, also promised a new wrinkle going forward.\nMr. L\u00f3pez is the country\u2019s most well-known political prisoner, sentenced to nearly 14 years after having led street protests against Mr. Maduro in 2014. In the morning, Venezuelans woke to the sight of him freed, standing beside Mr. Guaid\u00f3, saying soldiers who supported the opposition had released him.\n\u201cThis is a movement of the people with the armed forces,\u201d he told reporters gathered around him.\nBut by evening, Chile\u2019s foreign minister, Roberto Ampuero, announced that Mr. L\u00f3pez and his wife were at the Spanish Embassy after a period of hiding at the Chilean one.\nIt was unclear whether Mr. L\u00f3pez had requested asylum. An opposition lawmaker, Freddy Guevara, sought refuge in the Chilean ambassador\u2019s residence in November 2017 and remains there.\nThere was less clarity for Venezuela\u2019s politics, said Dimitris Pantoulas, a political analyst in Caracas. By forcing only Mr. L\u00f3pez into hiding, Mr. Maduro had neither ended Mr. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s challenge nor allowed him to gain a new opening by freeing a popular leader.\n\u201cNeither side can impose itself on the other,\u201d he said.", "date": "April 30, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/30/world/americas/venezuela-guaido-maduro.html", "tags": "venezuelan guaid\u00f3 opposition \u201c maduro military holds leader pressure steps l\u00f3pez"}
