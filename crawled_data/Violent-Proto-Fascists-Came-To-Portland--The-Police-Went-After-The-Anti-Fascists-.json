{"title": "Violent Proto-Fascists Came To Portland- The Police Went After The Anti-Fascists-", "content": "PORTLAND, Ore. \u2015 Police did a good job on Saturday preventing what could have been the most violent far-right rally since last year\u2019s deadly \u201cUnite the Right\u201d gathering in Charlottesville, Virginia \u2014 all they had to do was protect the proto-fascists who came to town, and use riot control weapons, flash-bang grenades and chemical irritants against anti-fascist counter-protesters. \nFor hours, dozens of officers in full riot gear stood across a closed section of Naito Parkway along the Willamette River, keeping the two sides apart. On one side of the parkway, in Tom McCall Waterfront Park, stood hundreds of out-of-towners\u00a0belonging to the Proud Boys \u2014 a punch-drunk far-right group of self-described \u201cWestern chauvinists\u201d dressed in helmets and body armor \u2014 and those aligned with Patriot Prayer and its leader Joey Gibson, a Republican Senate candidate from Washington state who has held a series of increasingly violent rallies in the Pacific Northwest since 2017.\n Both groups have deep ties to white supremacists.\nOn the other side of the parkway stood hundreds of counter-protesters belonging to a broad coalition of local anti-fascist, anti-racist and social justice groups. They had a clear message: This is our city. Get out. \n\u201cWe remember Charlottesville!\u201d they chanted.\nReferring to the 32-year-old counter-protester at last August\u2019s gathering who was run down by a car, they yelled, \u201cYou got Heather Heyer killed!\u201d\nThey chanted the names of Ricky Best and Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche, two men allegedly killed by a white supremacist named Jeremy Christian last year in Portland when they tried to stop Christian from threatening two black teenage girls. (The month before the murders, Christian had attended a Patriot Prayer rally.) \nThe counter-protesters held signs detailing the assaults and other crimes allegedly committed by Proud Boys and Patriot Prayer members in the Portland area.\nAnd yet, when police decided the standoff was too tense for comfort, they targeted the local anti-fascists. As officers lobbed flash-bang grenades\u00a0at them \u2014 ear-piercing explosives that temporarily disorient the senses \u2014 \u00a0Proud Boys and Patriot Prayer members cheered on the cops, claiming victory against the \u201cviolent leftists\u201d they\u2019d come expecting to fight themselves. \nOne police flash-bang canister reportedly pierced an anti-fascist\u2019s helmet, cutting into his head. \u201cI\u2019m certain he would be dead if he wasn\u2019t wearing a helmet,\u201d 39-year-old Jenny Nickolaus, an anti-fascist demonstrator and friend of the victim, told HuffPost. \u201cThe trauma nurse said as much.\u201d\nPortland Police Sgt. Chris Burley told HuffPost he was \u201cnot aware of anyone that received medical treatment for injuries suffered by actions of law enforcement today. If someone reported being injured by police action today we would like to speak with them.\u201d\nAt the \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville, the former happened, ending with a neo-Nazi allegedly driving a car into a crowd of anti-racist protesters, killing\u00a0Heyer and injuring 19 others.\nOn June 30 in Portland, the city declared a riot after police let Patriot Prayer and Proud Boys brawl with anti-fascists in the streets. Some half a dozen people were sent to the hospital after the day\u2019s chaos, one with a brain hemorrhage.\nThere were fears that Saturday\u2019s rally would be even worse. But this time police successfully kept the sides separated \u2014 yet as they have at other Patriot Prayer gatherings, they targeted counter-protesters with their weapons and defended those aligned with white supremacy.\n\u201cPolice launched a violent attack on the left that was unprovoked in an attempt to allow Patriot Prayer and Proud Boys to go on their march,\u201d said Effie Baum, spokesperson for Popular Mobilization, a coalition of anti-racist and anti-fascist groups formed for today\u2019s counter-demonstration. \n\u201cWhen people say there was no violence today between the right and left, there was absolutely violence, and it was perpetrated by the police on the left.\u201d\nAt about 2 p.m., cops warned anti-fascist demonstrators that they needed to move west, away from the parkway, or \u201cface arrest\u201d and \u201cimpact weapons.\u201d\n The reason for this initial order was confusing. The police claimed they spotted anti-fascists with weapons, but HuffPost saw Patriot Prayer members and Proud Boys armed with weapons as well (and police confiscated some of them).\n The police claimed that the anti-fascists were blocking traffic \u2014 but in order to protest against Patriot Prayer and the Proud Boys, there was, at times, nowhere else to stand but in the road. HuffPost did not witness anti-fascist protesters provoke or attack police before the initial dispersal order. \nThe anti-fascists didn\u2019t budge. And police launched their attack.\u00a0\nA cat-and-mouse game ensued throughout downtown Portland, with cops chasing after anti-fascists from corner to corner, demanding each time that they disperse or face arrest. More flash-bangs. More tear gas. A handful of anti-fascists then started to hurl rocks and water bottles at the riot police. \n\u201cThe groups involved in the protests escalated in behavior and threw projectiles, including rocks, smoke bombs, firework mortars, unknown chemical agents, bottles, items from a slingshot, and other projectiles at officers and protesters,\u201d the Portland Police Bureau said in a statement. \nPolice also claimed that, at one point, they \u201clearned multiple police vehicles, possibly with officers inside them, were trapped in a group of protesters who were throwing an unknown chemical agent as well as other projectiles at officers.\u201d\nPolice ultimately found no officers inside the vehicles, but did say three police vehicles sustained some damages.\nPolice said they arrested four people on a slew of charges that included resisting arrest, disorderly conduct, attempted assault, harassment, assault on an officer and unlawful use of a weapon (a slingshot).\nBaum said four Popular Mobilization counter-protesters were arrested. \nAs cops chased anti-fascists through the streets, Patriot Prayer and Proud Boys were also on the move, marching west from the river into downtown. (A couple had been injured, having reportedly walked through a throng of anti-fascists, and had cuts on their heads.) They were flanked by police in riot gear, who never engaged them despite demanding that they disperse several times.\nThe Patriot Prayer and Proud Boy demonstrators eventually ran into the anti-fascists, and cops rushed to keep the two sides separated. Police then declared the day\u2019s demonstration a \u201ccivil disturbance\u201d and ordered both sides to disperse or face arrest and the use of \u201criot control agents and impact weapons.\u201d \nPatriot Prayer and the Proud Boys made their way back to the waterfront park, where they cooled off in a fountain and celebrated what they claimed was a victory. \nTusitala \u2018Tiny\u2019 Toese, a Proud Boy and Patriot Prayer member implicated in the May\u00a0assault of an anti-Trump person in the Portland area, donned a \u201cPinochet Did Nothing Wrong\u201d T-shirt, referring to the far-right fascist Chilean dictator who murdered tortured or detained some 40,000 of his own people.\n\u201cMake communists afraid of rotary aircraft again,\u201d read the back of Toese\u2019s shirt, referring to the penchant of forces loyal to Augusto Pinochet of throwing political rivals out of helicopters. (Toese\u2019s shirt was made by a white nationalist clothing company called Right Wing Death Squads.) \nAsked by HuffPost how he thought Saturday\u2019s rally went, Toese described it as \u201cawesome\u201d and \u201cbeautiful.\u201d The Portland police, he said, \u201cdid their job.\u201d \n\u201cToday was a victory for America!\u201d he later told a group of his cheering supporters. \nLater, journalist Brendan O\u2019Connor reported on Twitter that some Proud Boys \u201csprayed bear mace\u201d at a group of anti-fascists as they drove out of Portland.\u00a0\nAnti-fascists across America have long accused police of siding with, and protecting, white supremacists and fascists. Earlier this year in Newnan, Georgia, heavily militarized police charged at anti-fascists demonstrating against a neo-Nazi rally, pointing guns in their faces.\n\u201cWe expected state repression,\u201d Baum said.\nStill, Baum added, it was the anti-fascists who were actually victorious. The left, Baum said, is often marred by divisions between more militant \u201cblack bloc\u201d anti-fascists and more liberal, non-violent protesters. \nSaturday saw \u201ca very unified anti-fascist opposition\u201d of some 1,500 people that \u201cquite literally almost made me cry,\u201d Baum said. \nBy Baum\u2019s count, they outnumbered Patriot Prayer and the Proud Boys by four to one.\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this story incorrectly said that Chilean dictator Pinochet murdered an estimated 40,000 of his countrymen. Pinochet murdered, tortured or detained that number.\nAmerica does not do a good job of tracking incidents of hate and bias. We need your help to create a database of such incidents across the country, so we all know what\u2019s going on.\u00a0Tell us your story.", "date": "\n08/05/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/portland-patriot-prayer-proud-boys-police-antifascists_n_5b668b7de4b0de86f4a22faf", "tags": "boys portland proto-fascists prayer portland- came \u201d proud violent went anti-fascists- police anti-fascists patriot"}
