{"title": "Ford Cancels Focus Crossover For U-S- Consumers After Trump's Trade War Tariffs", "content": "Ford Motor Company announced on Friday it\u2019s ditching plans to bring its new Focus crossover to the U.S., thanks to President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war that imposes new tariffs on cars that are assembled in China.\nThe Ford Focus Active is manufactured in China, but because of the new\u00a0tariffs, which can be up to 25 percent, it\u2019s no longer profitable for the company to sell it in America. Ford had predicted consumers would buy close to 50,000 of the vehicles annually.\n\u201cGiven the negative financial impact of the new tariffs, we\u2019ve decided not to import this vehicle from China,\u201d Kumar Galhotra, Ford president of North America, said in a Friday conference call with reporters.\u00a0\nThe company had planned to start shipping the Focus Active to the U.S. later next year.\u00a0It is already\u00a0selling it in China and Europe.\nThe decision could mean that the Mustang will be the only Ford passenger car sold in the U.S.\u00a0\nFord has said that nearly 90 percent of the vehicles it sells by 2020 will be SUVs, trucks or commercial vehicles.\u00a0\nThe company sells 2.5 million cars a year, so the Focus Active decision isn\u2019t hugely significant, but it could be a harbinger of other cuts by Ford or other American car companies because of tariffs, reducing choice for U.S. customers.\nThis is likely the first of \u201cmany such announcements,\u201d warned Kristin Dziczek, vice president of the Ann Arbor-based Center for Automotive Research. She predicts tariffs on Chinese imports, along with Trump\u2019s additional threatened 25 percent tariff on cars and possibly parts from the European Union, would force several vehicles out of the American market.\n\u201cThis is the first of potentially many vehicles that will disappear from the U.S. market,\u201d she told The Detroit Free Press. \u201cThe threat or the imposition of a 20 to 25 percent tariff will limit consumer choices and raise prices in the U.S.\u201d\nShe said 48 percent of the vehicles sold in the U.S. were imported last year, and even vehicles that aren\u2019t imported have a significant percentage of foreign parts. \u201cAll of that imported content could be subject to tariffs as well. Even a U.S. vehicle made in the U.S. and sold in the U.S. will see prices rise due to imported content [being] subject to tariffs,\u201d she warned.\nDave Sullivan, manager of product analysis at marketing firm AutoPacific Inc., told The Free Press that Trump\u2019s\u00a0\u201cwar on the automotive industry is causing a knee-jerk reaction that will only bring higher costs and less choice for consumers.\u201d\nTariffs could be coming at a bad time for Ford, whose stock last month dipped below $10 for the first time in almost six years. The shares dropped another 2.3 percent Friday to $9.48.\nAbout 80 percent of Ford cars are made in the U.S., according to Galhotra. The company outsourced some of its manufacturing because profit margins in the U.S. were falling.", "date": "\n09/01/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ford-focus-active-a-victim-of-trumps-trade-war_n_5b8a1404e4b0cf7b003629ae", "tags": "company percent u-s- vehicles crossover u.s. cancels trump \u201d focus war tariffs trade new ford consumers"}
