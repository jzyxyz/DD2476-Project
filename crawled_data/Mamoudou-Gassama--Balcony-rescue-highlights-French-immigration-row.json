{"title": "Mamoudou Gassama: Balcony rescue highlights French immigration row", "content": "If you come to France without the right papers and you want to get French citizenship, then it's really quite simple.\nAs the case of Mamoudou Gassama goes to show, all you have to do is pull off something \"exceptional\".\nActually that is not being flippant. It is in the civil code.\nArticle 21-19 says that a fast-track naturalisation procedure is possible for a foreign national who has \"performed exceptional services for France, or whose naturalisation would be of exceptional interest for France\".\nThis is what President Emmanuel Macron was invoking when he congratulated the young Malian at the Elys\u00e9e palace and told him his papers would be in the post.\nBeing a nation founded on a set of self-declared values, France has always been open to the idea of an \"honorary\" French citizenship - a way of elevating worthy foreigners whose actions have defended or propagated those values.\nBack in the early days of the Revolution, there was a law that gave citizenship to those \"who by their writings and their courage have served the cause of freedom\". Beneficiaries included George Washington and Thomas Jefferson.\nMuch later, in 1870, a decree offered citizenship to people who had fought alongside France in the war against Germany. Most of those who benefited at the time were actually Germans.\nAnd of course there is also the special case of the Foreign Legion, which since the 1830s has offered a chance to fight for France to soldiers of other nations.\nContrary to popular belief, Foreign Legion soldiers do not get automatic French citizenship, except if they are wounded in action. Today - with the legion employing 8,600 soldiers from 150 countries - there are about 200 naturalisations a year.\nBut all these precedents were set in the days before mass immigration. Today it is different.\nToday there are hundreds of thousands of young men in France who - like Mr Gassama - arrived after a long and dangerous journey, have no proper papers and survive (just about) by working in the black economy.\nAnd all of them would dearly love to follow his example.\nIn such circumstances there was bound to be heavy scrutiny of the president's decision.  \nIn fact, just about everyone agrees that what Mr Gassama did in saving the boy was sufficiently extraordinary to merit fast-track citizenship.  \nBut what some people hold against the president is inconsistency. \nWhy, his detractors are asking, do you not apply the same generosity to the rest of the sans-papiers (paperless ones) - all those other Mamoudou Gassamas whose daily misery goes unreported? Why single out one lucky individual?\nTheir indignation is all the sharper because right now an immigration bill is passing through parliament which - in the eyes of the left - puts President Macron clearly in breach of France's historic mission to humanity.\nWhether his proposed law is nearly as tough or inhumane as his enemies say it is is another matter. \nWhat is not in doubt is the goal: it is to make matters as clear as possible, as early as possible, to would-be immigrants. If they can stay, they stay. If they have to leave, they leave. They are deported.\nIn his conversation with Mr Gassama, President Macron made clear that had it not been for his chance encounter with a badly supervised child on a hot day, Mr Gassama himself would have been on that list for deportation.\nBut things turned out differently. Mr Gassama reacted with an instinctive generosity of spirit, he performed an act of supreme courage and agility and it was all caught on camera.\nFor President Macron, eager to promote his vision of France as a nation of heroes, this was enough. The act was indeed exceptional and the beneficiary was not just the boy, it was La France.
