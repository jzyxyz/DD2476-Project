One blast hit near the zoo in Dehiwala, southern Colombo, and an eighth was reported near the Colombo district of Dematagoda during a police raid, killing three officers. \nThe government has said most of the attacks are thought to have been carried out by suicide bombers.\nThe vast majority of those killed are thought to be Sri Lankan nationals, including dozens who were attending Easter church services.\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs says five British people - including two with joint US citizenship - are among the dead. The US State Department has said \"several\" Americans have been killed.\nThree Danish citizens, two Turkish nationals and one person from the Netherlands were also killed, their governments have confirmed. \nSri Lankan officials say three Indian nationals and one Portuguese citizen are also among the dead. \nThey say 25 more fatalities at a Colombo mortuary are also thought to be international citizens awaiting identification. \nAirlines have said people are still able to travel to the airport under the curfew if they produce their boarding pass and identification at checkpoints.\nTravellers are being advised to arrive at the airport four hours before their scheduled flight time.\nPrime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe addressed the media on Sunday evening.\nDuring the briefing, he referred to allegations that officials had been in possession of intelligence suggesting an impending attack.\n\"We must look into why adequate precautions were not taken. Neither I nor the Ministers were kept informed,\" he said.\n\"For now the priority is to apprehend the attackers,\" he added.\nPope Francis, in his traditional Urbi et Orbi speech at the Vatican, condemned the attacks as \"such cruel violence\" targeting Christians celebrating Easter.\nA spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has said he is \"outraged\" by the attacks, and hopes the perpetrators will be \"swiftly brought to justice\".\nCardinal Archbishop of Colombo, Malcolm Ranjith, told the BBC: \"It's a very difficult and a very sad situation for all of us because we never expected such a thing to happen and especially on Easter Sunday.\"\nUK PM Theresa May tweeted condolences, saying the \"acts of violence against churches and hotels in Sri Lanka are truly appalling\".\nUS President Donald Trump tweeted \"heartfelt condolences\" for the \"horrible terrorist attacks\".\nSunday's attacks are the deadliest seen in Sri Lanka since the end of the country's civil war in 2009.\nThe civil war ended with the defeat of the Tamil Tigers, who had fought for 26 years for an independent homeland for the minority ethnic Tamils. The war is thought to have killed between 70,000 and 80,000 people.\nThe nation has seen some sporadic violence since.  In March 2018 a state of emergency was declared after members of the majority Buddhist Sinhala community attacked mosques and Muslim-owned properties. \nTheravada Buddhism is Sri Lanka's biggest religious group, making up about 70.2% of the population, according to the most recent census.\nIt is the religion of Sri Lanka's Sinhalese majority. It is given primary place in the country's laws and is singled out in the constitution.\nHindus and Muslims make up 12.6% and 9.7% of the population respectively.\nSri Lanka is also home to about 1.5 million Christians, according to the 2012 census, the vast majority of them Roman Catholic.\nAre you in Sri Lanka?
