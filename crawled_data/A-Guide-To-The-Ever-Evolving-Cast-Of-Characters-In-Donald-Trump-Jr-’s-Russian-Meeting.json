{"title": "A Guide To The Ever-Evolving Cast Of Characters In Donald Trump Jr-\u2019s Russian Meeting", "content": "The eldest son of President Donald Trump met with a Russian lawyer in June of 2016 after being promised information linked to the Russian government that would \u201cincriminate\u201d Democrat Hillary Clinton, the clearest indication yet that Trump\u2019s campaign may have colluded with Russia in last year\u2019s presidential election. \nSince the New York Times first reported the meeting on July 8, a geyser of evolving statements and dubious explanations\u00a0have emerged about the meeting, provided by Trump Jr. and others in the president\u2019s orbit, as well as more reporting about exactly who attended the session \u2015 details that have often contradicted the Trump team.\nHere\u2019s a guide to who we know was at the meeting.\nBefore agreeing to the meeting, Trump Jr. was promised information on Clinton that was \u201cpart of Russia and its government\u2019s support for Mr. Trump,\u201d according to emails he released last Tuesday.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s what you say I love it,\u201d Trump Jr. wrote in a follow-up email.\nHe included Kushner and Manafort on the email chain, and both men attended the meeting at New York\u2019s Trump Tower, despite Trump Jr. initially claiming that there was nothing important about the get-together.\nKushner, the only member of the trio who is currently a top White House official, is the reason the Times first discovered the meeting. He omitted the meeting from his national security form required to obtain his top-secret security clearance, raising further questions about his conduct. Knowingly concealing such information is a federal crime.\nTrump Jr. initially claimed that Veselnitskaya was at the meeting to discuss adoptions, referring to the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 U.S. law that enacted sanctions on several Russian officials. In retaliation, the Kremlin imposed a ban on Americans adopting Russian children. Veselnitskaya has advocated against the sanctions. It\u2019s unclear whether she was working directly with the Russian government in her efforts, but she has previously represented Russian officials and state-owned businesses.\nAfter the Times revealed that Trump Jr. had been offered damaging information on Clinton before taking the meeting, he changed his story to suggest that the information was just a ruse.\nOn Tuesday, Veselnitskaya denied offering such information, saying that Trump Jr. may have heard incorrectly because he wanted such information \u201cso badly.\u201d\n\u201cIt is quite possible that maybe they were looking for such information. They wanted it so badly that they could only hear the thought that they wanted,\u201d she told NBC News, through a translator.\nLater that day, Trump Jr. released the emails detailing the meeting.\nGoldstone, who sent the emails arranging the meeting, has acknowledged to several news outlets that he was also present. In addition, Goldstone posted a Facebook update on the day of the meeting that indicated he was at Trump Tower.\nGoldstone, a colorful character whose lavish lifestyle includes frequent social media updates on his jet-setting, arranged the meeting at the request of his client, Russian singer Emin Agalarov. When he was still a reality TV star, Trump appeared in one of Agalarov\u2019s music videos. The singer\u2019s father, Aras, is a real estate developer who had tried to collaborate with Trump on a project in Moscow. \nIn an initial statement explaining the meeting, Trump Jr. described Goldstone as \u201can acquaintance I knew from the 2013 Miss Universe Pageant,\u201d which the elder Trump then owned. That year, Goldstone and the Agalarovs persuaded Trump to hold the event in Russia.\nOn Friday, the Associated Press and NBC News reported that at the meeting, Veselnitskaya was accompanied by Akhmetshin. Veselnitskaya\u2019s\u00a0organization, working to overturn the Magnitsky sanctions, hired Akhmetshin as a lobbyist in April 2016.\nThough he has been suspected as a spy, Akhmetshin denied that he had any formal espionage training while serving as a Soviet military officer, telling the AP that he worked in a unit \u201cloosely part of counterintelligence.\u201d He also denied having current ties to the Kremlin.\nThe only meeting attendee so far not affiliated with either Trump\u2019s team or the Russian officials, Samochornov is a New York-based interpreter who had previously been hired by Veselnitskaya, who does not speak English.\n\u201cThis is my livelihood and I hope you can be sympathetic to the predicament I find myself in,\u201d he told HuffPost on Friday. \u00a0\nSamochornov could now become a key witness in the multiple investigations into the links between the Trump campaign and Russia.\nSeveral news outlets, including CNN and Fox News, have reported yet another person sat in on the meeting. A source told CNN that the person could be a representative of the Agalarov family.\nOn Tuesday, CNN and\u00a0The Washington Post confirmed that the person was Ike Kaveladze, who works for the Agalarovs\u2019 real estate company and attended the June 2016 meeting as their representative.\nThis story has been updated with the identity of another person who attended the meeting.", "date": "\n07/16/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/who-was-at-trump-jr-meeting_n_596b9cdae4b0d6341fe9a0ba", "tags": "jr. characters news russian jr- veselnitskaya goldstone meeting cast trump guide donald \u201d ever-evolving information"}
