{"title": "A Great Leap Into the Abyss", "content": "BEIJING \u2014 The document, written by Communist Party investigators as famine raged in China in 1961, reads almost like a cookbook.\nIn Qiaotou district, in Sichuan Province, \u201cAn old lady named Luo Wenxiu was the first to start consuming human flesh,\u201d investigators wrote. \u201cAfter an entire family of seven had died, Luo dug up the body of the 3-year-old girl, Ma Fahui. She sliced up the girl\u2019s flesh and spiced it with chili peppers before steaming and eating it.\u201d The report, dated Feb. 9 of that year, is one of more than 100 astonishing documents collected by the historian Zhou Xun in a new book about Mao Zedong\u2019s Great Leap Forward, published by Yale University Press.\nIn another, an investigator recounted how the body of a 5-year-old Sichuan boy provided \u201cfour separate meals\u201d for his mother, who strangled him with a towel first. \u201cSuch shocking and disturbing incidents are by no means unique,\u201d the investigator, Wang Deming, wrote in the report dated Jan. 27.\nUnlike the horrors of the Soviet gulag or the Holocaust, what happened in China during the Great Leap Forward has received little attention from the larger world, \u201ceven though it is one of the worst catastrophes in twentieth-century history,\u201d writes Ms. Zhou, an assistant professor of history at the University of Hong Kong, in the introduction to \u201cThe Great Famine in China, 1958-1962.\u201d\n\u201cIn China itself, the famine is a dark episode, one that is not discussed or officially recognized,\u201d she writes.\nAnd while there have been other recent books \u2014 notably \u201cTombstone\u201d by the Chinese journalist Yang Jisheng, and \u201cMao\u2019s Great Famine\u201d by the Dutch historian Frank Dik\u00f6tter \u2014 what distinguishes Ms. Zhou\u2019s is that it simply presents documents of the time, from sources that include reports by central and local officials, party investigation teams, minutes of official meetings, citizens\u2019 letters and reports of the police investigations into theft, murder and cannibalism.\nJust as the mass murder of Poles by the Soviet secret police in Katyn in 1940 was confirmed with the revelation of the original execution orders signed by Stalin, she hopes that by showing original documents from the famine, readers will learn that \u201cwhat took place is really beyond any doubt,\u201d despite the Chinese government\u2019s 50-year silence.\nMs. Zhou and a growing number of Chinese \u2014 and some Western \u2014 scholars believe the Great Leap Forward, Mao\u2019s campaign of breakneck industrialization and agricultural collectivization, resulted in the deaths of perhaps 45 million people, mostly in the countryside. People died from a combination of starvation, overwork and violence in the quest for a perfect Communist society.\nTo document that, Ms. Zhou spent four years, starting in 2006, visiting dozens of county and provincial archives, some under military guard. Access was easier during the first two years of her research, a legacy, she believes, of the rule of former President Jiang Zemin. Still, she often gained access only through informal contacts, she said, declining to be more specific. In all, she photocopied, photographed or transcribed about 1,000 documents. (Ms. Zhou also conducted more than 100 interviews with survivors, to be published by Yale in a separate book.)\nThe reports portray a society where abuse of power was commonplace and the death toll from starvation or violence exceeded 50 percent of the population in some areas. An elaborate vocabulary of violence developed: In Hunan, investigators from the provincial party committee found that in 11 communes in Liling County, 120 people were beaten during meetings that inaugurated a political campaign, with 20 seriously wounded or dying. \u201cMore than twenty types of torture were employed, most of them extremely dangerous,\u201d including hanging people up like pigs to be slaughtered, investigators wrote. To \u201cdouble cook\u201d meant repeated beatings. \u201cTie up firewood\u201d was to beat a bound victim. \u201cWhite up and black down\u201d referred to hauling a naked person onto a stage and beating him until he was discolored.\nEverywhere, people starved, as collectivization led to reduced output, the government requisitioned grain and people were forced to eat in communal canteens where rations were controlled by the people in charge. Orphans in homes in Fushun, Sichuan Province, ate dead rats out of toilets, the provincial Bureau of Civil Affairs reported in May 1962. People howled for food, ate mud \u2014 and eventually each other.\nOther stories are disturbing in different ways, such as the hundreds of women forced to work topless alongside topless men in Wugang County in Hunan Province in order, ostensibly, to increase production. \u201cSince the day we came out of our mother\u2019s wombs, we had never felt so humiliated,\u201d Du Laojiu and Zhou Laochun were quoted as saying in a report officials from the county supervision committee, dated Dec. 18, 1958.\nNow, archives are shutting down again, Ms. Zhou says, with previously accessible documents sometimes even removed from catalogs, perhaps during the recent digitalization ordered by the State Archives Bureau. History is being silenced anew, she said by telephone.\n\u201cThey are weeding out a lot of things,\u201d said Ms. Zhou.\nWhy?\n\u201cIn China this kind of thing happens regularly,\u201d she said. The authorities \u201cloosen it up a bit,\u201d then they close down again.\n\u201cIn a way it\u2019s fear, it\u2019s deliberate, so people don\u2019t know what is going on,\u201d she said. \u201cYou constantly worry, so you do self-censor, because you don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going to happen tomorrow. I think it\u2019s terror, basically. It creates a kind of terror.\u201d", "date": "SEPT. 5, 2012", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/06/world/asia/06iht-letter06.html", "tags": "china leap great documents \u201d abyss famine ms. zhou \u2014"}
