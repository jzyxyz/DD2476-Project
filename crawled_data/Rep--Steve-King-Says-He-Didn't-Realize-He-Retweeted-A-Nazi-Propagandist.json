{"title": "Rep- Steve King Says He Didn't Realize He Retweeted A Nazi Propagandist", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2015 Congressman Steve King (R-Iowa) said Thursday he didn\u2019t realize he was retweeting a guy with Nazi sympathies.\nKing had retweeted an account Tuesday that posted an image of a Breitbart.com story about an immigration poll. The account happens to belong to a British white supremacist.\n\u201cThat was a Breitbart story,\u201d King told reporters Thursday, describing his thought process when he sent the tweet. \u201cI recognized the format of it. I\u2019m walking between meetings. I don\u2019t know the names of who wrote the article or who might have tweeted it. I\u2019ve never heard them, and I still don\u2019t know them.\u201d \nA reporter asked King if he knew the tweet had been written by a Nazi sympathizer. \n\u201cI still don\u2019t know that,\u201d King said. \n\u201cEurope is waking up... Will America... in time?\u201d King\u2019s tweet said, linking to an anti-immigrant tweet from Mark Collett, one of Britain\u2019s most high-profile white supremacists. Collett has described himself as a \u201cNazi sympathizer,\u201d has talked admiringly of Adolf Hitler and regularly appears on racist podcasts alongside white supremacists like David Duke. \nOn Wednesday, HuffPost confronted King about the tweet, but he refused to comment. \nOn Thursday, he again tweeted \u201cEurope is waking up\u2026 will America\u2026 in time?\u201d This time, however, he linked to a Breitbart News article instead of Collett\u2019s tweet. \u201cThis is my message from Breitbart to America,\u201d he added in the new version. King pointed to the new tweet when reporters asked about the previous one. When HuffPost asked if he would delete the old tweet, he said he had to have a business meeting with a staffer.\nAs of this writing, King has not yet deleted his original tweet promoting Collett\u2019s account. He previously retweeted Collett in May. Collett\u2019s YouTube oeuvre includes videos downplaying the historical significance of slavery and the Holocaust, and suggesting Jews are undermining Western society through pornography. \nThe House of Representatives is in the midst of an immigration debate, with conservatives calling for increased deportations and decreased legal immigration, and liberals pushing for legalized status for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children. King said he\u2019ll vote against any bill that provides \u201camnesty\u201d for undocumented immigrants. \n\u201cI want the American people to get the message something is happening in Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been there. I\u2019ve been in and out of the no-go zones across Europe over and over again, and they\u2019re not aware of it and I want people to be aware of it. It\u2019s the message, not the messenger.\u201d\nKing has a long history of making racist remarks, often signaling his support for outright white nationalism. His blatant bigotry, however, has gone largely unpunished in Washington. \nMore than a dozen House Republicans told HuffPost on Thursday that they were unaware their colleague had promoted a white supremacist on Twitter.\n\u201cI don\u2019t even look at my own tweets, much less somebody else\u2019s,\u201d Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.) said. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about it.\u201d\nRep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.) noted that President Donald Trump has also been known to endorse dubious Twitter accounts. She said retweeting a random person can be a dangerous business. \n\u201cI\u2019m always worried when I retweet somebody because, sheesh, I don\u2019t know who they are, and maybe they tweeted something [bad] in the past,\u201d she said. \u00a0\nRep. David Schweikert (R-Ariz.) said members of Congress shouldn\u2019t deliberately retweet Nazis. \u201cIf someone did something like that knowingly, they owe everyone apologies.\u201d", "date": "\n06/14/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/congressman-steve-king-nazi-tweet_n_5b22dba4e4b0a0a52779f388", "tags": "propagandist realize steve know thursday tweet nazi \u201d white europe says retweeted king rep- collett"}
