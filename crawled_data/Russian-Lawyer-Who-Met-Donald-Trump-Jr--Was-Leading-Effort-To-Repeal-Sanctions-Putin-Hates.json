{"title": "Russian Lawyer Who Met Donald Trump Jr- Was Leading Effort To Repeal Sanctions Putin Hates", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2015 The Russian lawyer President Donald Trump\u2019s son, son-in-law and campaign chairman met last year with the understanding she would provide damaging information the Russian government had acquired on Hillary Clinton was simultaneously leading a lobbying effort to repeal U.S. sanctions that Russian President Vladimir Putin loathes.\nNatalia Veselnitskaya, a lawyer for a powerful Russian oligarch and government official, met with Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort on June 9, 2016, at Trump Tower, according to emails Trump Jr. released Tuesday. Veselnitskaya never delivered the damaging information on Clinton, Trump Jr. told\u00a0The New York Times. But her interests were nevertheless in sync with the Kremlin\u2019s: She was working to repeal the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 law that imposed sanctions on several Russian officials and businessmen.\nMoscow was \u201coutraged\u201d by the Magnitsky sanctions, Putin\u2019s then-deputy foreign minister said in 2012, and the Russian government retaliated by banning Americans from adopting Russian children.\nVeselnitskaya never registered as a foreign agent, and it\u2019s not clear whether she had Moscow\u2019s financial support in her campaign to reverse the American law. But her efforts were extensive. Last year, she headed a Washington-based nonprofit, the Human Rights Accountability Global Initiative Foundation, that describes itself as \u201cdedicated to overturning the Russian adoption ban.\u201d\u00a0The group provided the main lobbying thrust for powerful Russian oligarchs and top directors of state-backed entities who were allied with their government in trying to roll back the sanctions, according to lobbying disclosure forms filed with the U.S. Senate.\nVeselnitskaya\u2019s group hired Rinat Akhmetshin, a Russian-American former Soviet military officer once described as a \u201cgun-for-hire,\u201d to lobby Congress in April 2016. In May it brought on Cozen O\u2019Connor lawyer Howard Schweitzer, a former official at the Export-Import Bank. In June, as it ramped up its lobbying campaign, her group hired former Democratic Rep. Ron Dellums of California.\nThe law Veselnitskaya was fighting against is named after Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer and accountant who accused Russian officials in 2008 of orchestrating a $230 million tax fraud scheme. He was accused of tax evasion and died in jail days before he would have had to be put on trial or released.\nWilliam Browder, the CEO of Hermitage Capital Management and one of Magnitsky\u2019s clients, aggressively lobbied Congress to pass sanctions to avenge his friend\u2019s death. Once a major foreign investor in Russia, Browder had fallen out of favor with Putin and is now exiled from the country.\nVeselnitskaya first clashed publicly with Browder \u2014 and the Magnitsky Act \u2014 in 2013, soon after Congress enacted the law.\nThat September, the Justice Department accused Denis Katsyv of laundering money obtained through a Russian tax fraud scheme uncovered by Magnitsky. His company, Prevezon, hid the proceeds of the $230 million scheme in high-end real estate in Manhattan, then-U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara alleged. Katsyv, a client of Veselnitskaya\u2019s,\u00a0is the son of Petr Katsyv, the vice president of state-owned Russian Railways and former vice governor of the Moscow region.\u00a0\nBrowder was the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s key source in Bharara\u2019s investigation of Katsyv, according to a 2014 deposition by Todd Hyman, a DHS special agent.\nTop Russian officials hoped the U.S. would not win the case. If Denis Katsyv lost, it would affirm Browder\u2019s version of events and \u201cundoubtedly would have precedential value in many countries,\u201d Yuri Chaika, the general prosecutor of Russia, warned in a letter to Kommersant Magazine in December 2015. Chaika, who was the source of the purported negative information on presidential rival Clinton, according to the emails Trump Jr. released Tuesday, also wrote in the letter that the Magnitsky Act was passed on the basis of lies spread by Browder.\nThe government settled the case in May, with Prevezon agreeing to pay\u00a0$6 million. Katsyv did not admit to any wrongdoing.\nBy last summer, Browder and Magnitsky became the focus of Veselnitskaya and her nonprofit\u2019s lobbying.\nIn April 2016, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) traveled to Russia on a congressional trip. Rohrabacher met with top Russian government officials who handed him documents that cast doubt on the stories of Browder and Magnitsky and a letter that said Russia would relax its ban on U.S. adoptions if more congressmen would question the Magnitsky story, according to a November 2016 Politico report. Back in the U.S., Rohrabacher\u2019s staff helped introduce HRAGI lobbyists to congressmen.\nAround this time, Veselnitskaya traveled to the U.S. She wasn\u2019t licensed to practice law in the U.S., but she worked with Katsyv\u2019s American legal team and traveled periodically to New York to attend hearings and assist on the case. She was chosen as Moscow\u2019s emissary in the June 2016 meeting with Trump Jr. and Trump campaign advisers in part because she was already planning to be in New York, according to emails published by The New York Times. Veselnitskaya told\u00a0The Washington Post that she agreed to meet with Trump Jr. at the request of a friend \u2015 not because she was instructed to by the Kremlin.\nVeselnitskaya didn\u2019t simply organize the anti-Magnitsky group; she continued to attend events related to the Magnitsky Act throughout her summer 2016 visit to the U.S. Four days after the meeting at Trump Tower, she attended a Washington, D.C., screening of a controversial film that claimed that, rather than revealing corruption, Magnitsky was guilty of tax fraud himself. According to the film, which was directed by occasional Putin critic Andrei Nekrasov, Browder fabricated the Magnitsky narrative to make the Russian government\u2019s case against his friend appear politically motivated.\nThe day after the screening, Veselnitskaya attended a congressional hearing about U.S. policy toward Russia. She submitted a report to lawmakers showing how Browder \u201cdeceived the U.S. administration\u201d into passing sanctions in honor of Magnitsky, she told the Russian state-owned media outlet Sputnik. \nBrowder\u2019s Hermitage Capital Management filed a complaint last July with the Justice Department accusing Veselnitskaya, Akhmetshin and others of failing to register as foreign agents for their work on behalf of HRAGI. In the complaint, Hermitage alleges that Veselnitskaya helped organize screenings of Nekrasov\u2019s film about Magnitsky. \nSoon after Browder\u2019s complaint, HRAGI began amending its filings to disclose its foreign backers who would benefit from its lobbying. They included Denis Katsyv, Veselnitskaya\u2019s client; Vladimir Lelyukh, deputy to the general director of Sberbank Capital, a subsidiary of the state-owned Sberbank, the largest bank in Russia; Berryle Trading Inc., an offshore corporation registered in the British Virgin Islands by way of Switzerland; and two other individuals, Mikhail Ponomarev and Albert Nasibulin. \nBrowder told HuffPost he plans to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing next week on Veselnitskaya\u2019s effort to repeal the Magnitsky Act. \nVeselnitskaya told The Washington Post that she planned to discuss the Magnitsky Act in her 2016 meeting with Trump Jr. but after a few minutes \u201cit was clear we were talking about two different things.\u201d She dismissed allegations that her meeting with Trump Jr. was evidence that the Trump campaign colluded with a foreign power. \u00a0\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know what to do with your Trump so you are making up stories,\u201d Veselnitskaya told the Post. \u201cBecause someone in America really wants to overthrow their president. Overthrow him, I don\u2019t give a damn. Who gave you the right to come up with this stuff?\u201d", "date": "\n07/11/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-jr-russian-lawyer_n_59655e18e4b005b0fdc98b21", "tags": "sanctions jr. effort hates russian jr- repeal putin veselnitskaya magnitsky trump browder u.s. donald \u201d met leading lawyer"}
