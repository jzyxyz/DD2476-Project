{"title": "Prosecutors Say Trump Directed Illegal Payments During Campaign", "content": "Federal prosecutors said on Friday that President Trump directed illegal payments to ward off a potential sex scandal that threatened his chances of winning the White House in 2016, putting the weight of the Justice Department behind accusations previously made by his former lawyer.\nThe lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, had said that as the election neared, Mr. Trump directed payments to two women who claimed they had affairs with Mr. Trump. But in a new memo arguing for a prison term for Mr. Cohen, prosecutors in Manhattan said he \u201cacted in coordination and at the direction of\u201d an unnamed individual, clearly referring to Mr. Trump.\nIn another filing, prosecutors for the special counsel investigating Russia\u2019s 2016 election interference said an unnamed Russian offered Mr. Cohen \u201cgovernment level\u201d synergy between Russia and Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign in November 2015. That was months earlier than other approaches detailed in indictments secured by prosecutors.\nAnd in a separate case on Friday, the special counsel accused Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign chairman, of lying about his contacts with an individual they accuse of having ties to Russian intelligence, and about his interactions with Trump administration officials after he was indicted on criminal charges.\nTogether, the filings laid bare the most direct evidence to date linking Mr. Trump to potentially criminal conduct, and added to an already substantial case that Russia was seeking to sway the 2016 election in his favor.\nMr. Trump sought on Friday to dismiss the news,  claiming it \u201cTotally clears the President. Thank you!\u201d\nThe White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, was less unequivocal. \u201cThe government\u2019s filings in Mr. Cohen\u2019s case tell us nothing of value that wasn\u2019t already known,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cMr. Cohen has repeatedly lied and as the prosecution has pointed out to the court, Mr. Cohen is no hero.\u201d\nShe tried to distance Mr. Trump from the accusations against Mr. Manafort, who was convicted on financial fraud and conspiracy charges unrelated to his work for the Trump campaign. President Trump has repeatedly defended Mr. Manafort as a \u201cbrave man\u201d and dangled the possibility of a pardon for his 10 felonies, likely to result in a prison term of at least 10 years.\nThe revelations came in multiple filings by federal prosecutors for the Southern District of New York and by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. Their work has intersected because both teams have charged Mr. Cohen with crimes, and he had sought to cooperate with both.\n[Read the Southern District of New York\u2019s memo.]\n[Read the special counsel office\u2019s memo.]\nThe prosecutors in New York mounted a scathing attack on Mr. Cohen\u2019s character. They rejected his plea to avoid a prison term, saying that he had \u201crepeatedly used his power and influence for deceptive ends.\u201d\nThey argued that he deserved a \u201csubstantial\u201d prison term that, giving him some credit for his cooperation, could amount to just under four years. \u201cHis offenses strike at several pillars of our society and system of government: the payment of taxes; transparent and fair elections; and truthfulness before government and in business,\u201d they wrote.\nMr. Cohen, 52, is to be sentenced next week for campaign finance violations, financial crimes and lying to Congress about the extent of Mr. Trump\u2019s business dealings in Russia.\nMr. Cohen\u2019s crimes marked \u201ca pattern of deception that permeated his professional life,\u201d the Manhattan prosecutors wrote, saying that he did not deserve much leniency in exchange for his cooperation.\n\u201cThe sentence imposed should reflect the seriousness of Cohen\u2019s brazen violations of the election laws and attempt to counter the public cynicism that may arise when individuals like Cohen act as if the political process belongs to the rich and powerful,\u201d they said, adding that he \u201csought to influence the election from the shadows.\u201d\nThey emphasized that Mr. Cohen had implicated the president in payments to two women during the campaign to conceal affairs that they said they had with Mr. Trump. \u201cCohen himself has now admitted, with respect to both payments, he acted in coordination with and at the direction of Individual-1,\u201d the prosecutors wrote. \u201cIndividual-1\u201d is how Mr. Trump is referred to in the document.\nThe prosecutors have said that a $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels, a pornographic film actress, violated campaign finance law prohibitions against donations of more than $2,700 in a general election. A $150,000 payment by American Media Inc. to silence Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, constituted an illegal corporate donation to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, the prosecutors said.\nThe special counsel\u2019s prosecutors offered a somewhat more positive view of Mr. Cohen than the New York team, saying he went \u201cto significant lengths to assist\u201d their inquiry, including by providing relevant information he had learned from Trump Organization executives during the campaign.\nThey cited a series of disclosures during their seven meetings with Mr. Cohen. He revealed to them that he talked with Mr. Trump about meeting President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia during Mr. Putin\u2019s trip to New York for a United Nations session in September 2015. That was three months after Mr. Trump had declared his candidacy for president, at a time when Mr. Cohen was aggressively pursuing the building of a Trump hotel in Moscow that could generate hundreds of millions of dollars for the Trump Organization.\nAfter conferring with Mr. Trump, Mr. Cohen said, he reached out \u201cto gauge Russia\u2019s interest in such a meeting.\u201d It ultimately did not take place.\nTwo months later, Mr. Cohen said, he was approached by a Russian claiming to be a \u201c\u2018trusted person\u2019 in the Russian Federation.\u201d The individual, who was not named, offered \u201csynergy on a government level\u201d with the Trump campaign. He pushed for a meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin to discuss politics and the proposed hotel, saying Mr. Putin\u2019s consent was the biggest \u201cwarranty\u201d for any project.\nThat appears to be the earliest known contact between an aide to Mr. Trump and a Russian offering to help Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. The timing of the interaction matched one disclosed earlier this year by BuzzFeed.\nMr. Cohen said he never followed up on the Russian\u2019s invitation, in part because he was working with someone else who he believed had Kremlin connections. He also \u201cprovided information about attempts by other Russian nationals to reach the campaign\u201d and about his own interactions with Russian officials who might have tried to use the business proposal as leverage over Mr. Trump.\nHe also revealed that Mr. Trump had been more involved in discussions about the venture than was previously known. Although Mr. Cohen testified to Congress that negotiations ended in January 2016, before the first Republican presidential primary, he told prosecutors that those discussions had continued until June of that year, just before Mr. Trump won the Republican nomination and only five months before the election.\nBefore he testified falsely to Congress about the Moscow hotel project, Mr. Cohen has admitted, he consulted with White House staff members and Mr. Trump\u2019s legal team. The prosecutors characterized his information about his contacts with people tied to the White House over the past two years as \u201crelevant and useful information.\u201d\nMr. Cohen has said he lied out of loyalty to Mr. Trump and to be consistent with the president\u2019s \u201cpolitical messaging.\u201d His lawyers, Guy Petrillo and Amy Lester, have asked Judge William H. Pauley III to allow Mr. Cohen to avoid a prison sentence, saying he cooperated with prosecutors even though he never signed a formal agreement.\nThey portrayed him as a remorseful man whose life had been shattered by his relationship with Mr. Trump, who has lost friends and associates and who wanted to come clean so he could begin his life anew.\nUnder federal guidelines, Mr. Cohen faces about four to five years in the Manhattan case, and up to six months in Mr. Mueller\u2019s case. The special counsel suggested that any prison terms be served concurrently. But the guidelines are not binding, and Judge Pauley will decide his punishment.\nMr. Trump has accused Mr. Cohen of lying to prosecutors in hope of a lighter sentence. On Friday, he kept up his continuing effort to undermine public trust in the special counsel\u2019s office and in the Justice Department. In a series of Twitter messages, he derided Mr. Mueller as a friend of James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director who said the president fired him in May 2017 after demanding \u201cloyalty.\u201d\nAsked why the president was so upset about the special counsel, Roger J. Stone Jr., a fellow critic of Mr. Mueller, said it had dawned on Mr. Trump that the inquiry was not going away, his lawyers\u2019 promises notwithstanding. \u201cHe has finally figured out that this is about him,\u201d he said.\nSpurred on by the White House, House Republican lawmakers used their last days in control of the chamber\u2019s majority to press Mr. Comey Friday on what they claim is a pattern of abuse of power by the F.B.I. Mr. Comey reluctantly agreed to testify behind closed doors before two House committees \u2014 Judiciary and Oversight and Government Reform \u2014 after they agreed to release a public transcript of his testimony.\nLawmakers emerged frustrated that Mr. Comey had not been allowed to answer questions about classified matters involving the Mueller investigation, in which he is a central witness. Mr. Trump took up their complaints, tweeting that Justice Department lawyers had demonstrated \u201ctotal bias and corruption at the highest levels of previous Administration.\u201d\nEmerging after six hours of questioning, Mr. Comey defended the F.B.I.\u2019s actions in the Russia case, and accused Republicans of a misguided preoccupation with the bureau\u2019s handling its 2016 inquiry into Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server.", "date": "Dec. 7, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/07/nyregion/michael-cohen-sentence.html", "tags": "prosecutors \u201d trump directed say campaign cohen illegal payments special"}
