{"title": "Rockets From Gaza and Israeli Response Break Cease-Fire", "content": "JERUSALEM \u2014 As the latest short-term cease-fire between Israel and Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip collapsed Tuesday, rockets from Gaza reached Tel Aviv and Jerusalem and Israel resumed airstrikes in Gaza. But the most telling move came in Cairo, where Israel yanked its team from talks aimed at a more durable truce.\nThe prospect of a negotiated and lasting peace had seemed distant from the start of the Cairo talks as each side set bottom-line goals that the other rejected.\nAfter weeks of intermittent negotiations and fighting, analysts said that Israel\u2019s leadership might well have considered it preferable to let the conflict continue at a low simmer and end informally rather than give concessions that could be seen as rewarding militants who fired about 3,000 rockets into Israel, penetrated its territory through tunnels, and killed 64 soldiers over a month of bloody battle.\n\u201cMy approach would be not to go for any agreement with Hamas, because any agreement would give them something, and that\u2019s a mistake,\u201d said Dan Meridor, a former Israeli minister who served in several governments. \u201cIf the deal is seen by people as a victory for Hamas, that\u2019s bad for us, it\u2019s bad for the future, and bad for deterrence.\u201d\nIsrael\u2019s walking away from the talks leaves Hamas \u2014 and the broader Palestinian leadership that has been negotiating in Cairo \u2014 with little to show for its war effort. Gaza is devastated: About 2,000 residents were killed, mostly civilians, and perhaps 100,000 rendered homeless as neighborhoods were reduced to rubble.\nBuoyed in the Palestinian public for having achieved more militarily than in previous violent exchanges with Israel, Hamas is nonetheless under extreme pressure to deliver a tangible change to daily life in Gaza. During the war, the rising death toll put pressure on Israel. But during the cease-fire Hamas finds itself with diminished leverage, and so has resorted to threatening and provoking Israel.\nIt sent a flurry of rockets that reached Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, and on Monday the group\u2019s armed wing even invited a Reuters crew inside a tunnel like the ones through which it repeatedly attacked Israeli soldiers last month, showing off masked gunmen talking tough.\nMuhammad Walid Tushtash, who runs a supermarket in Gaza\u2019s Jabaliya refugee camp, reflected the hopes of many of his neighbors that the suffering would be compensated by Israel\u2019s yielding to Palestinian demands for a lifting of restrictions on travel and trade.\n\u201cThe definition of victory for us is when the occupation submits to the conditions,\u201d Mr. Tushtash, 29, said in a recent interview.\nThe Palestinian delegation had called for a complete lifting of what it calls Israel\u2019s siege on Gaza, the reopening of border crossings into Egypt and Israel and the building of a seaport and revival of an old airport in the crowded coastal territory. Israel demanded the demilitarization of Gaza with strict international controls to prevent the rebuilding of tunnels its troops destroyed.\nAs the temporary halt in hostilities was extended \u2014 from an original 72 hours last week, for five more days and then an additional 24 hours that was supposed to last until midnight Tuesday \u2014 people involved in the talks said these maximalist demands had been dropped, or postponed. \nThe focus was instead on more incremental changes in Israeli rules on imports and exports and on an internationally monitored rehabilitation of Gaza. For the Palestinians, it was too little and too late.\n\u201cIsrael\u2019s postponement and losing the determination to reach a final agreement is the main reason for the stalemate,\u201d Sami Abu Zuhri, a Hamas spokesman, said in a statement. \u201cThe occupation is wasting opportunities and should stop playing the game of time.\u201d\nBefore the cease-fire broke down Tuesday evening, another Hamas spokesman, Fawzi Barhoum, warned that if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel \u201cdoes not understand the message and the demands of Gaza through the political language of negotiations in Cairo, we know very well the way that will oblige him to understand it.\u201d\nHamas denied responsibility for the first round of rockets, fired before 4 p.m. local time. But by 11 p.m., it claimed credit for firing two toward Tel Aviv and two more toward Ben-Gurion International Airport, among others. The Israeli military said about 50 fell before midnight, including one on open ground in Jerusalem.\nAfter a few hours of quiet, several sirens signaling incoming rockets sounded Wednesday morning between 6 and 7 around Ashkelon, in southern Israel.\nIsrael responded to Tuesday evening\u2019s rockets with more than 25 airstrikes in Gaza, the military said, but it declined to specify targets. Witnesses said Israeli F-16 warplanes dropped at least four bombs on a Gaza City house around 9:30 p.m.; the Gaza-based Health Ministry said the strikes killed a man, a woman and a child, and injured 45 others.\n\u201cElectricity is off in the area, and a search among the rubble is going on,\u201d said Noor Al-Dalo, 28, a relative of the homeowner.\nIt was unclear on Tuesday night whether the renewed exchange would lead to an escalation, given the exhaustion of the publics on both sides. Israel, which has been condemned by world leaders for the high number of civilian casualties, may be granted some leeway to respond to fire, but that would be likely to disappear if the death toll began to rise quickly. While Hamas may see little choice but to continue launching rockets, analysts said the Palestinians need a deal more than Israel does.\nAzzam al-Ahmed, the head of the Palestinian negotiating team and an ally of President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority, said in a late-night news conference that his delegation would also leave Cairo but that he did \u201cnot consider that we have withdrawn from the negotiations.\u201d He blamed Israel for the failed talks, saying it did not respond to the Hamas demands.\nIsraelis have blamed Khaled Mashal, the exiled political leader of Hamas, and his Qatari sponsors for setting a hard line and thwarting progress.\nMr. Meridor, the former minister, and other analysts said that even without an agreement, Israel might unilaterally ease the movement of goods through its land crossings for the reconstruction of Gaza, in cooperation with Egypt and perhaps Europe.\n\u201cIsrael prefers to end the war without committing itself to lifting the siege in writing,\u201d said Mukhaimer Abusaada, a political scientist at Al-Azhar University in Gaza City. Accusing Israel of exploiting the rocket fire as \u201can excuse to sabotage the talks,\u201d he added, \u201cA unilateral decision by Israel to gradually lift the siege will deprive Hamas of a sense of victory after this destructive war.\u201d\nKobi Michael, a former head of the Palestinian desk at Israel\u2019s Ministry of Strategic Affairs, said Israel\u2019s move \u201cweakens Hamas \u2014 it kills it softly in front of its people.\u201d\n\u201cIsrael prefers a de facto cease-fire and reconstruction in a controlled manner in coordination with the Egyptians,\u201d said Mr. Michael, now at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv. \u201cIf Hamas is doomed to be a marginal player, it would prefer to be one without an agreement and not be marginal in an agreement.\u2019\nBut Sami Abdel Shafi, a Gaza-based consultant and political commentator, said Israel\u2019s unwillingness to make concessions, and the Palestinian leaders\u2019 lack of leverage to force them, left the people of Gaza in \u201cpotentially explosive\u201d despair.\n\u201cThe only place to look, and the appropriate place to look, is toward the international community and the United Nations,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have to seriously step up to the plate and defuse a situation they will be seen as responsible for if they don\u2019t come forward and push the Israeli government to recognize that people cannot be treated this way.\u201d", "date": "Aug. 19, 2014", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/20/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-strip.html", "tags": "hamas palestinian break \u201c cease-fire israel rockets gaza israeli response \u2014"}
