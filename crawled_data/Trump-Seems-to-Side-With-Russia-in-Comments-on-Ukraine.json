{"title": "Trump Seems to Side With Russia in Comments on Ukraine", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump cast doubt on whether Moscow is backing separatists engaged in the recent escalation of fighting in eastern Ukraine, appearing to side with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who has long denied involvement in the conflict despite evidence to the contrary.\nMr. Trump said he did not take offense at the outbreak of a lethal bout of fighting in Ukraine that came within a day of a phone conversation he had with Mr. Putin, saying of the recent clashes, \u201cwe don\u2019t really know exactly what that is.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re pro-forces,\u201d Mr. Trump said of the Ukrainian separatists in an interview that aired on Monday on \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor,\u201d on Fox News. \u201cWe don\u2019t know, are they uncontrollable? Are they uncontrolled? That happens also. We\u2019re going to find out; I would be surprised, but we\u2019ll see.\u201d\nMr. Trump\u2019s comments were the latest indication that his desire for warmer relations with Russia may be coloring his view of the conflict in Ukraine, which pits the country\u2019s military \u2014 trained and equipped in part by the United States Army \u2014 against Russian-backed separatists. Moscow has denied involvement in the three-year conflict, despite evidence that it has provided equipment and fighters to support separatist forces in eastern Ukraine.\nThe president\u2019s push for a friendlier relationship with Mr. Putin has alarmed Ukrainian officials, who fear that the pressure former President Barack Obama applied on Russia to withdraw its unacknowledged military forces from eastern Ukraine will wane.\nA telephone call Mr. Trump held on Saturday with President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine raised further questions about his position on the conflict and his administration\u2019s commitment to maintaining sanctions against Russia for the annexation of Crimea.\nIn an official account of the call, Mr. Trump had said he was willing to work with Kiev and Moscow to resolve the conflict. But the statement referred to helping to \u201crestore peace along the border,\u201d while the violence has been playing out inside eastern Ukraine.", "date": "Feb. 6, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/06/us/politics/ukraine-trump-putin-separatists-poroshenko.html", "tags": "ukraine seems side conflict trump \u201d eastern comments russia \u2014"}
