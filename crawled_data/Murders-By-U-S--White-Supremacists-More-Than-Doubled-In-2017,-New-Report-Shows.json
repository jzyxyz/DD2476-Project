{"title": "Murders By U-S- White Supremacists More Than Doubled In 2017, New Report Shows", "content": "White supremacists in the United States killed more than twice as many people in 2017 as they did the year before, and were responsible for far more murders than domestic Islamic extremists, helping make 2017 the fifth deadliest year on record for extremist violence in America, a new report states.\nThe report, \u201cMurder and Extremism in the United States in 2017,\u201d\u00a0published Tuesday by the Anti-Defamation League\u2019s Center on Extremism,\u00a0said extremists killed 34 people last year. Twenty of those victims \u2014 or 59 percent \u2014 were killed by right-wing extremists, a designation that includes white supremacists, members of the so-called \u201calt-right\u201d and \u201calt-lite,\u201d and members of the anti-government militia movement.\u00a0\nOf the 34 people killed, 18 were murdered by white supremacists, marking a 157 percent increase over the 7 people killed by white supremacists in 2016.\nThat\u2019s also double the number of people killed by domestic Islamic extremists in 2017. Nine people were killed by domestic Islamic extremists last year, according to the report, eight of whom died in a single attack in New York.\u00a0\nIn 2016, Islamic extremists were responsible for the bulk, about 71 percent, of domestic extremist murders in the U.S. This was largely an \u201caberration\u201d however, the report states, due to the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida, in which Omar Mateen killed 49 people and then pledged his allegiance to ISIS.\u00a0\n2017 marked a reversion back to the long-term trend in America, in which right-wing violence accounts for the majority of murders by domestic extremists.\u00a0\nFrom 2008 through 2017, according to the ADL, right-wing extremists have killed 274 people. That\u2019s 71 percent of the 387 murders committed by extremists over the past 10 years.\u00a0\n\u201cAmericans do not have the luxury to ignore any extremist threat, including threats posed by white supremacists who are weaponizing social media and are more likely to take their actions into the streets,\u201d Jonathan Greenblatt, the ADL\u2019s CEO, told HuffPost in a statement. \u201cTheir actions fuel controversy and conflict and their racist rhetoric and hateful ideas can inspire violence.\u201d\nThe horror of right-wing extremism gained national attention in August, when more than a thousand white supremacists held a large rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. The assorted racists and fascists, emboldened by President Donald Trump\u2019s election, weren\u2019t ashamed to show their faces, nor did they shy away from violence.\u00a0\nAt the end of the rally, James Alex Fields Jr., a member of the far-right extremist group Vanguard America, allegedly drove his car into a crowd of protesters, injuring 19 people and killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer.\u00a0\nEarlier that year in May, a right-wing extremist named Jeremy Christian allegedly stabbed two men to death aboard a train in Portland, Oregon, as they tried to stop Christian from harassing two teenage girls, one of whom was black and one of whom wore hijab.\u00a0\nAlso in May, a University of Maryland student named Sean Urbanski, who belonged to a bigoted Facebook group called \u201cAlt-Reich Nation,\u201d fatally stabbed Richard W. Collins III, an African-American student at Bowie State University. A prosecutor later stated that there was \u201clots of digital evidence\u201d proving that the murder was racially motivated.\u00a0\nIn March, a white supremacist from Maryland named James Harris Jackson, who frequented the alt-right website The Daily Stormer, traveled to New York to kill black men. Using a sword, he fatally stabbed a 66-year-old black man named Timothy Caughman in midtown Manhattan. He then turned himself into police.\u00a0\nAnd in December of last year, two young white supremacists on opposite sides of the country allegedly committed double homicides. In Virginia, 17-year-old Nicholas Giampa, who\u2019d grown enamored with a neo-Nazi group called Atomwaffen Division, killed\u00a0his girlfriend\u2019s parents after they had convinced their daughter to break up with Giampa because of his racist beliefs. In Aztec, New Mexico, 21-year-old William Atchison, who frequented white supremacist sites like The Daily Stormer, and who had grown obsessed with school shootings, killed two students at a local high school. Atchison took his own life, and Giampa attempted to and remains hospitalized in critical condition.\nThe increase in right-wing extremist murders helped make 2017 the fifth deadliest year on record for extremist violence since 1970, according to the ADL.\u00a0\nThe deadliest attack last year, however, wasn\u2019t committed by a white supremacist, but allegedly by Sayfullo Saipov, an Islamic extremist accused of driving a truck into a bike path lane in lower Manhattan, killing 8 people.\u00a0\nAlthough murders by extremists represent only a tiny fraction of the overall murder rate in the U.S. each year, \u201cbecause of their nature they can have outsized impact, affecting entire communities \u2014 or even an entire country \u2014 in ways many deaths may not,\u201d the ADL said in its report.\u00a0\nMoreover, the ADL noted,\u00a0the deaths described in its report represent \u201cthe tip of a pyramid of extremist violence and crime in the United States; for each person actually killed by an extremist, many more are wounded or injured in attempted murders and assaults.\u201d\u00a0\nGreenblatt, the ADL CEO,\u00a0wrote an article in The Atlantic on Tuesday imploring the public to take the threat of right-wing violence more seriously.\u00a0\n\u201cIn recent years, much of the public discussion and the federal government\u2019s focus have been on the violent threat posed by extremists inspired by ISIS, while less attention has been paid to the reality of right-wing violence,\u201d Greenblatt wrote. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that Islamic extremism is a significant threat, but we shouldn\u2019t ignore any forms of extremism \u2014 we must tackle them all.\u201d\u00a0\nOn Tuesday, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.)\u00a0said in a tweet that Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen \u201cfailed to mention\u201d the threat of domestic terror by white supremacists during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that day.\u00a0\nThe Trump administration last year revoked\u00a0federal funding for a program aimed at de-radicalizing neo-Nazis. And after the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville last August, the president defended the racists who gathered there, saying there were \u201cvery fine people on both sides\u201d of that day\u2019s demonstration.\u00a0\u00a0\nCORRECTION:\u00a0A previous version of this story indicated Giampa had killed himself. He attempted to, and is hospitalized and in critical condition.\nAmerica does not do a good job of tracking incidents of hate and bias.
