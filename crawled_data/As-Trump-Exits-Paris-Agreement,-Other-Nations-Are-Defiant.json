{"title": "As Trump Exits Paris Agreement, Other Nations Are Defiant", "content": "UNITED NATIONS \u2014 Leaders from around the world maintained a defiant front on Thursday after President Trump announced that he would withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement.\nPresident Emmanuel Macron of France, speaking in French before switching to English, said he believed Mr. Trump was making a mistake. He then extended an offer to Americans:\n\u201cTonight, I wish to tell the United States: France believes in you, the world believes in you. I know that you are a great nation. I know your history, our common history. To all scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs, responsible citizens who were disappointed by the decision of the president of the United States, I want to say that they will find in France a second home.\u201d\n\u201cI can assure you,\u201d Mr. Macron added, \u201cFrance will not give up the fight.\u201d He capped off his English remarks with a twist on Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign slogan: \u201cMake our planet great again.\u201d\nChina made it a point to say it would stay in the accord, while Mr. Macron and the leaders of Germany and Italy issued a joint statement expressing \u201cregret\u201d and rejecting Mr. Trump\u2019s assertion that he would renegotiate the deal.\n\u201cWe therefore reaffirm our strongest commitment to swiftly implement the Paris Agreement, including its climate finance goals, and we encourage all our partners to speed up their action to combat climate change,\u201d the statement said.\nMr. Trump, in a Rose Garden address, said he wanted better terms for the United States. \u201cWe are getting out,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we will start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that\u2019s fair. And if we can, that\u2019s great.\u201d\nBut Christiana Figueres, the former United Nations official who led the negotiations, said his remarks underscored a lack of understanding of how international agreements work. Under the accord, the United States cannot even submit its intention to withdraw until November 2019, after which the process would take a year.\n\u201cYou cannot renegotiate individually,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a multilateral agreement. No one country can unilaterally change the conditions.\u201d\nOther reactions were more blunt. The prime minister of Belgium, Charles Michel, called the American decision \u201ca brutal act.\u201d\nMary Robinson, former president of Ireland, said Mr. Trump\u2019s decision had turned the United States into \u201ca rogue state.\u201d Miguel Arias Ca\u00f1ete, the European Union\u2019s commissioner for climate, said Mr. Trump\u2019s decision had \u201cgalvanized us\u201d and promised that \u201cthis vacuum will be filled by new broad committed leadership.\u201d\nIn his address on Thursday, Mr. Trump also took aim at the Green Climate Fund, designed to help poor nations deal with the havoc of climate change, calling it a scheme to redistribute wealth. Ms. Figueres described the fund as a \u201cpolitical message\u201d of help from rich countries to poor countries that have done little to wreck the atmosphere. Countries decide how much they want to give, and former President Barack Obama, pledged last year to contribute $3 billion.\nThe secretary general of the United Nations, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, called Mr. Trump\u2019s move \u201ca major disappointment\u201d and while he said nothing specifically about a renegotiation, suggested that countries and businesses all over the world had already made advances based on the agreement.\n\u201cThe transformation envisaged in the Paris Agreement is already underway,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe Secretary-General remains confident that cities, states and businesses within the United States \u2014 along with other countries \u2014 will continue to demonstrate vision and leadership by working for the low-carbon, resilient economic growth that will create quality jobs and markets for 21st century prosperity.\u201d\nVictoria Tauli-Corpuz, the United Nations special envoy for indigenous people, said Mr. Trump\u2019s decision would punish those who were least to blame and the most vulnerable.\n\u201cWe are already seeing climate change destroy lives, livelihoods and entire communities,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cWhile indigenous peoples are often the first to feel these effects because of where we live, the entire planet will suffer as a result of history\u2019s largest emitter retreating on climate change.\u201d\nBefore the announcement, United Nations envoys from rich and poor countries alike said they were sticking to the agreement, with or without the United States. New diplomatic alliances were forming, with Europe, India and China pledging to uphold their end of the deal.\nPremier Li Keqiang of China, in Berlin for meetings with Chancellor Angela Merkel, said Thursday that his country remained committed to the fight against climate change and to participating in international efforts for a greener world.\nChina, the world\u2019s biggest emitter of carbon dioxide, stands to gain international credit for standing by the Paris Agreement, but it would not be able to fill the void on its own if the United States abandoned the treaty.\n\u201cChina will continue to uphold its commitments to the Paris climate agreement,\u201d Mr. Li said, confirming a position his country agreed to alongside the United States in 2014, in what proved to be a watershed moment for the passage of the landmark accord the following year.\nMs. Merkel, who welcomed the Chinese commitment as \u201cencouraging,\u201d has been a leader in the global push for climate action since she played a crucial international role in the passage of the world\u2019s first climate treaty, the Kyoto Protocol, in 1997.\nShe pointed to future cooperation between Brussels and Beijing, making clear the similar intention in Europe to move ahead with potential partners to fill any vacuum created by Washington\u2019s absence.\nMs. Merkel and India\u2019s leader, Narendra Modi, pledged their support for the climate accord during meetings in Berlin on Wednesday.\nAfter his meetings in Berlin, Mr. Li will head to Brussels for a summit meeting with European Union leaders. They are expected to announce a number of measures deepening joint cooperation on climate protection.\nIf the United States does withdraw, \u201cthe system of global climate governance won\u2019t totally collapse, but it will be shaken,\u201d said Zhang Haibin, a professor at Peking University who studies international environmental politics.\n\u201cThe international community may expect China to play a leading role,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in my view, China doesn\u2019t have the capacity to single-handedly play the role of global hero. Instead, we\u2019ll need to work closely with the European Union and the Basic countries,\u201d he said, referring to a negotiating bloc that includes Brazil, South Africa, India and China.\n\u201cCollective leadership will be more important,\u201d he said.\nThe one exception to the chorus of criticism on Thursday came from Poland, whose economy is heavily dependent on coal and whose conservative government has been a vocal critic of European climate policies.\nGrzegorz Tobiszowski, Poland\u2019s deputy minister of energy, commended President Trump\u2019s for his decision as he was signing an agreement on developing a new hard coal-fired power unit in Jaworzno, a city in southern Poland and one of the most polluted regions in Europe.\nYet even some of Washington\u2019s most reliable allies warned that the United States would find itself isolated on the international stage.\nPrime Minister Theresa May of Britain expressed her disappointment in a telephone call to Mr. Trump, according to a statement from her office. In the call, Ms. May reaffirmed her government\u2019s commitment to the agreement, according to the spokesman.\nAt United Nations headquarters in New York, Several Western diplomats said they could not fathom why the White House would join the tiny clique of nations \u2014 like Syria and Nicaragua \u2014 that had not signed the accord. The last time the United States\u2019 standing had fallen so low was during its invasion of Iraq, several said.\n\u201cHumanity is at a fork in the road,\u201d said Kai Sauer, the ambassador from Finland. \u201cOne hundred and ninety countries going on one path, and the United States, Syria, Nicaragua going on another? It seems a bit strange. This definitely also changes how we are looking at the United States.\u201d\nAlready, the United States is likely to miss the climate-related pledges that it made just last year because of policies set in motion by the Trump administration. So who can make up the difference? Perhaps the biggest surprise comes from India, which just a couple of years ago insisted that it needed to burn much more coal in order to lift its people out of poverty.\nSince then, India has sharply slowed the expansion of its coal-fired plants, and although coal use will most certainly rise, according to experts, the Indian government has said that in another 10 years, it may not need to build any more coal plants at all.\nNavroz K. Dubash, a climate change expert with the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi, said planned coal projects were struggling to obtain financing in India because of uncertainty over the regulatory environment, and most were unlikely to get off the ground.\nSolar and wind power prices have fallen sharply, making them far more competitive sources of energy for a poor country. And India has said it aimed to sell only electric cars by 2030.\nAfter the White House announcement, Lavanya Rajamani, a professor at the center and colleague of Mr. Dubash, called Mr. Trump\u2019s claims baffling: \u201cStating that the Paris Agreement hamstrings the U.S. while allowing India and China to increase their emissions is baffling,\u201d she said in an emailed statement. \u201cThe Agreement allows every country to choose its pledge tailored to its national circumstances.\u201d", "date": "June 1, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/01/world/europe/climate-paris-agreement-trump-china.html", "tags": "agreement china united states \u201d trump nations defiant climate exits paris"}
