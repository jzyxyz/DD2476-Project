{"title": "A Cabaret in Hungary Asks a Horrific Question: What if Jews Vanished?", "content": "BUDAPEST \u2014 What would happen if Jewish people suddenly disappeared?\nThat is the question asked by \u201cThe Chosen Ones,\u201d a new production by Golem Theater which had its premiere last month in Budapest.\nGolem, a Jewish theater company, describes the show as a political cabaret, with topical jokes and live music, that aims to lampoon hatred using dark humor. On opening night last month, a handful of players performed on a white revolving stage set against a shimmering curtain.\nAn early number proclaimed, \u201cNow the bank, the factory and the lawyer\u2019s office will close/Because the you-know-whos are gone, but we don\u2019t know where.\u201d\nThe evening unfolded in a succession of sketches and musical numbers presenting a cross-section of Hungarian society as they reacted to the news of the missing people: an orchestra suddenly lacking most of its players; a family eating a meal without the grandmother; a middle-class household discovering that the neighbors have vanished.\nDespite the absences, the players carried on. They sang and danced, swapping roles and guises.\nBut in this show, the audience of about 150 rarely laughed.\n\u201cI was very glad to see that one can feel sadness in a cabaret,\u201d said the production\u2019s director, Andras Borgula, who studied theater in Israel and founded Golem Theater in Budapest in 2005. \u201cOur intention wasn\u2019t to make a play about anti-Semitism, but about hatred in general, of which anti-Semitism is just one type,\u201d he added.\nHatred has been high on the agenda in Hungary since Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who began a third consecutive term in office this year, set out to establish an \u201cilliberal democracy\u201d in the country. Government-funded billboard campaigns, as well as television, radio and online advertisements, have presented threatening messages about migrants, the European Union and the Hungarian-born Jewish financier and philanthropist George Soros.\nThe prominence of hate speech in the country has caused concern internationally, and alarmed many in Hungary, a country which lost over half a million Jews in World War II and where anti-Semitism has been endemic throughout modern history.\nWhen billboards appeared across the country last summer, showing a smiling Mr. Soros with the line, \u201cDon\u2019t let Soros have the last laugh,\u201d anti-Semitic graffiti soon appeared on many of them. Andras Heisler, leader of the Federation of Hungarian Jewish Communities, addressed an open letter to Mr. Orban at the time: \u201cThis campaign, while not openly anti-Semitic, clearly has the potential to ignite uncontrolled emotions, including anti-Semitism,\u201d he wrote, calling for an end to \u201cthis bad dream.\u201d\nIn a phone interview this week, Mr. Heisler said that there was more public animosity in Hungary toward the Roma minority and refugees than toward Jews. But, he said, \u201cour historical experiences suggest that it is never good to have strong hatred in a country.\u201d\nAs the audience entered the venue for \u201cThe Chosen Ones,\u201d the director and some assistants greeted them from a stand, like agents conducting a survey. They sized up each person and categorized them in groups including \u201ccultural Jew,\u201d \u201cSoros Jew\u201d or \u201cself-hating Jew\u201d \u2014 labels taken from public speech and online forums in Hungary. Later, a young woman performed a musical litany of hate against everyone, across the whole political and social spectrum. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter why, doesn\u2019t matter who, everyone\u2019s a filthy something,\u201d she sang.\nPolitical cabaret is a popular genre in Hungary with a long tradition that survived through the country\u2019s Communist dictatorship. Some characters in \u201cThe Chosen Ones\u201d suggest real-life figures \u2014 one is \u201cthe prime minister,\u201d for example \u2014 others bring to mind archetypes, such as \u201cliberal protester.\u201d\nMr. Borgula said the anti-Semitic slurs heard onstage \u201cfly around in public life so much that we need to talk about them,\u201d adding, \u201cThis is therapy, we need to laugh at it.\u201d And plays that deal with current events are more popular with audiences than other productions in Golem Theater\u2019s repertoire, he said.\nIn 2016, state-run theaters, which make up the vast majority of playhouses in Hungary, sold 6.7 million tickets in a country of 9.8 million people, and the government also helps fund independent productions. The stage has long been a place of dissent, even under communism. Productions that criticize the government or raise taboo issues in society are common, despite the government\u2019s appointment of conservative directors to lead important theaters.\nGolem Theater is a Jewish company to the extent that it deals with topics from a Jewish perspective, Mr. Borgula said, adding that he was always open to working with artists from outside the community. For this production, he invited a diverse group of writers to create the script, including Borbala Szabo, a practicing Roman Catholic who describes herself as conservative but is critical of Mr. Orban\u2019s government.\nIn an interview, Ms. Szabo said that theater audiences in Hungary were sharply divided along political lines and tended to see plays that reinforced their worldview. \u201cThey come as if they were coming to Mass, knowing exactly what they want to hear,\u201d she said.\nMs. Szabo said she had friends, family and colleagues in both conservative and liberal circles, which helped her offer fresh perspectives.\n\u201cThis show attempts a kind of bubble-bursting,\u201d she said. \u201cIt shows the situation from several directions.\u201d One sketch features liberal activists self-importantly trying to find an adequate response to the disappearances. In a later scene, the prime minister is shown listening to ministers and advisers as they discuss how to find a new group that they can \u201clove on the surface but hate deep down.\u201d\nMs. Szabo said she hoped that liberals and conservatives would come and see the show.\n\u201cI think the way to defeat this type of regime, moving toward dictatorship, is to realize that in fact we are together as a country, and those above us manipulate us with this hatred,\u201d she said.\nAt the end of \u201cThe Chosen Ones\u201d there have been no consequences of the mysterious disappearance that is the show\u2019s central conceit. In real life, of course, there are still Jews in Hungary, but other elements of society have vanished since Mr. Orban took office: Universities have been closed and national newspapers which once had circulations of tens of thousands are gone.\nMr. Borgula said he wanted to highlight how \u201cwe wake up the next day and carry on with our lives.\u201d\n\u201cMy biggest fear, as a Jew and a Hungarian citizen,\u201d he added, \u201cis that this is what would really happen \u2014 namely, nothing.\u201d", "date": "Oct. 26, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/26/theater/hungary-the-chosen-ones-jews.html", "tags": "country theater hungary horrific cabaret jews \u201d golem asks vanished \u2014 jewish question"}
