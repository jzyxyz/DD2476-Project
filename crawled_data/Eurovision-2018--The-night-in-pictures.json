The man was arrested and held in custody by police. \nIf ever there's a night to wear an outrageously huge dress, this is it. Estonia's Elina Nechayeva was happy to oblige.\nLithuania's Ieva Zasimauskaite competed in Eurovision as part of the junior song contest when she was 14, returning aged 24.\nA very perky Benjamin Ingrosso sang for Sweden this year, but despite some solid scores he ended up in seventh place out of the 26 acts.\nThe Netherlands' Waylon was a crowd-pleaser with Outlaw in 'Em.\nClaudia Pascoal performed O Jardim for Portugal, but after the country's victorious performance last year, she came bottom of the leaderboard - with just 39 points. \nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.
