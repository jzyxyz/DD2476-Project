{"title": "European Companies Rushed to Invest in Iran. What Now?", "content": "FRANKFURT \u2014 European companies moved quickly to invest in Iran after it agreed in 2015 to mothball its nuclear weapons program in return for an end to economic sanctions.\nAutomakers like Daimler and PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn linked up with Iranian partners to sell vehicles. Siemens of Germany struck a deal to deliver locomotives. Total of France began a project to explore offshore natural gas.\nYet even before President Trump pulled out of the agreement with Iran, many companies had already tempered their expectations and limited their investment. Now their prospects look murkier as European leaders try to determine whether there is a path forward without the United States.\nOfficials in Europe want to protect its companies by finding ways to shield them from American sanctions while they continue doing business in Iran.\nThe United States, however, has not struck an optimistic tone. Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, has already said licenses that allow Boeing and Airbus, the American and European aircraft giants, to sell to Iran \u201cwill be revoked.\u201d\n\u201cThe objective is to put and maintain maximum sanctions on Iran,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.\nWith a population of about 82 million and substantial oil reserves, Iran represented a largely untouched market with the potential for fast growth, a rare opportunity for Western companies with global ambitions.\nWhile players like General Electric and Boeing lined up orders, many American companies, including oil giants like Chevron and Exxon Mobil, had to watch from a distance; even with the deal in place, they were still effectively blocked by sanctions imposed by the United States from working in Iran. European businesses did not have the same restrictions.\nFor Europe, Iran was a particularly promising example of the kind of fast-growing emerging country that helped lift the region out of a severe debt crisis in recent years. German companies, for instance, have thrived by selling factory machinery, power grid infrastructure and construction equipment that growing nations need to build modern economies.\nDespite its potential, however, Iran has largely been a disappointment for European investors. In a dysfunctional economy, many failed to gain traction in a huge bureaucracy rife with political power struggles.\nCompanies have also been stifled by a reluctance of foreign banks to provide financing, and fears \u2014 fully justified, as it turned out \u2014 that the nuclear d\u00e9tente would not last.\nAlthough exports from the European Union to Iran increased by about one-third last year to 10.8 billion euros, or about $12.8 billion, the country still ranked only 33rd among the bloc\u2019s trading partners, behind the likes of Kazakhstan and Serbia.\n\u201cGerman-Iranian economic relations are lagging their potential,\u201d Volker Treier, head of the exports department at the Association of German Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said in an email.\nAfter Mr. Trump\u2019s decision not to extend a moratorium on sanctions, Mr. Treier said, \u201cthe moderately positive development in business with Iran comes with a big question mark.\u201d\nIn the end, expectations may simply have been too high.\nAfter sanctions were lifted, Airbus of France signed a deal to remake Iran Air\u2019s aging fleet with more than 100 aircraft, including a dozen super jumbo A380s.\nSo far, Airbus has delivered just three jets, none of them super jumbos, a company spokesman said on Tuesday. Two of the three have been leased.\nIn 2016, Daimler signed an agreement with Iran Khodro, a vehicle maker based in Tehran, to distribute Fuso brand trucks. Demand has been limited, however, because of Iran\u2019s weak economy, Daimler spokesman Florian Martens said Tuesday.\nEven the Iranian oil industry was having trouble attracting foreign investors \u2014 the only significant deal the country signed after sanctions were lifted was with Total for an offshore natural gas development.\nWhether Total can stay in the deal is open to question. Although Europe may yet carve out protections for companies from the region, the company fears the imposition of so-called secondary sanctions by the United States against non-American businesses and individuals as part of the decision to pull out of the nuclear accord.\nPatrick Pouyann\u00e9, Total\u2019s chief executive, recently said that the company would argue that because it had signed its Iran deal before Mr. Trump\u2019s decision, Total should benefit from a \u201cgrandfather clause\u201d and would ask for a waiver from the United States to continue. Total also might turn its share over to its minority partner CNPC, a Chinese state-owned oil company.\nEuropean Union officials said on Tuesday that they were making plans to blunt the impact of Mr. Trump\u2019s withdrawal \u2014 presumably helping insulate companies like Total.\n\u201cWe are working on plans to protect the interests of European companies,\u201d Maja Kocijancic, a spokeswoman for the European Commission, told reporters on Tuesday.\nIt was unclear, however, what those measures might be.\nFrance, for example, hopes to engage in more detailed dialogue with the Trump administration to press for waivers for its companies. But it was too soon to say whether Mr. Trump would be swayed, according to two people with knowledge of the situation. It was also not immediately clear whether Mr. Trump would recognize the \u201cgrandfather clause\u201d arguments favored by Total, the people said.\nMr. Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of the deal with Iran may not automatically prompt governments to choke off trade.\nHaving ripped up an international deal, the president may have trouble recruiting allies and cutting off exports of Iranian oil, the country\u2019s most valuable product.\nIran\u2019s crude exports have risen to about 2.4 million barrels a day in recent months, after being around 1 million barrels a day in the months before sanctions were lifted.\n\u201cIt is going to be hard to get people on board,\u201d said Richard Nephew, a former State Department official who was the lead sanctions expert in the Iran negotiations under President Barack Obama and who successfully persuaded other customers of Iran to stop buying its oil in the years leading up to the eventual nuclear deal.\nMr. Nephew, now a senior research scholar at Columbia University\u2019s Center on Global Energy Policy, forecast that of Iran\u2019s major customers, Japan and South Korea would most likely cooperate on sanctions because they are worried about Washington\u2019s negotiations with North Korea.\nHe said European customers, however, would probably be slower to come around. And China and India, which in some months have been buying more than 1 million barrels a day from Iran, may continue to buy Iranian crude in the same quantities.\nAll told, the impact of renewed sanctions would be an estimated loss of 300,000 to 500,000 barrels a day of Iranian exports, Mr. Nephew said. That would be a significant amount, but much less than the 1.4 million barrels a day or so that Mr. Obama\u2019s sanctions achieved.\nIn the meantime, Iran is running its oil industry at full tilt, analysts say. \u201cIt is obvious that they are anticipating potential new sanctions and running full speed before it happens,\u201d said Antoine Rostand, president of Kayrros, a Paris-based market research firm.\nBut the sanctions would nonetheless create major complications. Iran has quickly pumped up oil production in existing fields, but these will eventually become tapped out. It won\u2019t be able to bring new fields online without partners and capital.\nStill, giant oil corporations have not given up on Iran.\n\u201cWe continue to be interested in exploring the role Shell can play in developing Iran\u2019s energy potential within the boundaries of applicable laws,\u201d Royal Dutch Shell said in an email on Tuesday.\nThe same principle applies to other investors, provided they are big enough \u2014 and wealthy enough \u2014 to handle the risk, said Andreas Schweitzer, managing director of Arjan Capital, a firm in London that advises companies on investing in Iran.\n\u201cThose who want this 80-million-person market and have a long-term strategy,\u201d he said, \u201cwill go there with or without Mr. Trump.\u201d", "date": "May 9, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/09/business/iran-nuclear-trump-business-europe.html", "tags": "iran european rushed sanctions companies invest \u201d deal"}
