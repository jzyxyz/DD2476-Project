{"title": "Paul Ryan's Whole Career Was About Sticking It To The Poor And Elderly", "content": "House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has spent the better part of his political career trying to shred America\u2019s social safety net, so that literally tens of millions of Americans would lose supports they use to get food, health care and pay their most basic bills.\nRyan, who announced Wednesday that he won\u2019t seek re-election this fall, mostly hasn\u2019t succeeded in this effort. But he has left an indelible impact on the Republican Party\u2019s identity.\nAs an architect of the GOP\u2019s budget blueprints, its vice presidential nominee in 2012 and the leader of the House\u2019s majority caucus since 2015, Ryan has laid out a detailed, sweeping agenda of lower taxes and government spending. If ever fully enacted,\u00a0it would arguably amount\u00a0to the most radical domestic policy overhaul\u00a0since the mid-1960s.\nRyan\u2019s one big victory was on taxes \u2015 he was instrumental in writing and passing the bill that President Donald Trump signed late last year. It will dramatically reduce what the wealthiest Americans pay, realizing one of Ryan\u2019s long-held dreams.\nBut so far, at least, Republicans haven\u2019t privatized Medicare, repealed the Affordable Care Act, or transformed programs like food stamps into smaller, state-run initiatives. And while most Republicans still endorse these proposals, the public does not. \nUltimately, that could be Ryan\u2019s true legacy: Tethering his party to an extreme, deeply conservative agenda that the public rejects, starting with the November midterm elections.\nRyan first gained national attention in 2010 at a televised, bipartisan meeting on the effort to pass then-President Barack Obama\u2019s health care reform bill. He\u2019d been a representative for about a decade then. He distinguished himself among GOP attendees at the session with Obama for his knowledge of policy intricacy and ability to articulate a deeply conservative vision of government that would spend and do much less. \nThe ensuing midterms gave Republicans control of the House and gave Ryan, incoming chairman of the budget committee, a chance to flesh out that agenda. The resulting proposal, known as the \u201cPath to Prosperity,\u201d called for giving states more flexibility to administer programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, typically referred to as food stamps. \nRyan\u2019s ideas for those programs built on the concept of \u201cwelfare reform\u201d legislation Congress passed in 1996, which put a lid on federal funding and delegated more authority to states \u2015 ultimately resulting in far fewer eligible Americans receiving benefits. Ryan had worked on Capitol Hill as a staffer at the time. \nPerhaps the most striking element of Ryan\u2019s proposal was its call to reinvent Medicare, the wildly popular program for the elderly that politicians attack at their own peril.\nRyan promised not to alter the program for people currently on it or within 10 years of eligibility. But he proposed to treat future beneficiaries differently, providing them with a voucher for private insurance rather than a guarantee of benefits. Over time, the voucher would lose value relative to health care costs, experts predicted, so that seniors would be increasingly responsible for their own medical bills.\nAfter Ryan released a slightly revised version of the budget one year later, Robert Greenstein, president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, called it \u201ca remarkable document \u2014 one that, for most of the past half-century, would have been outside the bounds of mainstream discussion due to its extreme nature.\u201d \nIf enacted, Greenstein warned, it would produce \u201cthe largest redistribution of income from the bottom to the top in modern U.S. history,\u201d\nRyan insisted such redistribution would ultimately leave the poor better off, in part by improving the economy as a whole. But he also justified his agenda in moral terms,\u00a0speaking frequently about\u00a0\u201cmakers\u201d (i.e., people who work and earn good incomes) and \u201ctakers\u201d (i.e., lazy people who subsist on government assistance).\nRyan has cited Ayn Rand, the libertarian philosopher, as a major influence. At a 2005 conference, audio of which the Atlantic eventually obtained, he said, \u201cIt is the morality of what is occurring right now, and how it offends the morality of individuals working toward their own free will to produce, to achieve, to succeed, that is under attack, and it is that what I think Ayn Rand would be commenting on.\u201d\nAfter the 2012 presidential election, Ryan made a concerted effort to put the makers-and-takers rhetoric behind. He traveled the country visiting private-sector charities that rehabilitated drug addicts and helped them find jobs.\nBut his agenda never really changed.\nThe poverty tour resulted in a book and a new policy pitch that simply applied the \u201cwelfare reform\u201d playbook to all federal poverty programs, albeit with a greater emphasis on case management for poor people.\u00a0\nAnd just last year,\u00a0during a public discussion of Medicaid with National Review editor Rich Lowry, he remarked that \u201cwe\u2019ve been dreaming\u201d about cuts to such social programs \u201csince you and I were drinking out of a keg.\u201d\u00a0\nRyan was hardly the first Republican to call for a sweeping rollback of New Deal and Great Society programs. Ryan\u2019s agenda was in many ways a direct descendant of the plans that Newt Gingrich, the Georgia Republican, proposed and tried to enact when he became House Speaker in 1995.\nBut quite unlike Gingrich, who was famous for his rhetorical and stylistic intemperance, Ryan cultivated an image as a calm, serious thinker \u2015 and as a candid one, too. Over and over again Ryan warned of a \u201cdebt crisis\u201d and, sometimes, blamed previous GOP congressional leaders for their complicity in making deficits bigger during the presidency of George W. Bush. \nRyan frequently presented his plans as an attempt to restore fiscal order and gained a reputation as a serious fiscal hawk. In 2011, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget gave Ryan one of its \u201cfiscy\u201d awards.\nThat recognition did not age well. Ryan turned out to be as committed to fiscal responsibility as his Republican predecessors were \u2015 which is to say, he wasn\u2019t very committed at all, as a handful of critics had long warned. (One of them was New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, who in 2010 called Ryan a \u201cflimflam man.\u201d) Although he didn\u2019t like to advertise it, he too had voted for those deficit-busting proposals of the Bush era. \nAnd once Ryan was in charge of writing GOP budgets, starting in 2011, he relied heavily on generous assumptions about economic growth and unspecified spending cuts that nobody seriously believed Congress would make. \nWhen Trump became president, Ryan finally had the opportunity he\u2019d coveted for so long \u2015 a chance to use his blueprint and transform public policy. On taxes he got his way, more or less. Although the final bill did not enact many of the changes he desired, it gave enormous new breaks to the very wealthiest Americans, while handing only a pittance to the middle class. \nThe new law\u2019s corporate tax cut is permanent, while the individual tax cuts aren\u2019t \u2015 which means that the majority of Americans would actually end up paying more, although Republicans have made clear their hopes that lawmakers will eventually make those cuts permanent, as well.\nThe tax cuts are likely to add $1.5 trillion to the deficit, according to the Congressional Budget Office. If all the reductions become permanent, the impact will be even larger.\nRyan\u2019s assault on government programs fared rather differently. \nImmediately after Trump\u2019s election, Ryan joined with his Senate counterpart, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), to vow immediate action on repealing the Affordable Care Act. But although wiping out \u201cObamacare\u201d had become the GOP\u2019s defining cause, and one Trump had identified as his top priority, multiple efforts to pass sweeping repeal bills failed.\nThe bill shepherded through the House couldn\u2019t get Senate approval, the Senate couldn\u2019t come together on its own measure, and in the end Republicans had to settle on repeal of the law\u2019s individual mandate, the financial penalty for people who don\u2019t have coverage. That\u2019s a meaningful change to the law, and one that conservatives celebrated, but it leaves most of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s edifice in place.\nThe effort didn\u2019t fail by much. A key Senate bill fell just one vote short when Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) issued a dramatic, unexpected thumbs down on the floor. But by then the measure was already deeply unpopular and it was no surprise why. \nFor all of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s shortcomings and despite the public\u2019s decidedly mixed feelings about it, people overwhelmingly supported the new protections for pre-existing conditions and the expansion of insurance \u2015 through both Medicaid and subsidized private coverage \u2015 that had put medical care within reach for millions.\nMost Republicans haven\u2019t given up on repeal, or the rest of Ryan\u2019s agenda for that matter. If Republicans continue to hold governing majorities in Congress, they will have yet another opportunity to enact at least some of his proposals, carrying on Ryan\u2019s crusade while he cheers on from the sidelines.\nBut especially if Republicans lose a house of Congress, and maybe even if they don\u2019t, the programs that Ryan has targeted may be safe \u2015 at least for now. His ideas won\u2019t go away. But their popularity, or lack thereof, remains clear.", "date": "\n04/11/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/paul-ryan-social-safety-net-assault_n_5ace41e7e4b0648767761edf", "tags": "elderly ryan poor paul \u201d one \u2015 career republicans programs agenda sticking whole care"}
