{"title": "Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago Resort Files Request To Hire Foreign Workers \u2014 Again", "content": "Just over a year after President\u00a0Donald Trump signed his\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBuy American and Hire American\u201d\u00a0executive order, his Mar-a-Lago golf resort in Florida has filed for permission to hire 61 foreign workers.\nTrump\u2019s Palm Beach business filed requests with the U.S. Labor Department for additional visas for foreign servers and cooks, according to records submitted\u00a0Thursday and Friday. The employees would work October through the following May. Servers would earn $12.68 an hour and cooks $13.31 an hour.\nSince late 2015, Mar-a-Lago has filed 10 separate requests for multiple temporary work visas for foreign employees.\nThe New York Times has reported that since 2010, only 17 of 300 American applicants were hired to work at the resort that Trump now calls the \u201cWinter White House\u201d or the \u201cSouthern White House.\u201d Since 2010, Mar-a-Lago has obtained a total of 500 H-2B visas for seasonal foreign workers, according to\u00a0The New Yorker.\nThe Trump Organization hired at least 1,260 foreign workers\u00a0from 2001 to 2016, according to a CNN analysis.\u00a0Trump appears to prefer foreign workers at his resorts who are female, young, attractive and with Romanian or South African accents that convey an \u201cexotic appeal,\u201d\u00a0former workers told the network.\nIn order to obtain the\u00a0H-2B visas required for non-agricultural workers, employers must prove that there are not enough Americans willing to do the work\u00a0\u2014 which Trump has insisted is the case.\nBut in a similar situation last year, Mar-a-Lago apparently didn\u2019t make much of an effort to find American workers. The Washington Post reported that the resort only placed two hard-to-find classified ads in tiny type for waiters, and provided no phone number or email information. Workers could\u00a0apply only by fax or mail. The ads were posted a week after\u00a0Mar-a-Lago\u00a0asked the Labor Department\u00a0for permission to hire 70 foreign workers, which was granted\u00a0last November.\nNonprofit placement agency CareerSource Palm Beach County told The Palm Beach Post that many Americans were eager to work at Mar-a-Lago,\u00a0and that the agency had a database last November of\u00a05,136 qualified candidates\u00a0for \u201cvarious hospitality positions.\u201d\nDespite Trump railing about U.S. immigration policy \u2015 for both the undocumented and documented \u2015 his administration made an extra 15,000 H-2B visas available\u00a0for businesses in May.\nMar-a-Lago was applying for foreign worker visas\u00a0about the same time the president launched\u00a0\u201cMade in America Week\u201d\u00a0at the White House a year ago.\u00a0\u00a0\nTrump said then:\u00a0\u201cWe believe jobs must be offered to American workers first. Does that make sense?\u201d", "date": "\n07/07/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trumps-mar-a-lago-applies-to-hire-61-foreign-workers_n_5b3fefa1e4b07b827cc07826", "tags": "american files work mar-a-lago hire \u201d trump visas donald year workers request resort \u2014 foreign"}
