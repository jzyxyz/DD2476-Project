{"title": "Conservative Men Are Obsessed With Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez- Science Tells Us Why-", "content": "Conservatives\u2019 bizarre, escalating obsession with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) reached a new level this week when The Daily Caller published fake revenge porn of the new congresswoman.\n\u201cHere\u2019s The Photo Some People Described As A Nude Selfie Of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,\u201d the Caller\u2019s original headline read, before it was changed and the site posted a \u201cwe regret the error\u201d message on Twitter. For the record, the photo is not of Ocasio-Cortez, despite what \u201csome people\u201d have said.\nSince Ocasio-Cortez, a 29-year-old working-class democratic socialist, unexpectedly toppled powerful white male incumbent Joe Crowley in a June primary, she\u2019s become an object of fixation among Republicans, especially Republican men. Conservative writer Ed Scarry posted a photo of her backside on Twitter, questioning whether her black suit was befitting of a \u201cgirl who struggles.\u201d Right-wing media discovered that she \u2015 like a lot of people named \u201cAlexander,\u201d \u201cAlexandra\u201d or some variant thereof \u2015 went by the nickname \u201cSandy\u201d in high school. A self-proclaimed \u201cproud Christian Dad\u201d on Twitter circulated a video of her dancing in a T-shirt in college as if it would be a career-damaging revelation. A Republican strategist referred to her as \u201cthe little girl\u201d on Fox News, which runs segments about her constantly.\nThe obvious explanation is that men have literally never seen a woman in her 20s in the halls of Congress before. She\u2019s attractive, telegenic and good at social media. She dances outside her Cannon House office. Conservative men are confused at being drawn to this bright rising star in the Democratic Party while loathing everything she stands for. \nBut that doesn\u2019t fully explain the fervor with which conservatives hang on her every word, waiting for her to slip, and dig through her past for any feeble sign that she isn\u2019t who she says she is. There\u2019s an existential, panicked tinge to the behavior here \u2015 what you might call \u201cAOC Derangement Syndrome.\u201d Indeed, some experts say conservative men are obsessed with Ocasio-Cortez because they\u2019re threatened by her.\nConservatives tend to respond to fear more strongly than liberals do, according to Bobby Azarian, a neuroscientist whose expertise in anxiety has led him to examine political behaviors. His research has found that the brains of conservative people are likely to display the same attention biases as the brains of people with anxiety. \n\u201cThe one main cognitive difference is that conservatives are more sensitive to threat,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir fears are sometimes exaggerated. I think they fear her.\u201d \nOcasio-Cortez\u2019s power is a direct threat to conservatives because her very existence in Congress as a young, Latina, working-class woman threatens to upend the social order that has kept white men in the ruling class for centuries. (Eighty-eight percent of House Republicans are white men, most are over the age of 50, and the party\u2019s voters are majority white and male.) On top of that, she is using her position and platform to directly challenge that order \u2015 to attempt to get money out of politics, raise taxes on the super-rich and level the playing field.\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t just challenge the patriarchy, she\u2019s challenging the race, class, and gender hierarchies all at once, as well as the capitalist system that requires member of Congress be wealthy before they get there,\u201d said Caroline Heldman, a gender and politics professor at Occidental College. \u201cThat\u2019s remarkably threatening.\u201d\nIn a way, Ocasio-Cortez is the most formidable opponent to President Donald Trump the Democratic Party has put forth yet. She has even more of a knack for social media than America\u2019s first Twitter president; she\u2019s anti-establishment like he is; she breaks all the rules of how a politician is supposed to behave; and she has an undeniably strong emotional appeal. \n\u201cShe\u2019s engaging attention and emotion in people at this visceral level,\u201d Azarian said. \u201cShe has some combination of a lot of features that really seems to give her this ability to go viral. And I think that\u2019s what Trump had.\u201d \u00a0\nThat\u2019s why conservatives want and need to undercut her influence. And the most time-tested way to undermine a woman\u2019s power is to sexualize her, to make her an object instead of an agent. A 2013 study by the Women\u2019s Media Center found that merely discussing a female candidate\u2019s appearance has a negative effect on her support from voters. \u00a0\n\u201cThe moment at which you turn someone into a sex object, you put yourself in a position of authority over them, which is why sexual harassment is classified as being a form of gender discrimination in the workplace,\u201d Heldman said. \u201cThey are the object who exists for you, and you are validating their worth.\u201d \nOr, as former Hillary Clinton campaign staffer Jess McIntosh put it: \u201cDefining a woman\u2019s value by whether or not men want to have sex with her is the oldest trick in the patriarchy. Either way, she\u2019s diminished.\u201d \nThe problem for these men is that Ocasio-Cortez doesn\u2019t seem interested in what they think of her. She doesn\u2019t seek attention for anything other than her policy ideas and ambition, even though Americans still seem to dislike\u00a0power-seeking women. The typical strategies men use to devalue women \u2015 \u201csexualizing, dismissing, controlling, teasing, criticizing, interrupting, psychopathologizing, humiliating, abusing,\u201d according to one psychologist\u00a0\u2015 seem to bounce right off her. \n\u201cAlexandria presents a challenge, because conservative men or men in general who are encouraged to objectify women are attracted to her, but she\u2019s also \u2018unmanageable\u2019 in that she doesn\u2019t exist for them,\u201d Heldman said. \u201cShe is a woman who not only has now formal power, but a lot of informal power, in that she doesn\u2019t give a damn what they think of her. I think it\u2019s a disconcerting place for men who may be used to attractive women seeking their validation.\u201d \nThat kind of inability to deal with a woman like Ocasio-Cortez is, in many ways, emblematic of the broader crisis facing the Republican Party, which is moving backward in terms of gender diversity in Congress even as Democrats add more women and people of color to their ranks each year. In the 1990s, women were equally distributed across both parties in Congress; today, there are 13 Republican women and 89 Democratic women. Republicans have only ever had one black woman in the House of Representatives, Mia Love of Utah, and she just lost her bid for re-election. \nThat\u2019s a self-reinforcing dynamic, said Laurel Elder, politics professor and head of the gender studies program at Hartwick College.\n\u201cThe way they\u2019ve talked about some of the new women in the 116th Congress, and the way they\u2019ve tried to belittle or mock [Ocasio-Cortez], this just makes women feel like, \u2018Oh, this party is not welcoming of women,\u2019\u201d Elder said. \u201c\u2018This is not a place where I\u2019d feel comfortable throwing my hat in the ring.\u2019 Now the dynamic has a life of its own.\u201d \nThe obsessive focus on Ocasio-Cortez and her past may not just discourage Republican women from seeking office \u2015 it could intimidate any woman who grew up in the age of social media and is interested in politics but doesn\u2019t want to see her adolescent life splashed all over the front pages.\nFor now, though, Ocasio-Cortez has proven able to parry the attacks, simply by holding up a mirror to the men who are convulsing in anxiety as she rises to influence.
