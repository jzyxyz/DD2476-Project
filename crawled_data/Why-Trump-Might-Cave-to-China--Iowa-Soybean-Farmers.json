{"title": "Why Trump Might Cave to China: Iowa Soybean Farmers", "content": "For all his bluster about trade wars, President Trump seems willing to push China only so far: Witness the deal on Thursday to grant Chinese telecom giant ZTE a reprieve from harsh American penalties. The reason is likely to lead straight to Iowa soybean and corn farmers like Benjamin Schmidt.\nMr. Schmidt\u2019s forebears have farmed the same land outside Iowa City for nearly 150 years. He and his father together till about 2,500 acres of the fertile prairie that stretches from Ohio through Nebraska. When I reached him last week, he was on his tractor, spreading fertilizer on this year\u2019s corn crop.\nApart from the weather, hardly any issue looms larger for farmers than the prospect of retaliatory tariffs against American agriculture products. China has threatened a 25 percent tariff on soybeans and has already sharply curtailed purchases from the United States. This week Mexico imposed a 20 percent tariff on pork. The European Union and Canada have said they, too, will slap tariffs on a variety of American agricultural products.\n\u201cChina is our most important export market for soybeans,\u201d Mr. Schmidt said. \u201cWhen your most important customer hits you with tariffs, there are going to be serious ramifications. My first reaction was this is going to hit us pretty hard.\u201d\nGrant Kimberley, who with his father farms 4,000 acres near Maxwell, Iowa, and is director of market development for the Iowa Soybean Association, was even more emphatic: \u201cWe want to sell to China, Mexico, whoever. We should be part of the solution, which is bringing down the trade imbalance.\u201d\nAmerican farmers may be dwindling in absolute numbers, but they wield outsize influence in the raging war between protectionists and free traders in the Trump White House. That\u2019s because of both the importance of their occupation to the balance of trade \u2014 United States agricultural exports have averaged nearly $140 billion a year since 2010 \u2014 and their geographical concentration in states that were critical to Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 electoral majority.\nMuch of the farm belt is solidly Republican. But Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota are presidential battlegrounds, where even a small defection of farmers could doom Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election prospects.\nLater this year, hotly contested Senate races in a swath of farm states \u2014 Minnesota, Wisconsin, Missouri, Indiana and North Dakota \u2014 will determine whether Republicans can maintain their majority in the Senate.\nMr. Schmidt is one of those voters up for grabs. He voted for Mr. Trump and leans Republican. \u201cBut I\u2019m more of an independent,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m no Trumpeter. I\u2019m still pondering whether he\u2019s the right person for the job.\u201d\nHe pointed out that Mr. Trump recently wrote on Twitter that China would be buying \u201cmassive amounts\u201d of United States agricultural products, \u201cone of the best things to happen to our farmers in many years,\u201d only to renew the tariff threat days later.\n\u201cHe says one thing and then two days later something else happens,\u201d Mr. Schmidt said. \u201cIt\u2019s like North Korea. It\u2019s on, then it\u2019s off, then it\u2019s on again.\u201d\nMr. Schmidt and other Iowa farmers are turning for help to one of their senators, Charles Grassley, a Republican who they note is himself a farmer.\nSteffen Schmidt, professor of political science at Iowa State University in Ames, credited Mr. Grassley with being \u201cthe single most powerful senator\u201d right now, thanks to his seniority and chairmanship of the powerful Judiciary Committee, which is investigating Russian interference in Mr. Trump\u2019s election.\nWhen I spoke to Mr. Grassley this week, he said he\u2019d met with the president three times \u2014 and his advisers at least a dozen times \u2014 over the last year to discuss trade issues. \u201cI know Trump heard what we said, but I don\u2019t know what impact it made on him,\u201d Mr. Grassley said. \u201cBecause today there are going to be tariffs, and tomorrow there aren\u2019t. I sincerely believe him when the president says he likes farmers. But I don\u2019t feel he understands the economics of agriculture the way he understands real estate.\u201d\n\u201cWhenever there\u2019s tariff retaliation agriculture is the first thing hit,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe just hope the president knows what he\u2019s doing, and we hope he\u2019s negotiating in good faith to get a better deal for us. If he doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s going to be catastrophic for agriculture.\u201d\nMr. Grassley said he didn\u2019t want to make any predictions about the midterm or presidential elections, but said, \u201cIf this turns out to be catastrophic, there\u2019s obviously going to be real disappointment\u201d among voters in farm states.\nMr. Trump clearly recognizes the high stakes. In a recent White House meeting with lawmakers and governors from a number of farm states, he pledged that the federal government would support agricultural prices should retaliatory tariffs cause the price of soybeans, corn and other major exports to fall.\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t specific, but he assured us Sonny Perdue has a plan,\u201d Mr. Grassley said, referring to the secretary of agriculture. \u201cOur response was unanimous. I\u2019m paraphrasing, but the message was, we don\u2019t want help from the Treasury. We want free and open markets.\u201d\nMr. Kimberley had a similar reaction. And he asked a question that still resonates in Iowa: \u201cWho\u2019s going to pay for this? Soybean exports alone account for $14 billion a year. You\u2019re talking billions of dollars.\u201d\nEveryone I spoke to in Iowa agreed that China engages in a range of unfair trade practices that need to be addressed. But no one said a tariff war is the way to do it. \u201cChina is projected to be one of the fastest growing export markets over the next decade, and we want to be part of that growth,\u201d Mr. Kimberley said.\nWhile some farmers \u201cwant to hold China\u2019s feet to the fire,\u201d he said, the Trump administration may be underestimating the ties that have developed in recent decades between American farmers and Chinese leaders.\nMr. Kimberley told me he\u2019s visited China on average more than once a year over the last decade to promote soybeans. Iowa and China\u2019s Hebei Province have been official sister states since 1985. In 2012, Xi Jinping, then vice president and now president of China, visited Mr. Kimberley\u2019s family farm, where Mr. Kimberley greeted him in Mandarin. It\u2019s not a coincidence that the United States ambassador in Beijing is Iowa\u2019s former governor Terry Branstad.\nSo far, commodity markets have largely shrugged off threats of agriculture tariffs, presumably because traders don\u2019t believe they\u2019ll go into effect. \u201cWhen I run into my neighbors at the feed store, they\u2019re saying they don\u2019t think there will be a trade war,\u201d Professor Schmidt said. \u201cThey say that Trump\u2019s bluffing; he\u2019s a deal maker. I hope they\u2019re right.\u201d\nThis week\u2019s ZTE deal is an example of the Trump administration making concessions to China \u2014 an encouraging sign for farmers like Mr. Schmidt.\nAfter ZTE violated American sanctions on Iran, the United States in April threatened to bar it from doing business in the country. The Chinese government was furious that the Trump administration was essentially putting a major company out of business.\n[Catch up on what ZTE is and why President Trump wants to help it.]\nOn Thursday, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the United States and China had reached an agreement in which ZTE would pay a $1 billion fine and allow American officials into the company to monitor its compliance with sanctions.\nMr. Ross said the ZTE deal wasn\u2019t connected to broader trade issues, but Mr. Kimberley hopes the Trump administration will also compromise on tariffs. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be posturing on both sides, but there\u2019s a lot more to be gained by meeting in the middle and finding a solution,\u201d he said. This week, for example, China offered to buy nearly $70 billion of American goods, including farm exports, if the United States drops its tariff threat.\nMr. Schmidt said he, too, is optimistic a tariff war can be averted. \u201cI can\u2019t say Trump has gone about this the way I would,\u201d he said from his tractor. \u201cAs a farmer, I try to stay positive.\u201d", "date": "June 7, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/07/business/trump-trade-china-iowa-soybeans.html", "tags": "farmers china \u201c iowa might states soybean trump schmidt cave said"}
