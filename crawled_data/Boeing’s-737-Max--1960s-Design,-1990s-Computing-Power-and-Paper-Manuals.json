{"title": "Boeing\u2019s 737 Max: 1960s Design, 1990s Computing Power and Paper Manuals", "content": "Pilots start some new Boeing planes by turning a knob and flipping two switches.\nThe Boeing 737 Max, the newest passenger jet on the market, works differently. Pilots follow roughly the same seven steps used on the first 737 nearly 52 years ago: Shut off the cabin\u2019s air-conditioning, redirect the air flow, switch on the engine, start the flow of fuel, revert the air flow, turn back on the air conditioning, and turn on a generator.\nThe 737 Max is a legacy of its past, built on decades-old systems, many that date back to the original version. The strategy, to keep updating the plane rather than starting from scratch, offered competitive advantages. Pilots were comfortable flying it, while airlines didn\u2019t have to invest in costly new training for their pilots and mechanics. For Boeing, it was also faster and cheaper to redesign and recertify than starting anew.\nBut the strategy has now left the company in crisis, following two deadly crashes in less than five months. The Max stretched the 737 design, creating a patchwork plane that left pilots without some safety features that could be important in a crisis \u2014 ones that have been offered for years on other planes. It is the only modern Boeing jet without an electronic alert system that explains what is malfunctioning and how to resolve it. Instead pilots have to check a manual.\n[Update: Claims of shoddy production draw scrutiny to a second Boeing jet.]\nThe Max also required makeshift solutions to keep the plane flying like its ancestors, workarounds that may have compromised safety. While the findings aren\u2019t final, investigators suspect that one workaround, an anti-stall system designed to compensate for the larger engines, was central to the crash last month in Ethiopia and an earlier one in Indonesia.\nThe Max \u201cain\u2019t your father\u2019s Buick,\u201d said Dennis Tajer, a spokesman for the American Airlines pilots\u2019 union who has flown the 737 for a decade. He added that \u201cit\u2019s not lost on us that the foundation of this aircraft is from the \u201960s.\u201d\n[Boeing was \u201cgo, go, go\u201d to beat Airbus with the 737 Max.]\nThe Max, Boeing\u2019s best-selling model, with more than 5,000 orders, is suddenly a reputational hazard. It could be weeks or months before regulators around the world lift their ban on the plane, after Boeing\u2019s expected software fix was delayed. Southwest Airlines and American Airlines have canceled some flights through May because of the Max grounding.\nThe company has slowed production of the plane, putting pressure on its profits, and some buyers are reconsidering their orders. Shares of the company fell over 4 percent on Monday, and are down 11 percent since the Ethiopia crash.\n\u201cIt was state of the art at the time, but that was 50 years ago,\u201d said Rick Ludtke, a former Boeing engineer who helped design the Max\u2019s cockpit. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good airplane for the current environment.\u201d\nThe 737 has long been a reliable aircraft, flying for decades with relatively few issues. Gordon Johndroe, a Boeing spokesman, defended the development of the Max, saying that airlines wanted an updated 737 over a new single-aisle plane and that pilots were involved in its design.\n\u201cListening to pilots is an important aspect of our work. Their experienced input is front-and-center in our mind when we develop airplanes,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWe share a common priority \u2014 safety \u2014 and we listen carefully to their feedback.\u201d He added that American regulators approved the plane under the same standards they used with previous aircraft.\n[Boeing announced that it was going to cut production of the 737 Max.]\nBoeing\u2019s chief executive, Dennis Muilenburg, said in a statement on Friday that the crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia appeared to have been caused by the Max\u2019s new anti-stall system. \u201cWe have the responsibility to eliminate this risk, and we know how to do it,\u201d he said.\nAt a factory near Seattle on Jan. 17, 1967, flight attendants christened the first Boeing 737, smashing champagne bottles over its wing. Boeing pitched the plane as a smaller alternative to its larger jets, earning it the nickname the \u201cBaby Boeing.\u201d\nEarly on, sales lagged Boeing\u2019s biggest competitor, McDonnell Douglas. In 1972, Boeing had delivered just 14 of the jets, and it considered selling the program to a Japanese manufacturer, said Peter Morton, the 737 marketing manager in the early 1970s. \u201cWe had to decide if we were going to end it, or invest in it,\u201d Mr. Morton said.\nUltimately, Boeing invested. The 737 eventually began to sell, bolstered by airline deregulation in 1978. Six years later, Boeing updated the 737 with its \u201cclassic\u201d series, followed by the \u201cnext generation\u201d in 1997, and the Max in 2017. Now nearly one in every three domestic flights in the United States is on a 737, more than any other line of aircraft.\nEach of the three redesigns came with a new engine, updates to the cabin and other changes. But Boeing avoided overhauling the jet in order to appease airlines, according to current and former Boeing executives, pilots and engineers, some of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the open investigations. Airlines wanted new 737s to match their predecessors so pilots could skip expensive training in flight simulators and easily transition to new jets.\nBoeing\u2019s strategy worked. The Federal Aviation Administration never required simulator training for pilots switching from one 737 to the next.\n\u201cAirlines don\u2019t want Boeing to give them a fancy new product if it requires them to retrain their pilots,\u201d said Matthew Menza, a former 737 Max test pilot for Boeing. \u201cSo you iterate off a design that\u2019s 50 years old. The old adage is: If it\u2019s not broke, don\u2019t fix it.\u201d\nIt did require engineering ingenuity, to ensure a decades-old jet handled mostly the same. In doing so, some of the jet\u2019s one-time selling points became challenges.\nFor instance, in the early years of the 737, jet travel was rapidly expanding across the world. The plane\u2019s low-slung frame was a benefit for airlines and airports in developing countries. Workers there could load bags by hand without a conveyor belt and maintain the engines without a lift, Mr. Morton said. In the decades that followed, the low frame repeatedly complicated efforts to fit bigger engines under the wing.\nBy 2011, Boeing executives were starting to question whether the 737 design had run its course. The company wanted to create an entirely new single-aisle jet. Then Boeing\u2019s rival Airbus added a new fuel-efficient engine to its line of single-aisle planes, the A320, and Boeing quickly decided to update the jet again.\n\u201cWe all rolled our eyes. The idea that, \u2018Here we go. The 737 again,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Ludtke, the former 737 Max cockpit designer who spent 19 years at Boeing.\n\u201cNobody was quite perhaps willing to say it was unsafe, but we really felt like the limits were being bumped up against,\u201d he added.\nSome engineers were frustrated they would have to again spend years updating the same jet, taking care to limit any changes, instead of starting fresh and incorporating significant technological advances, the current and former engineers and pilots said. The Max still has roughly the original layout of the cockpit and the hydraulic system of cables and pulleys to control the plane, which aren\u2019t used in modern designs. The flight-control computers have roughly the processing power of 1990s home computers. A Boeing spokesman said the aircraft was designed with an appropriate level of technology to ensure safety.\nWhen engineers did make changes, it sometimes created knock-on effects for how the plane handled, forcing Boeing to get creative. The company added a new system that moves plates on the wing in part to reduce stress on the plane from its added weight. Boeing recreated the decades-old physical gauges on digital screens.\nAs Boeing pushed its engineers to figure out how to accommodate bigger, more fuel-efficient engines, height was again an issue. Simply lengthening the landing gear to make the plane taller could have violated rules for exiting the plane in an emergency.\nInstead, engineers were able to add just a few inches to the front landing gear and shift the engines farther forward on the wing. The engines fit, but the Max sat at a slightly uneven angle when parked.\nWhile that design solved one problem, it created another. The larger size and new location of the engines gave the Max the tendency to tilt up during certain flight maneuvers, potentially to a dangerous angle.\nTo compensate, Boeing engineers created the automated anti-stall system, called MCAS, that pushed the jet\u2019s nose down if it was lifting too high. The software was intended to operate in the background so that the Max flew just like its predecessor. Boeing didn\u2019t mention the system in its training materials for the Max.\nBoeing also designed the system to rely on a single sensor \u2014 a rarity in aviation, where redundancy is common. Several former Boeing engineers who were not directly involved in the system\u2019s design said their colleagues most likely opted for such an approach since relying on two sensors could still create issues. If one of two sensors malfunctioned, the system could struggle to know which was right.\nAirbus addressed this potential problem on some of its planes by installing three or more such sensors. Former Max engineers, including one who worked on the sensors, said adding a third sensor to the Max was a nonstarter. Previous 737s, they said, had used two and managers wanted to limit changes.\n\u201cThey wanted to A, save money and B, to minimize the certification and flight-test costs,\u201d said Mike Renzelmann, an engineer who worked on the Max\u2019s flight controls. \u201cAny changes are going to require recertification.\u201d Mr. Renzelmann was not involved in discussions about the sensors.\nThe Max also lacked more modern safety features.\nMost new Boeing jets have electronic systems that take pilots through their preflight checklists, ensuring they don\u2019t skip a step and potentially miss a malfunctioning part. On the Max, pilots still complete those checklists manually in a book.\nA second electronic system found on other Boeing jets also alerts pilots to unusual or hazardous situations during flight and lays out recommended steps to resolve them.\nOn 737s, a light typically indicates the problem and pilots have to flip through their paper manuals to find next steps. In the doomed Indonesia flight, as the Lion Air pilots struggled with MCAS for control, the pilots consulted the manual moments before the jet plummeted into the Java Sea, killing all 189 people aboard.\n\u201cMeanwhile, I\u2019m flying the jet,\u201d said Mr. Tajer, the American Airlines 737 captain. \u201cVersus, pop, it\u2019s on your screen. It tells you, This is the problem and here\u2019s the checklist that\u2019s recommended.\u201d\nBoeing decided against adding it to the Max because it could have prompted regulators to require new pilot training, according to two former Boeing employees involved in the decision.\nThe Max also runs on a complex web of cables and pulleys that, when pilots pull back on the controls, transfer that movement to the tail. By comparison, Airbus jets and Boeing\u2019s more modern aircraft, such as the 777 and 787, are \u201cfly-by-wire,\u201d meaning pilots\u2019 movement of the flight controls is fed to a computer that directs the plane. The design allows for far more automation, including systems that prevent the jet from entering dangerous situations, such as flying too fast or too low. Some 737 pilots said they preferred the cable-and-pulley system to fly-by-wire because they believed it gave them more control.\nIn the recent crashes, investigators believe the MCAS malfunctioned and moved a tail flap called the stabilizer, tilting the plane toward the ground. On the doomed Ethiopian Airlines flight, the pilots tried to combat the system by cutting power to the stabilizer\u2019s motor, according to the preliminary crash report.\nOnce the power was cut, the pilots tried to regain control manually by turning a wheel next to their seat. The 737 is the last modern Boeing jet that uses a manual wheel as its backup system. But Boeing has long known that turning the wheel is difficult at high speeds, and may have required two pilots to work together.\nIn the final moments of the Ethiopian Airlines flight, the first officer said the method wasn\u2019t working, according to the preliminary crash report. About 1 minute and 49 seconds later, the plane crashed, killing 157 people.", "date": "April 8, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/08/business/boeing-737-max-.html", "tags": "computing jet pilots boeing paper plane design \u201d system manuals power new max"}
