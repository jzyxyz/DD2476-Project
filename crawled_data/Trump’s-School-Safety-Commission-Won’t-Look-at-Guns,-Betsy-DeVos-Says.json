{"title": "Trump\u2019s School Safety Commission Won\u2019t Look at Guns, Betsy DeVos Says", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Education Secretary Betsy DeVos told a Senate committee on Tuesday that the federal commission on school safety set up this year after the Parkland, Fla., school massacre will not focus on the role guns play in school violence.\nThe comments, provided in testimony before the Senate subcommittee that oversees education spending, perplexed senators who questioned how the commission, led by Ms. DeVos and convened by President Trump, could avoid the subject when it was a military-style assault rifle that left 17 students and staff dead at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not part of the commission\u2019s charge, per se,\u201d Ms. DeVos said in response to a question from Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, about whether the commission would look at the role of firearms in the gun violence that has plagued the nation\u2019s schools.\n\u201cSo we\u2019ll look at gun violence in schools, but not look at guns? An interesting concept,\u201d Mr. Leahy said in response.\nMs. DeVos\u2019s comments came about 24 hours before the commission\u2019s first public forum, scheduled for Wednesday at the Education Department, where it will solicit feedback on solutions to improve school safety. And it comes after months of criticism \u2014 including from the students who survived the Marjory Stoneman Douglas attack that in their response to the school shootings, the nation\u2019s political leaders have zeroed in on everything but guns.\nShortly after Parkland, Republicans pointed to Obama-era school discipline policies as a potential culprit. As the gun-control legislation flagged in Congress, leaders shifted their focus toward measures that would beef up security at the nation\u2019s schools, including the possibility of arming teachers.\nIn recent weeks, the commission has held closed-door meetings with survivors of school attacks dating to the Columbine High School massacre in 1999, and last week Ms. DeVos visited a school in Maryland where she observed a popular discipline alternative strategy, called positive behavioral intervention and supports.\n\u201cOur focus is on raising up successful, proven techniques and approaches to ensuring schools are safe,\u201d Ms. DeVos said.\nWhen the White House announced the commission, it listed several areas the group would examine. The first was age restrictions on certain firearm purchases.\nThe commission\u2019s members include Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar II and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. It is charged with bringing \u201cmeaningful and actionable recommendations to keep students safe at school.\u201d\nAmong other areas, the commission is slated to examine ratings systems for video games, the consumption of \u201cviolent entertainment\u201d and the effects of news media coverage of mass shootings. The group is also charged with considering whether to repeal a package of Obama-era school discipline policies targeted at addressing disciplinary policies that disproportionately affect minority students. The commission is also looking to fund and bolster mental health and school infrastructure resources.\nLiz Hill, a spokeswoman for the department, clarified after the hearing that \u201cthe secretary and the commission continue to look at all issues the president asked the committee to study and are focused on making recommendations that the agencies, states and local communities can implement.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to note that the commission cannot create or amend current gun laws \u2014 that is the Congress\u2019s job,\u201d Ms. Hill said.\nBob Farrace, a spokesman for the National Association of Secondary School Principals, said, \u201cIf the commission won\u2019t address the role of guns in school violence, we hope that means it also won\u2019t recommend a proliferation of guns in schools \u2014 arming teachers, eliminating gun-free school zones and other ill-advised proposals that will make schools less safe.\u201d\nDuring the hearing, Ms. DeVos evaded questions that would draw her into the gun control debate.\nWhen Mr. Leahy asked whether she thought that an 18-year-old high school student should be able to walk into a store and purchase an AR-15 military-style weapon and hundreds of rounds of ammunition, Ms. DeVos pivoted.\n\u201cI know that this body and your counterparts have addressed a number of these issues, and I know that you\u2019re going to continue to debate them,\u201d she responded, adding that teenagers\u2019 access to guns was \u201cvery much a matter for debate.\u201d\nMr. Leahy replied, \u201cWell, you\u2019re studying things like how much time they spend on video games and all that, but you can go to a lot of other countries where they spend just as much time but have only a tiny fraction of the shootings that we do.\u201d\nSenator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, implored Ms. DeVos to look at the policies of other countries where school shootings are rare or nonexistent.\nMs. Shaheen cited statistics showing that school shootings in the United States \u201coccur at a scale far beyond any other industrialized nation.\u201d Since 2009, she said, the United States has had 57 times as many school shootings as the rest of the Group of 7 large advanced economies combined \u2014 288 in American schools, compared with two in Canada and France, one in Germany and zero in Japan, Italy and Britain.\n\u201cIt does seem to me that you should think about reworking the mission of the commission,\u201d she said.\nMs. DeVos said the commission would make its recommendations by the end of the year. Since the committee was announced in March, there has been at least one more mass shooting at a school.\nLast month, a 17-year-old student opened fire at his high school in Santa Fe, Tex., killing 10 people.", "date": "June 5, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/05/us/politics/devos-guns-school-safety-commission.html", "tags": "commission safety devos shootings \u201d trump ms. schools says look guns betsy school"}
