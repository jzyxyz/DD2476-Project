{"title": "Del Posto Doubles Down on Luxury", "content": "Deep beneath the dining room of Del Posto, the palatial Italian restaurant on 10th Avenue, stands a 50-gallon steel caldron that is employed for a single purpose: making chicken soup.\nThis is no ordinary Jewish penicillin. The kitchen crew led by Mark Ladner, the executive chef, concocts the elixir through a process that involves no fewer than 90 hens. Over three days, the flavor of the soup (which has been served since January in a few sips as part of the free \u201cassaggi\u201d courses that precede each meal) becomes more intensified with each wave of gently boiled poultry: 30 whole cleaned chickens, then another 30, then 30 again.\n\u201cIt\u2019s super-super-pure,\u201d Mr. Ladner said. \u201cIt\u2019s very extravagant.\u201d\nExtravagance \u2014 the chef sums it up as \u201clinen, crystal and silver\u201d \u2014 has been the stated mission at this cavernous restaurant with a sweeping central staircase ever since it opened 12 years ago. But in recent months, the management has chosen to buck the prevailing winds in local (and international) gastronomy.\nWhile countless chefs in this new-casual age of David Chang, Ignacio Mattos and April Bloomfield have veered from the protocols of white-tablecloth classicism \u2014 and even Del Posto\u2019s former pastry chef, Brooks Headley, now runs a tiny veggie burger joint called Superiority Burger \u2014 Del Posto\u2019s new strategy for continued relevance is to double down on fancy.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely countercultural right now,\u201d Mr. Ladner said toward the end of a recent lunch service while the sound of a grand piano crested in the background.\nIt is not uncommon for elite restaurants like Le Bernardin and Eleven Madison Park to refresh or reorient themselves every few years, and Del Posto has done its share of tinkering. (It received four stars from Sam Sifton in its last New York Times review, in 2010.) But its latest wave of luxury is meant to manifest itself across the board \u2014 in the food, the service and the d\u00e9cor.\nA meal now begins with the distribution of warmed hand towels that have been suffused with rosemary oil. At the center of each table glows a new candle-holding crystal bowl made by Rogaska in Slovenia. All of the white-leather chairs are new; they were handmade in Italy. Servers are wearing new suits from the Neapolitan design house Eidos.\nJeff Katz, the general manager, described the environmental goal as \u201ca civilized room full of beautiful stuff,\u201d which happened to be the royal norm for fine dining in New York City in the days before the stripped-down tasting-menu counters of Blanca and Momofuku Ko. There, the atmosphere suggests \u201cmore of a dinner party than a restaurant,\u201d Mr. Ladner said.\nBut Del Posto is sticking with the ancient sense of ceremony that used to be found in special-occasion restaurants. \u201cWe want you to feel kind of coddled in here,\u201d Mr. Katz said. \u201cSometimes you just want to sit in a comfortable chair and have a conversation without screaming.\u201d\nFor a while now, the restaurant has had an intricate network of menu options so that people who adhere to dietary restrictions (veganism, an avoidance of gluten, an aversion to garlic) will not feel shunned or limited. A prime example of Del Posto\u2019s freshly amplified luxury, though, comes in the form of a bread course in which dairy serves as a spherical showstopper.\nThe bread course at Del Posto used to involve several different kinds of baked goods, accompanied by a small tub of Italian butter and a second tub of whipped lardo. (Phasing out the famous lardo led to some institutional hand-wringing. \u201cThere was real concern that our regulars would be kind of upset about it,\u201d Mr. Katz said.)\nThe course has been refined down to a single baguette whose tips taper off into the crunchiness of grissini. The bread is accompanied by a ball of spreadable whiteness: Inspired by an aerated mozzarella that Mr. Ladner once swooned over at a restaurant in Sicily, it incorporates cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and cultured Battenkill Valley cream that are whipped almost to the brink of becoming butter and then transformed (using techniques popularized by molecular gastronomy) into tender, gleaming globes.\nFor special occasions, the new pastry chef, Justine MacNeil, and her crew have created a different kind of sphere, fashioned out of chocolate and about the size of a bocce ball. When customers crack it open at the table, hidden sweets fall out. Even the candy wrappers are custom-made. \u201cThey\u2019re talking about hand-stamping each one, and I\u2019m like, \u2018Please don\u2019t make me do that,\u2019\u201d Ms. MacNeil said.\nThe move toward extra opulence began about two years ago, when Mr. Katz, on a trip to Paris, ate dinner at Epicure, a restaurant in the Bristol hotel. Impressed and delighted by the grandeur of the meal, he spoke with the chef Mario Batali, who owns Del Posto with the chef Lidia Bastianich and her son, the restaurateur Joe Bastianich. Mr. Katz told Mr. Batali, \u201c\u2018We need to move, we need to go luxe \u2014 that\u2019s the play.\u2019\u201d\nThe result at Del Posto is so self-consciously lavish that it may seem a throwback \u2014 on purpose. \u201cIt\u2019s what my, and I\u2019ll bet your, dad imagines when he hears the term \u2018fine dining,\u2019\u201d Mr. Batali said.\nThat luxury is largely subsidized by a steady private dining business downstairs. \u201cIt keeps the lights on,\u201d Mr. Katz said. Mr. Batali said the restaurant had invested about $1 million in the upgrades.\nYet unlike tasting-menu restaurants like Blanca and Atera, which cater to a relatively rarefied clientele of food obsessives, Del Posto is engineered for a more all-encompassing embrace. At any given moment, you\u2019re apt to spy tourists, locals, high-finance types toasting big deals and families celebrating birthdays. \u201cWe spend a lot of energy trying to appeal to as broad a demographic as possible,\u201d Mr. Ladner said.\nThe service is meant to be both warmly conversational and classically buttoned-up. \u201cLike a big hug from Grandma,\u201d said Matt Abdoo, the chef de cuisine. \u201cIf Grandma happened to be Italian royalty.\u201d\nOn a recent afternoon, about an hour before the dinner crowd began to trickle in, Mr. Katz presided over a meeting with servers and suggested that they needed to apply more focus to the task of pulling out chairs for diners who were leaving or returning to their tables.\n\u201cWe need to just work on it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very rare to find a restaurant where they pull the chairs out for you.\u201d\nAn observation arose: Sometimes a guest is just too fast.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t chase the guests,\u201d Mr. Katz conceded. \u201cA better solution is to get ahead of the guest. There is a way to do it. You\u2019ve kind of got to want it.\u201d", "date": "April 5, 2016", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/06/dining/del-posto-restaurant-luxury.html", "tags": "del katz chef \u201d restaurant doubles posto luxury said \u2014"}
