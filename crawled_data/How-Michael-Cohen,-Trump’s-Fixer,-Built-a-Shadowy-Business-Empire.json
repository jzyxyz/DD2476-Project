{"title": "How Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s Fixer, Built a Shadowy Business Empire", "content": "He was a personal-injury lawyer who often worked out of taxi offices scattered around New York City.\nThere was the one above the run-down auto repair garage on West 16th Street in Manhattan, on the edge of the Meatpacking District before it turned trendy. There was the single-story building with the garish yellow awning in the shadow of the Queensboro Bridge. There was the tan brick place on a scruffy Manhattan side street often choked with double-parked taxis.\nAnd then there was his office on the 26th floor of Trump Tower overlooking Fifth Avenue, right next to the one belonging to Donald J. Trump.\nBefore he joined the Trump Organization and became Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyer and do-it-all fixer, Michael D. Cohen was a hard-edge personal-injury attorney and businessman. Now a significant portion of his quarter-century business record is under the microscope of federal prosecutors \u2014 posing a potential threat not just to Mr. Cohen but also to the president.\nMr. Cohen\u2019s businesses are private entities, making it difficult to get a full picture of their finances and operations. But a New York Times review of thousands of pages of public records, and interviews with bankers, lawyers and businessmen who have interacted with Mr. Cohen, reveal the degree to which he has often operated in the backwaters of the financial and legal worlds.\nWhile he has not been charged with a crime, many of his associates have faced either criminal charges or stiff regulatory penalties. That includes partners in the taxi business, doctors for whom he helped establish medical clinics and lawyers with whom he worked.\nHe has spent much of his personal and professional life with immigrants from Russia and Ukraine. His father-in-law, who helped establish him in the taxi business, was born in Ukraine, as was one of Mr. Cohen\u2019s partners in that industry. Another partner was Russian. And Mr. Cohen used his connections in the region when scouting business opportunities for Mr. Trump in former Soviet republics.\nMore recently, Mr. Cohen and his father-in-law lent more than $25 million to a Ukrainian businessman who has a checkered financial record and a history of defaulting on loans. And Mr. Cohen long held a small stake in his uncle\u2019s catering hall, which was frequented by Russian and Italian mobsters.\nIn addition to his legal and taxi businesses, Mr. Cohen has had a seemingly charmed touch as a real estate investor. On one day in 2014, he sold four buildings in Manhattan for $32 million, entirely in cash. That was nearly three times what he paid for them no more than three years earlier.\n\u201cThis is the type of person you\u2019d see most bankers steer clear of,\u201d said Ben Berzin, a retired executive vice president and senior credit officer at PNC Bank who clashed with Mr. Trump in the early 1990s over loans to the future president\u2019s troubled Atlantic City casinos. The speed with which Mr. Cohen successfully flipped real estate stands out, Mr. Berzin said. \u201cYou have to ask what\u2019s going on.\u201d\nRobert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, had already been examining Mr. Cohen\u2019s conduct as part of his ongoing inquiry. Last month, federal agents executed search warrants at Mr. Cohen\u2019s home, his office and a hotel room where he was staying. The warrants sought documents related to Mr. Cohen\u2019s business associates, among other things. That investigation, being conducted by the United States attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan, is apparently based on information provided by Mr. Mueller\u2019s team.\nMr. Trump\u2019s lawyers are resigned to the strong possibility that the investigation of Mr. Cohen\u2019s businesses could lead him to cooperate with federal prosecutors.\nMr. Cohen, after being sent a detailed list of questions about his business interests, responded in a text message, \u201cYou need to do real fact checking as your questions are totally inaccurate.\u201d Neither he nor his lawyers have offered further comment.\nMr. Trump, for his part, has said that Mr. Cohen was \u201ca good guy\u201d and that federal investigators were \u201clooking at something having to do with his business. I have nothing to do with his business.\u201d\nBut the president has long entrusted Mr. Cohen to represent him in matters both public and deeply private: real estate negotiations from Fresno, Calif., to the Republic of Georgia, and the hush-money payment to an adult-film actress who said she had had an affair with the future president. Or, as Mr. Trump put it, \u201cthis crazy Stormy Daniels deal.\u201d\nThe $130,000 payment to the actress is in a way emblematic of Mr. Cohen\u2019s many business dealings. Its provenance is murky, obfuscated by a private agreement, pseudonyms and evolving explanations. President Trump said this past week that he had paid Mr. Cohen a retainer that was used to reimburse the $130,000, directly contradicting his earlier statements that he knew of no payment to Ms. Daniels.\nWithin the Trump Organization, it was Mr. Cohen\u2019s job to deal with Mr. Trump\u2019s thorniest problems. But now, whatever problems investigators find in Mr. Cohen\u2019s own array of businesses could double back on Mr. Trump.\nThe son of a Holocaust survivor, Mr. Cohen grew up in the Five Towns area of Long Island, just east of the New York City borough of Queens. It was a comfortable life \u2014 both his father and an uncle were doctors, and he attended a local private school then called Woodmere Academy.\n\u201cMy cousins are all either lawyers or doctors,\u201d Mr. Cohen told The New York Times last year.\nOne of those relatives was his uncle Dr. Morton W. Levine. Uncle Morty, as he was known to his family, had no children of his own, and he and Mr. Cohen were close. He even let his nephew drive his Bentley.\nDr. Levine, a family practitioner, provided medical assistance to members of the Lucchese crime family, \u201cwhich aided their illegal activities,\u201d according to a sworn affidavit in 1993 from an F.B.I. special agent. The agent was involved in the investigation of the Lucchese underboss, Anthony (Gaspipe) Casso, who \u201cregarded Levine as someone who would do anything for him,\u201d according to the affidavit. That account was buttressed by testimony from a longtime Lucchese associate in an unrelated 2006 federal trial. In 1992, Dr. Levine bought Mr. Casso\u2019s home while Mr. Casso was a fugitive. Dr. Levine has acknowledged in court documents that Mr. Casso was a patient. But he said he did not know that the house belonged to Mr. Casso and denied any wrongdoing.\nDr. Levine also owned El Caribe, a Brooklyn catering hall that for decades was the scene of mob weddings and Christmas parties. Two of New York\u2019s most notorious Russian mobsters once maintained offices there.\nMr. Cohen was among the minority owners of El Caribe, Dr. Levine has said, although he added that Mr. Cohen gave up his ownership stake after the 2016 election.\nDr. Levine had crossed paths with Mr. Trump years before his nephew went to work for him. The doctor was part of an investment group with some garment executives that unsuccessfully challenged Mr. Trump\u2019s 1989 bid for the Atlantis Casino in Atlantic City.\nDr. Levine declined to comment.\nMr. Cohen began his professional legal career at a personal injury firm in 1992, the year after he graduated from Cooley Law School in Michigan. His boss at that first job would later plead guilty to bribery.\nMr. Cohen\u2019s marriage in 1994 gave him entree to communities of immigrants from the former Soviet Union.\nHis new father-in-law, Fima Shusterman, had emigrated from Ukraine in 1975. By the time of the wedding, Mr. Shusterman had landed in serious legal trouble. In 1993, he pleaded guilty to evading federal reporting requirements for large cash transactions, admitting that he had cashed $5.5 million worth of checks to evade disclosure laws. Mr. Shusterman cooperated with prosecutors in a related case and was sentenced to probation.\nIn the years after his marriage, Mr. Cohen began doing business with Ukrainian and Russian immigrants. They hailed from New York, Chicago and Florida, in neighborhoods like the Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn and parts of Miami like Sunny Isles, known as the Russian Riviera, communities through which a vein of organized crime ran.\nIn 1999, Mr. Cohen would find himself in the middle of a Sunny Isles real estate deal involving a hockey player and a purported figure from the Russian underworld.\nNearly 20 years later, the details of the transaction remain unclear, but Mr. Cohen received a check for $350,000 from a Russian player for the Montreal Canadiens that was part of a deal involving an apartment in Sunny Isles.\nThe player\u2019s agent later testified that the money was intended to go to Vitaly Buslaev. Mr. Buslaev, who has been identified by multiple Russian media outlets as a Mafia figure, was a friend of one of Mr. Cohen\u2019s business partners, according to two people who knew both men.\nMr. Cohen said in an interview last year that he did not know Mr. Buslaev. He declined to identify the person to whom he sent the $350,000, saying only that he had honored the athlete\u2019s request. \u201cThe money went to where it was directed to go,\u201d he said.\nMr. Cohen\u2019s ventures with business partners from the former Soviet Union continued, including a 2003 investment in a Florida casino boat with several Ukrainian immigrants that failed. After that, he helped members of his own family set up an ethanol production business in Ukraine.\nIt was through his wife\u2019s family that Mr. Cohen would be introduced to the taxi business, which would ultimately allow him to pull in millions of dollars.\nMr. Cohen\u2019s father-in-law, Mr. Shusterman, initially found work as a taxi driver after arriving in the United States. By 1993, he accumulated nine taxi medallions \u2014 the coveted metal placards that permit people to own or operate cabs \u2014 then worth roughly $1.5 million.\nMr. Shusterman circulated among his fellow taxi operators, trying to help Mr. Cohen find work. He introduced his son-in-law to Ilya Palinsky, a longtime fixture in the business. Mr. Palinsky said his impression of Mr. Cohen was that \u201che talks a lot, screams, you know. He\u2019s a hyper guy.\u201d\nNot long afterward, Mr. Cohen began building his own taxi business, even as he was taking on personal injury work as a lawyer.\nHe partnered with Symon Garber, another Ukrainian-born businessman, who was borrowing large amounts of money to finance taxi businesses in both Russia and the United States. A lawyer for the two men said in a court filing that he had helped them lay the groundwork for a planned taxi business in Moscow in the mid-1990s, although it never materialized.\nMr. Cohen borrowed from a half-dozen banks and credit unions to buy taxi medallions. Then he used the medallions as collateral to borrow more money to buy more medallions, former colleagues said. He quickly amassed 30 medallions, each then worth about $250,000, but racked up millions in debt.\nTogether, the two men managed 260 cabs in the late 1990s and early 2000s, some for other owners. Drivers paid them $100 a shift. Millions of dollars in cash flowed in. Mr. Cohen at some point began carrying a licensed pistol in an ankle holster.\nIn 2007, Mr. Cohen started working for the Trump Organization. While there are varying accounts of how he met his new boss, Mr. Trump said Mr. Cohen appeared on his radar after he began buying up properties in Trump buildings \u2014 by then, Mr. Cohen\u2019s office addresses included tony Fifth Avenue locations. For his part, Mr. Cohen has said that the job came after he helped resolve a board dispute at one of the Trump buildings where his family owned several units.\nMr. Cohen became a roving fixer for Mr. Trump. In his first year on the job, he and Ivanka Trump kicked the tires on a potential golf course development project in Fresno, Calif. A year later, he was named chief operating officer of Affliction Entertainment, a mixed martial arts venture that Mr. Trump had started. Mr. Cohen traveled to the former Soviet bloc on Mr. Trump\u2019s behalf, visiting Georgia in 2010. He even scouted out Iowa for Mr. Trump ahead of the 2012 presidential campaign and set up a website called ShouldTrumpRun.org.\nDuring Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, Mr. Cohen pursued plans for a Trump Tower in Moscow with Felix Sater, a Russian immigrant and friend of Mr. Cohen, who had worked on other real estate development deals with Mr. Trump and had explored possible ventures in Russia. Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen worked with Mr. Sater even after his role in a stock manipulation scheme involving Mafia figures and Russian criminals was revealed. (Mr. Sater pleaded guilty and became an informant for the F.B.I. and intelligence agencies.)\nWhile juggling his Trump duties, Mr. Cohen turned over management of his cabs to Mr. Garber in 2006 and received as much as $1 million per year, legal records show. After a falling-out with Mr. Garber, Mr. Cohen became partners with Evgeny Freidman, known as Gene, an immigrant from St. Petersburg, Russia, who had assembled a large taxi fleet.\nBoth of Mr. Cohen\u2019s taxi partners had a history of legal run-ins. Each has been made to pay more than $1 million for overcharging their drivers, according to the New York State attorney general. Former business partners also accused each of them of forging signatures, stiffing lawyers and dodging debt collection efforts.\nThe Chicago authorities found that Mr. Garber and his taxi businesses used 180 unauthorized cars as taxis in that city; he agreed to pay a fine of nearly $1 million.\nIn 2016, a federal judge found that Mr. Freidman had transferred more than $60 million into offshore trusts to avoid paying debts. Last April, New York City regulators barred him from continuing to manage medallions. He currently is awaiting trial in Albany on charges he failed to pay $5 million in taxes.\nDespite the prohibition issued by city regulators, Mr. Freidman is still managing Mr. Cohen\u2019s medallions, both men have said.\n\u201cCohen associated himself with the most reckless and greedy players in the industry,\u201d said Bhairavi Desai, the executive director of the Taxi Workers Alliance, a group that represents cabdrivers. \u201cThey have simultaneously worked to inflate the value of their medallions and rip off their drivers.\u201d\nPatrick J. Egan, a lawyer for Mr. Freidman, said his client denies all the allegations against him. Mr. Freidman, he said, has been the victim of \u201cfabricated claims\u201d by former colleagues and politically motivated prosecutors.\nMr. Garber did not respond to requests for comment.\nFrom 2009 to 2014, Mr. Cohen \u2014 by then a trusted member of the Trump Organization \u2014 plowed $5.7 million into 22 Chicago taxi medallions, records show.\nThe investments were ill timed. The ascent of ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft decimated the value of medallions. Since 2014, Mr. Cohen\u2019s companies have been falling behind on taxes. Over all, his taxi businesses in New York and Chicago owe more than $375,000 for a variety of tax, insurance and inspection problems, according to records. Fourteen of his 54 cabs were suspended.\nBut even as the industry has buckled, Mr. Cohen has continued to use his medallions as collateral to borrow money. In December 2014, with his medallions worth $35 million, he took out loans totaling at least $20 million from Sterling National Bank and Melrose Credit Union, according to a banker who reviewed the transactions. (Documents related to both lenders were among the materials sought by federal prosecutors in their search warrants.)\nIn 2016, Mr. Cohen went so far as to dabble in financial engineering. He spoke to investors about pooling distressed loans that financed taxi medallion purchases, repackaging them and selling them to investors, according to a person with direct knowledge of the discussions. He also explored buying up such loans at a bargain price in anticipation that their value would recover, the person said. The outcome of those discussions was not clear.\nThe financial maneuvering has continued even after the federal search warrants were executed. On April 24, Mr. Cohen refinanced all 16 of his taxi company medallion loans. The transactions, with Sterling National Bank, appeared to extend the due dates on the loans by four years, according to public filings on the refinanced loans. And they added a new, unusual source of collateral: If Mr. Cohen were to default, Sterling would have the right to any money that Mr. Freidman owes Mr. Cohen.\nMany of Mr. Freidman\u2019s taxi companies have declared bankruptcy. Asked about the loans, Mr. Freidman\u2019s lawyer said his client had \u201cno assets\u201d that could be used as collateral.\nSpokesmen for Sterling and Melrose declined to comment.\nIt was unclear what Mr. Cohen has done with all the money he has borrowed in recent years. But he received some of the funds around the time that he and his father-in-law, Mr. Shusterman, lent a combined $26 million to a Ukrainian immigrant and taxi-fleet operator named Semyon Shtayner, real estate records show.\nThe transactions were unusual: Mr. Shtayner has had nearly $1.7 million in judgments and liens against him over the years, yet Mr. Cohen made large loans backed by collateral that appears to be worth less than the value of the loans.\nSince 2012, Mr. Cohen has lent $6 million to Mr. Shtayner, whose family owns Chicago Medallion Management Corporation, which manages more than 300 cabs in that city \u2014 including those owned by Mr. Cohen. The only collateral on the loans appears to be the Shtayners\u2019 condominium in Sunny Isles, purchased in 2009 for $2.35 million.\nNevertheless, Mr. Cohen and his father-in-law were willing lenders to Mr. Shtayner, who recently entered the marijuana cultivation business in Nevada.\nSince last summer, Mr. Shusterman has lent $20 million to Mr. Shtayner\u2019s wife, Yasya, and two limited liability companies she controls.\n\u201cThis is a business exchange, that\u2019s it,\u201d Yasya Shtayner said in a brief phone interview, when questioned about the loans from Mr. Cohen. Asked whether she had a lawyer who could speak on her behalf, she said yes. Then she hung up.\nAfter he had built a taxi operation and a personal injury legal practice, there was another element to Mr. Cohen\u2019s business dealings, this one involving doctors and companies that operated on the fringes of the medical field.\nStarting in 2000, Mr. Cohen set up a series of companies in New York City. There were two medical practices, an acupuncture office, two medical billing companies, two management companies and a transportation company.\nThe ventures were noteworthy, in part, because they were created at a time when countless phony companies were cropping up to exploit so-called no-fault auto insurance laws in New York and other states. Hundreds of doctors, businesses owners and others would eventually be criminally charged or accused of fraud by insurance companies.\nThere is no evidence that Mr. Cohen or the companies he created were part of such schemes. Nor is there evidence that Mr. Cohen did anything other than register the companies with state authorities.\nThe no-fault insurance schemes, which were often masterminded by organized crime figures from the former Soviet Union, all followed a basic template. Staged or exaggerated car accidents were used to generate a tidal wave of \u201cpatients.\u201d Transportation companies then took the patients \u2014 often low-level criminals \u2014 to what in many instances were sham medical clinics, diagnostic testing offices, and acupuncture and physical therapy offices. Billing companies were created to collect money from insurers, and management companies then siphoned the funds out to the scheme\u2019s operators. Some operators were so bold that they sued insurers that had stopped paying after they realized they were being defrauded.\nMr. Cohen\u2019s role, if any, in the operation of the companies he helped set up was unclear. The only people listed in the incorporation papers as having roles in the businesses are the two doctors, Aleksandr Martirosov and Zhanna Kanevsky, who were each affiliated with a medical practice.\nBut both of those doctors were accused of insurance fraud in connection with different medical practices they operated.\nDr. Martirosov was arrested and charged with insurance fraud and grand larceny in 2003. A little more than a year earlier, Mr. Cohen had registered Avex Medical Care in Dr. Martirosov\u2019s name.\nIn 2005, Dr. Kanevsky was indicted on state racketeering charges, the result of a lengthy wiretap investigation into phony accidents and medical claims. Mr. Cohen had registered Life Quality Medical Care on Dr. Kanevsky\u2019s behalf in April 2002.\nDr. Kanevsky pleaded guilty to scheming to defraud in the second degree. A man who answered two phone numbers listed in her name said \u201cno comment\u201d and hung up.\nThe charges against Dr. Martirosov were later dropped. He did not respond to calls for comment or a message left at his home. The same year he was arrested, Dr. Martirosov was named in a civil racketeering lawsuit brought by the insurance company Allstate, in connection with his work for another medical business. The suit accused dozens of doctors and business owners of trying to defraud insurers. Dr. Martirosov denied wrongdoing.\nAvex Medical Care continued to operate after Dr. Martirosov\u2019s arrest. The company later sued insurers at a frenetic pace that averaged almost one lawsuit a week from 2003 to 2008. The suits targeted insurers that had balked at paying for treatments for accident victims.\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, Mr. Cohen\u2019s personal injury practice filed hundreds of lawsuits largely stemming from auto accidents. For part of that time, a bustling bullpen of clerks and paralegals worked the phones at his Long Island City office. They sought settlements with insurers and churned out suits on behalf of clients, many of whom were referred to clinics that were later caught up in no-fault insurance fraud investigations.\nOne of the personal injury lawsuits that Mr. Cohen filed was in connection to a 1999 auto accident in the Sheepshead Bay neighborhood of Brooklyn. Both his client and the defendant were later indicted on insurance fraud charges related to the accident, Rolling Stone recently reported. The lawsuit filed by Mr. Cohen was dropped.\nDuring his time working at the Trump Organization, Mr. Cohen became a minor real estate baron in his own right.\nWhile his business is dwarfed by Mr. Trump\u2019s assemblage of properties, it is not insignificant. From 2011 to 2015, limited liability companies connected to Mr. Cohen purchased at least five buildings in Manhattan, public records show.\nLike many of Mr. Cohen\u2019s business dealings, the transactions were unconventional. His companies would buy a building, often in cash. Soon after, they would flip the building in another all-cash deal for four or five times the previous purchase price. The buyer was generally another limited liability company.\nIn October 2011, for example, a limited liability company listing as its address Mr. Cohen\u2019s apartment at Trump Park Avenue purchased a building on Rivington Street on Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side for $2.1 million. In 2014, Mr. Cohen sold the building for $10 million in cash \u2014 nearly five times what he paid three years earlier.\nThat same day, Mr. Cohen sold three other Manhattan buildings, also entirely for cash. In total, the four buildings sold for $32 million \u2014 nearly triple what Mr. Cohen had paid for them in the span of no more than three years.\nIt is not known who owns the limited liability companies that purchased the properties from Mr. Cohen or why they agreed to pay such rich prices. Mr. Cohen told McClatchy, which first reported the transactions, that the sales were in cash to help the buyers defer taxes in other transactions.\nRichard K. Gordon, director of the Financial Integrity Institute at Case Western Reserve University\u2019s law school, said that such real estate transactions \u2014 large profits, achieved quickly, involving cash purchases by L.L.C.s \u2014 should raise red flags.\n\u201cIf I were the bank, I\u2019d either refuse his business up front or rate him extra high risk,\u201d said Mr. Gordon, who once led anti-money-laundering efforts for the International Monetary Fund.\nMr. Trump is closely monitoring the investigations into his longtime counselor. In recent weeks, he has moved to simultaneously embrace Mr. Cohen and keep him at arm\u2019s length.\n\u201cMost people will flip if the Government lets them out of trouble,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter last month. \u201cSorry, I don\u2019t see Michael doing that.\u201d\nA few days later, Mr. Trump asserted that the investigation was unrelated to Mr. Cohen\u2019s work for him.\n\u201cFrom what I understand, they\u2019re looking at his businesses,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI\u2019ve been told I\u2019m not involved.\u201d\nThe president added: \u201cI hope he\u2019s in great shape.\u201d", "date": "May 5, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/05/business/michael-cohen-lawyer-trump.html", "tags": "business companies \u201d trump cohen fixer shadowy michael million taxi built empire said"}
