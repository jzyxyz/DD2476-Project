{"title": "Meghan Markle\u2019s Wedding Dress Was Made for a Person, Not a Princess", "content": "It was absolutely simple: pure, sculptural, with a wide boatneck, long sleeves and sweeping train. \nIt was Meghan Markle\u2019s wedding dress. It was haute couture by Clare Waight Keller for Givenchy, a British woman who was the first female designer of the storied French brand. And it was everything people had hoped.\nIt was not a Cinderella choice, not one that spoke of fantasy or old-fashioned fairy tales, but one that placed the woman proudly front and center. It underscored Ms. Markle\u2019s own independence by divesting her of frippery, while also respecting tradition and keeping her covered up. It celebrated female strength in the rigorous nature of its line \u2014 six exactingly placed seams \u2014 the substance of its fabric (double-bonded silk cady), and the choice of designer: a British woman who, as a statement from Kensington Palace read, had \u201cserved as the creative head of three globally influential fashion houses \u2014 Pringle of Scotland, Chlo\u00e9, and now Givenchy.\u201d \nIt had an edge of Hollywood: Givenchy, after all, was the house made famous by Audrey Hepburn, and Ms. Markle\u2019s dress had a Hepburn feel, acknowledgement of her former career as well, perhaps, of a role model who devoted her post-film career to UNICEF.\nAnd it extended a hand across the water: to Europe, where Ms. Waight Keller takes the Eurostar twice a week to her maison \u2014 Givenchy also, by the by, made Ms. Markle\u2019s wedding shoes, which are silk duchesse satin, and the bridesmaid\u2019s dresses \u2014 and to all the countries of the Commonwealth, which were represented in Ms. Markle\u2019s veil.\nFive meters (that\u2019s a little over 16 feet) long and made from silk tulle, the veil was \u201ca vision Meghan and I shared,\u201d according to a statement from Ms. Waight Keller. It was embroidered with the flowers of all 53 Commonwealth nations along the edge, each one different, to represent the roles Ms. Markle and Prince Harry will assume as Youth Ambassadors to the wider British world. Also included were wintersweet, a British flowering plant, to represent Kensington Palace and Ms. Markle\u2019s new home, and the California poppy, her home state\u2019s flower. And it was held in place by Queen Mary\u2019s diamond and platinum bandeau tiara, made in 1932 with a centerpiece of a diamond brooch from Queen Mary\u2019s wedding in 1893, which had been lent to Ms. Markle by the queen and described a \u201ca flexible band of eleven sections.\u201d \n\u201cFlexible\u201d being a word that this couple, and this wedding, has managed, to everyone\u2019s great surprise, to attach to the formerly-perceived-as-entirely-rigid royal family.\n\u201cAs a British designer at a Parisian haute couture house, and on behalf of all of us at Givenchy who have been able to experience such an extraordinary process of creativity, I am extremely proud of what we have accomplished and grateful to Meghan Markle, Prince Harry and Kensington Palace for allowing us to be part of this historical chapter,\u201d said Ms. Waight Keller in her statement.\nSpeaking of surprise though, perhaps the most surprising thing of all was that in this age of rampant leaks and gossip, Ms. Markle had managed to keep all of this completely secret. In all the rumors that had swirled around The Dress \u2014 with the Daily Mail announcing with confidence it was Ralph & Russo and Page Six claiming rather Stella McCartney and book makers putting odds on Burberry and Erdem Moralioglu (indeed, the Royal College of Art mistakenly tweeted out that Mr. Moralioglu had actually made The Dress, before having to amend the news and acknowledge it was another of their alumna, Ms. Waight Keller) \u2014 Ms. Waight Keller\u2019s name had never even once come up. \nIn the end, Ms. Markle did exactly what she promised: she brought change and out-thought us all, in her dress as in her entire wedding ceremony. Long may such smart symbolism continue.\nAnd the symbolism did not stop with the new Duchess of Sussex and her dress. There were all sorts of fashion statements being made by family and guests at this wedding, seemingly in honor of Ms. Markle, this marriage and what the marriage represents.\nCatherine, Duchess of Cambridge, for example, was wearing Alexander McQueen \u2014 the same brand she wore to her own wedding, and one designed by Sarah Burton, yet another female British creative force. \nIndeed, British women designers were everywhere: Both Amal Clooney, in mustard yellow silk cady with a side drape, and Oprah Winfrey, in tiers of peach sustainable viscose, were wearing Stella McCartney, who is known for both her feminism and sustainability, causes close to Ms. Markle\u2019s heart. Priyanka Chopra was in Vivienne Westwood, and Victoria Beckham was in \u2014 well, Victoria Beckham.\nMeanwhile, yellow and new grass green were the dominant colors: on the Duchess of Cambridge; Doria Ragland, Ms. Markle\u2019s mother, wore an Oscar de la Renta coat and dress the shade of fresh pea shoots; and the queen, in bright lime green and lemon Stewart Parvin with a lilac print and trim. \nAll of which, if we are going the semiological route (and we should since the forever import of this wedding has escaped no one), are colors that signal optimism, happiness and a new dawn. Let them shine.", "date": "May 19, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/19/style/meghan-markle-wedding-dress.html", "tags": "meghan wedding dress waight markle person one princess british keller ms. made \u2014"}
