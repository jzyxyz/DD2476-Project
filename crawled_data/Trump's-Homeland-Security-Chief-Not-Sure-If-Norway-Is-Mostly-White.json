{"title": "Trump's Homeland Security Chief Not Sure If Norway Is Mostly White", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2015 President Donald Trump\u2019s Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said Tuesday that she doesn\u2019t know if Norway is predominantly white.\nTestifying under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Nielsen dodged questions about the president reportedly saying last week, in a White House meeting about immigration, that African countries are a \u201cshithole\u201d and that he preferred that immigrants come from Norway instead. Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) pressed Nielsen on the racism driving Trump\u2019s comments, but Nielsen wouldn\u2019t acknowledge it.\n\u201cBeing from Norway is not a skill,\u201d Leahy said. \u201cWhat does he mean when he said that?\u201d\n\u201cWhat he was referencing is, from a merit-based perspective, we\u2019d like to have those with skills who can assimilate and contribute to the United States, moving away from country quotas and to an individual merit-based system,\u201d Nielsen replied.\n\u201cNorway is a predominantly white country, isn\u2019t it?\u201d continued Leahy.\n\u201cI actually do not know that, sir,\u201d Nielsen said, \u201cbut I imagine that is the case.\u201d\nHere\u2019s a video of their exchange:\u00a0\nNorway, of course, is one of the whitest countries in the world. It\u2019s residents are 83 percent Norwegian, who are ethnic North Germanic people, and another 8 percent is European,\u00a0according to\u00a0the CIA\u2019s World Factbook.\u00a0\nSen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) questioned Nielsen\u2019s ability to do her job if she doesn\u2019t know the general makeup of other countries.\n\u201cWhen you say you don\u2019t know if Norway is predominantly white when asked by a member of the United States Senate, that causes me concern about your ability to understand the scope of your responsibilities and the impact of your words, much less the policies that you promulgate in that very important department,\u201d said Harris.\nNielsen\u2019s answer is bad either way you cut it. If she did know this but wanted to give cover to Trump, she may have just lied under oath. If she somehow did not know that Scandinavian countries are whiter than a pack of arctic foxes rolling through a snow drift,\u00a0the head of the Department of Homeland Security is unaware of basic global demographics.\nNielsen also told senators she could not recall if Trump used the world \u201cshithole\u201d to describe African nations, even though she was in the meeting where he said it, the White House has not denied he said it and Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) has publicly confirmed he said it.", "date": "\n01/16/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kirstjen-neilsen-norway-white-trump_n_5a5e2a44e4b0fcbc3a13dbb4", "tags": "security mostly sure know nielsen chief white trump homeland \u201d countries norway predominantly"}
