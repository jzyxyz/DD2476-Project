{"title": "Obamacare To Be Central To Democrats' Fight Against Trump's Supreme Court Pick", "content": "The Trump administration\u2019s decision to join a conservative lawsuit challenging some of the most popular parts of the Affordable Care Act continues to be the gift that keeps on giving, at least politically, for Democrats \u2015 first in the midterms and now in the upcoming Supreme Court fight.\u00a0\nLast month, the Justice Department threw its support behind a lawsuit arguing that Obamacare\u2019s protections for people with pre-existing conditions are unconstitutional.\nFrom a political perspective, the move was confounding. Polls show that the majority of the public approves of the law, in large part because of popular provisions like the pre-existing conditions mandate. And Democrats have the upper hand on the issue.\u00a0\nA recent poll also found that 76 percent of voters, including 58 percent of Republicans, say coverage for pre-existing conditions is \u201cvery important\u201d to them.\nDemocrats immediately went to town on the suit, blasting out ads and fundraising emails warning that the Trump administration wants to take away coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.\nAnd now, Democrats say they plan to use the suit to their advantage when Trump picks his Supreme Court nominee, expected to be announced July 9.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe lawsuit, brought by 20 states led by Republicans, argues that the law\u2019s protections were supposed to work in tandem with the mandate that individuals have health insurance. Because Congress is no longer enforcing the mandate, they say, insurers no longer have to sell policies to everyone regardless of medical status.\nDemocratic senators are assuredly going to question the nominee as to whether he or she supports Trump\u2019s position on the lawsuit. Normally, nominees punt on these sorts of questions, arguing that the issue could come before them if they are confirmed to the court.\u00a0\nWithout a firm answer, Democrats will likely turn to the nominee\u2019s past rulings and writings, and, of course, Trump\u2019s own tweets. In 2015, when the Supreme Court upheld the Affordable Care Act \u2015 thanks to votes from Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy, who is retiring \u2015 Trump promised he would choose only people who would strike down the law.\u00a0\n\u201cThe president\u2019s made abundantly clear that his plan all along has been to destroy the Affordable Care Act,\u201d said Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic consultant who works with health care groups.\u00a0\u201cFirst was by repeal, then it was going to be by lawsuit, and now he\u2019s going to try to pick the judge to rule on the lawsuit.\u201d\nThe pro-Obamacare group Protect Our Care has already launched a TV ad urging senators to \u201cstop any nominee who will support Trump\u2019s lawsuit that overturns health care protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\u201d It will be running in Washington, D.C., as well as in Bangor, Maine, and Anchorage, Alaska \u2015 where Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski will be sure to see the spot, since they\u2019re considered the two Republicans most likely to potentially vote against a Trump pick.\nThe anti-Obamacare lawsuit is considered weak, even among some conservatives. A group of liberal, conservative, and libertarian legal scholars filed an amicus brief arguing that it would be \u201cunlawful\u201d for a court to go along with what the conservative states want.\u00a0\nThe Supreme Court fight will also force Republicans to start talking about health care more in the months before the midterm elections \u2015 something they don\u2019t seem all that excited to do.\u00a0GOP spending on TV ads mentioning Obamacare has plummeted compared with previous election cycles, while Democratic spending is up slightly. Democrats also consistently say it\u2019s their top issue for the midterms.\u00a0\nWith Kennedy retiring, Roberts \u2015 a conservative justice appointed by George W. Bush \u2015 will likely become the swing vote on Obamacare. In addition to health care, Democrats are going to be emphasizing the threat to abortion access\u00a0from potential justices, since Kennedy has long been the main obstacle to overturning the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. Trump has promised to nominate justices who will overturn the ruling and ban abortion rights.", "date": "\n07/03/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/obamacare-trump-supreme-court_n_5b3a7ab4e4b09e4a8b262965", "tags": "lawsuit obamacare democrats court pre-existing \u201d trump supreme \u2015 pick fight central care health"}
