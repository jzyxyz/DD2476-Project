{"title": "Light Sentence for Brock Turner in Stanford Rape Case Draws Outrage", "content": "A recall effort against a California judge was announced on Monday in a sexual assault case at Stanford University that ignited public outrage after the defendant was sentenced to a mere six months in jail and his father complained that his son\u2019s life had been ruined for \u201c20 minutes of action\u201d fueled by alcohol and promiscuity.\nIn court, the victim had spoken out against the inequities of the legal process, arguing that the trial, the sentencing and the legal system\u2019s approach to sexual assault \u2014 from the defense lawyer\u2019s questions about what she wore that night to her attacker\u2019s sentence \u2014 were irrevocably marred by male and class privilege.\nThe case, which had made headlines after the suspect was found guilty in March, began to seize the public\u2019s attention anew after a Santa Clara County Superior Court judge, Aaron Persky, on Thursday handed the defendant, Brock Allen Turner, 20, what many critics denounced as a lenient sentence, including three years\u2019 probation, for three felony counts of sexual assault.\nAccording to the judge: \u201cA prison sentence would have a severe impact on him. I think he will not be a danger to others.\u201d\nThe next day, BuzzFeed published the full courtroom statement by the woman who was attacked. The statement, a 7,244-word cri de coeur against the role of privilege in the trial and the way the legal system deals with sexual assault, was provided by the victim and has since gone viral. By Monday, it had been viewed more than five million times on the BuzzFeed site.\nAlso on Monday, the CNN anchor Ashleigh Banfield spent part of an hour looking into the camera and reciting the entire statement live on the air.\nThe unidentified 23-year-old victim, who was not a student of the university in Palo Alto, Calif., was attacked while visiting the campus, where she attended a fraternity party. In the statement, she spoke of drinking at the party, but not remembering the assault in January 2015.\nShe said she was told she had been found behind a Dumpster, and learned from news reports that witnesses had discovered her attacker lying on top of her unconscious, partly clothed body. The witnesses intervened and held the attacker for the police.\nThe judge, identified by The Guardian as a Stanford alumnus, handed Mr. Turner, a champion swimmer, far less than the maximum 14 years after he was convicted, pointing out that he had no \u201csignificant\u201d prior offenses, he had been affected by the intense media coverage, and \u201cthere is less moral culpability attached to the defendant, who is ... intoxicated,\u201d The Guardian said.\nThe victim said Mr. Turner had admitted drinking, but still had not acknowledged any fault in the attack, insisting the episode had been consensual. She said the court privileged his well-being over her own, and in the end declined to punish him severely because the authorities considered the disruption to his studies and athletic career at a prestigious university when determining his sentence. She wrote:\nMichele Dauber, a law professor and sociologist at Stanford, said Monday that she was part of a committee that was organizing a recall challenge to Judge Persky, whose position is an elected one. And by Tuesday, a Change.org petition calling for the judge\u2019s removal had garnered over 240,000 supporters.\nProfessor Dauber said the judge had misapplied the law by granting Mr. Turner probation and by taking his age, academic achievement and alcohol consumption into consideration.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to declare that a high-achieving perpetrator is an unusual case, then you\u2019re saying to women on college campuses that they don\u2019t deserve the full protection of the law in the state of California,\u201d the professor said.\nOn Sunday, Professor Dauber posted to Twitter a statement read to the court by the defendant\u2019s father, Dan Turner.\nMr. Turner\u2019s father said that his son should not do jail time for the sexual assault, which he referred to as \u201cthe events\u201d and \u201c20 minutes of action\u201d that were not violent. He said that his son suffered from depression and anxiety in the wake of the trial and argued that having to register as a sex offender \u2014 and the loss of his appetite for food he once enjoyed \u2014 was punishment enough.\nBrock Turner also lost a swimming scholarship to Stanford and has given up on his goal of competing at the Olympics.\n\u201cI was always excited to buy him a big rib-eye steak to grill or to get his favorite snack for him,\u201d Dan Turner wrote. \u201cNow he barely consumes any food and eats only to exist. These verdicts have broken and shattered him and our family in so many ways.\u201d\nIn a statement, the Santa Clara, Calif., district attorney, Jeff Rosen, said the sentence \u201cdid not fit the crime,\u201d and he called Brock Turner, who withdrew from Stanford, a \u201cpredatory offender\u201d who refused to take responsibility or show remorse.\n\u201cCampus rape is no different than off-campus rape,\u201d Mr. Rosen said. \u201cRape is rape.\u201d\nIn an editorial, The San Jose Mercury News called the sentence \u201ca slap on the wrist\u201d and \u201ca setback for the movement to take campus rape seriously.\u201d\nJudge Persky did not respond to a request for comment sent to Santa Clara County Superior Court on Monday.\nStanford University said on Monday that it \u201ctakes the issue of sexual assault extremely seriously\u201d and was proud of two students who intervened to stop Mr. Turner\u2019s attack.\n\u201cThere is still much work to be done, not just here, but everywhere, to create a culture that does not tolerate sexual violence in any form and a judicial system that deals appropriately with sexual assault cases,\u201d the university said in a statement.\nIn his statement, Dan Turner said his son planned to use his time on probation to educate college students \u201cabout the dangers of alcohol consumption and sexual promiscuity\u201d so that he could \u201cgive back to society in a net positive way.\u201d\nThe victim, however, rebuked that proposal:", "date": "June 6, 2016", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/07/us/outrage-in-stanford-rape-case-over-dueling-statements-of-victim-and-attackers-father.html", "tags": "sentence rape stanford draws outrage judge \u201d turner statement sexual brock case monday assault light"}
