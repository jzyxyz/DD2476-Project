They belonged to a group that espoused \u201csovereign citizen, anti-government, anti-Muslim, and anti-immigrant extremist beliefs,\u201d according to an FBI agent\u2019s affidavit, and\u00a0allegedly plotted to attack Muslim immigrants, focusing on an apartment complex in Garden City, Kansas.\nAccording to the Department of Justice, the trio allegedly stockpiled firearms, ammunition and explosive materials, and discussed parking four vehicles filled with explosives at the four corners of the apartment complex in order to set off a massive explosion.\u00a0\nThe attack, which the men allegedly said would \u201cwake people up,\u201d was planned for Nov. 9, one day after the presidential election, according to the DOJ.\u00a0\nThe FBI had been investigating Stein, Wright and Allen since February and documented their violent rhetoric, excerpts of which appear uncensored below.\u00a0\nStein allegedly said that \u201cthe only good Muslim is a dead Muslim\u201d and that he would \u201cenjoy\u201d shooting Muslims\u2019 heads. \u201cWhen we go on operations, there\u2019s no leaving anyone behind, even if it\u2019s a one-year-old, I\u2019m serious. I guarantee, if I go on a mission, those little fuckers are going bye-bye,\u201d he said, according to the FBI.\nStein allegedly conducted surveillance on at least three different occasions, and discussed targeting churches that had supported refugees. At a July 2016 meeting at Wright\u2019s mobile home business, where Allen worked, the three allegedly plotted attacking city and county commission meetings and even landlords who rented to Muslim refugees.\nThey ultimately settled on the apartment complex in Garden City, and began ordering the materials they would need to create bombs.\u00a0\nAt some point, the FBI introduced an undercover agent to work with the confidential source they\u2019d been using to watch the group. The agent provided automatic weapons, and even allowed Stein to fire them when they met on Oct. 12.\nDuring one conference call, Stein allegedly said, \u201cThe only fucking way this country\u2019s ever going to get turned around is it will be a bloodbath and it will be a nasty, messy motherfucker. Unless a lot more people in this country wake up and smell the fucking coffee and decide they want this country back \u2026 we might be too late, if they do wake up \u2026 I think we can get it done. But it ain\u2019t going to be nothing nice about it.\u201d\nStein also allegedly referred to the group\u2019s targets, Somali immigrants, as \u201ccockroaches,\u201d discussed dipping bullets in pig\u2019s blood before using them, and\u00a0\u201cyelled at Somali women dressed in traditional garb, calling them \u2018fucking raghead bitches.\u2019\u201d\nAll three men\u2019s Facebook pages contain links to articles on conspiracy websites, many of which are anti-Muslim in nature. In May, Allen shared an article about a Dutch politician who purportedly called for a ban on Islam and the closing of all mosques. \u201cWow someone finally decided too [sic] open there [sic] eyes and pay attention to this cult!!!!\u201d Allen commented. Also in May, Stein shared an article from a website called Militia News about the \u201cMuslim conquest of America.\u201d\u00a0\nThe men\u2019s arrests come amid a surge in hate crimes targeting Muslims or those perceived to be Muslim.\nMosques in the U.S. have suffered vandalism, arson and other types of destruction 78 times in 2015, according to a report from the Council on American-Islamic Relations. That\u2019s a nearly 400 percent jump from 2014.\nAnother report from the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at the California State University, San Bernardino, documented 260 hate crimes targeting Muslims in 2015 \u2015 a nearly 80 percent rise from the year before, and the highest annual number of such crimes since 2001.\nThe Huffington Post has also tracked nearly 290 acts of anti-Muslim violence, discrimination and political speech in the U.S.\nThe Huffington Post is documenting the rising wave of anti-Muslim bigotry and violence in America.
