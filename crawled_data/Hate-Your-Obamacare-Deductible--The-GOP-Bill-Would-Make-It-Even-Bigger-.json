{"title": "Hate Your Obamacare Deductible- The GOP Bill Would Make It Even Bigger-", "content": "President Donald Trump and other Republican critics of the Affordable Care Act frequently bemoan that insurance policies sold under the health care law carry massive deductibles that means they have poor value for consumers.\nAnd they have a point. Under Obamacare, deductibles \u2015 the amount of money you have to spend up front before your insurance benefits kick in \u2015 are much higher on average than the deductibles found in job-based health plans, and can be more than $10,000 for families with the least expensive policies. And deductibles have grown since the law\u2019s health insurance regulations and exchange marketplaces went online for the first sign-up period in 2013.\nYet the legislation Republicans are pushing to \u201creplace\u201d the Affordable Care Act would worsen this problem, not solve it. And if GOP leaders get their way and Trump signs the new bill into law, consumers will see that for themselves. This is just one of the many empty promises Republicans have made on health care.\nWhat\u2019s more, high-deductible health plans have been conservatives\u2019 proposed solution to reducing health care costs for more than a decade, so Trump and others blasting the ACA for high deductibles are rejecting their own ideas \u2015 and a key part of their own health care reform bill.\nAt a listening session\u00a0on Monday with individuals the White House dubbed \u201cvictims\u201d of the Affordable Care Act, Trump responded to a woman whose family plan has a $6,500 deductible by saying, \u201cIt\u2019s really not having insurance at all.\u201d\n\u201cYou hear these stories where they\u2019re paying a fortune for insurance, and then you hear how high their deductible is. And unless they have a tragedy in their family, they\u2019re never going to be able to use it,\u201d Trump said.\nRepublicans cite these deductibles as evidence to justify their aggressive, if shaky, push to repeal the Affordable Care Act and enact the American Health Care Act, legislation conceived by House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and endorsed by the president. Supporters of this bill claim it will lower costs for insurance consumers. \nThe Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation, meanwhile, expect the Republican health care bill will lead to 24 million additional uninsured people within a decade and result in higher costs for older and poorer people.\nBut the biggest problem with the GOP talking point about deductibles under the Affordable Care Act is the CBO and JCT\u2019s conclusion that Republicans\u2019\u00a0own bill will actually\u00a0increase deductibles and other forms of out-of-pocket costs.\n\u201cIndividuals\u2019 cost-sharing payments, including deductibles, in the nongroup market would tend to be higher than those anticipated under current law,\u201d the congressional scorekeepers reported Monday. \nThat\u2019s because the Republican bill would permit health insurance companies to go back to selling plans that cover a smaller share of a typical person\u2019s medical expenses. The Affordable Care Act mandates that policies cover at least 60 percent of medical costs. \nThe GOP\u2019s proposed replacement tosses out that rule, meaning health insurance may go back to selling skimpy plans that expose consumers to higher out-of-pocket costs, including deductibles.\u00a0Monthly premiums may be lower, but that\u2019s a reflection of their plans\u2019 meagerness compared to Affordable Care Act plans.\nThe CBO projects that monthly premiums under the GOP proposal will eventually be 10 percent lower than under the Affordable Care Act \u2015 after an initial spike in prices \u2015 but attributes that mainly to the policies being less generous and to the fact that older, sicker people won\u2019t be able to afford them and will\u00a0drop out of the insurance pool\u00a0altogether.\nNaturally, poor people would be hit the hardest. The Affordable Care Act includes special subsidies that substantially reduce deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs for the lowest-income enrollees. The Republican bill does away with those. \nThe CBO and JCT project this obvious outcome: \u201cLower-income people\u2019s share of medical services paid in the form of deductibles and other cost sharing would increase. As a result ... fewer lower-income people would obtain coverage through the nongroup market under the legislation than under current law.\u201d\nMoreover, the American Health Care Act is a vehicle for Republicans\u2019 long-held aim to transform the health insurance market into one in which patients have \u201cskin in the game,\u201d meaning they are responsible for paying more of their medical costs out of pocket. \nSo-called consumer-directed health plans have very high deductibles paired with health savings accounts, which allow people to sock away money tax-free for health care expenses, assuming they have spare money to set aside.\nThe idea is that patients will shop around for lower-priced medical procedures, prescription drugs and the like, ultimately forcing costs down.\n\u201cWhat health savings accounts does, is it helps hardworking taxpayers get access to affordable solutions to help them pay for their out-of-pocket costs, but it\u2019s also their skin in the game, their money,\u201d Ryan said during a news conference last week. \n\u201cIf they save money by saying to a hospital or a doctor or a health care provider, \u2018What is this going to cost me? Where\u2019s the best value for my money?\u2019 If we can bring that consumer pressure to bear in health care, we can dramatically enlist the support of millions of Americans to help us fix this health care problem,\u201d Ryan said.\nThere is evidence that the proliferation of high-deductible health plans in job-based insurance and Affordable Care Act plans has contributed to a\u00a0historic slowdown in national health care spending in recent years. \nBut there\u2019s also evidence that this is because people simply go without medical care they need because they can\u2019t afford it, not because shopping around is driving down prices.\nSign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.
