{"title": "Mike Pompeo, a Hawk Who Pleased the President, Moves From Spying to Diplomacy", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 In 13 months as C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo sometimes displayed the aggressive partisanship he had developed as a Republican combatant in Congress, disturbing some colleagues with hawkish policy pronouncements and political spin that were jarring in his role as intelligence adviser.\nBut the agency appreciated his clout at the White House. His tough talk and stellar r\u00e9sum\u00e9 as a graduate of West Point and Harvard Law School pleased President Trump, who formed a close bond and easy rapport with Mr. Pompeo in daily intelligence briefings.\nNow, if confirmed to replace Rex W. Tillerson as secretary of state, Mr. Pompeo, a 54-year-old former Kansas congressman, would become the first person to have served as both the United States\u2019 top spy and top diplomat. In the new job, Mr. Pompeo would no longer be constrained by the strictures of impartial intelligence analysis, a development likely to thrill his conservative political allies and alarm his critics.\n\u201cMike allowed his public speeches to be more infused with policy than is traditional for a C.I.A. director,\u201d said Michael V. Hayden, who served as C.I.A. director from 2006 to 2009. \u201cBut the agency was very pleased that he was so close to the president. And I\u2019ve heard no one say that he\u2019s made the agency skew its analysis to make the White House happy.\u201d\nMr. Hayden said Mr. Pompeo \u201chas shown that he sounds and thinks more like the president than Tillerson ever did.\u201d\n\u201cThat should make the relationship better,\u201d he said.\nMr. Tillerson \u201cacted as a counterbalance to the president\u2019s spontaneous reaction to things,\u201d Mr. Hayden said, a role that he suggested Mr. Pompeo would be less likely to play.\nAmy Zegart, a Stanford scholar who studies the intelligence agencies, said Mr. Pompeo, who has largely filled major jobs with C.I.A. veterans rather than outsiders, has protected the agency in a tumultuous time, a significant achievement given the fact that Mr. Trump came into office blasting the agency\u2019s competence and reliability.\n\u201cPresident Trump came into office knowing nothing and trusting nothing about the C.I.A.,\u201d she said. \u201cPompeo has gained the president\u2019s trust and for the most part kept the Trump circus out of Langley. That\u2019s a big deal.\u201d\nMr. Pompeo, who was elected to Congress in 2010 in the Tea Party wave, has been especially outspoken on Iran. He shares Mr. Trump\u2019s view that the nuclear agreement with Tehran is deeply flawed. Shortly after Mr. Trump was elected, Mr. Pompeo wrote on Twitter, \u201cI look forward to rolling back this disastrous deal with the world\u2019s largest state sponsor of terrorism.\u201d\nHe has not moderated his messaging at the C.I.A. Five months ago, he called Iran a \u201cdespotic theocracy\u201d and \u201ca pernicious empire that is expanding its power and influence across the Middle East.\u201d\nIn October, he slipped up in discussing the volatile issue of Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election, claiming that American intelligence agencies had concluded that the meddling did not affect the outcome. In fact, the agencies did not give an opinion on the effect of the Russian hacking, leaking and propaganda. The agency issued a corrective statement and Mr. Pompeo has not repeated the mistake.\nDuring Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, Mr. Pompeo publicly welcomed WikiLeaks\u2019 release of Democratic emails hacked and leaked by Russia. But at the C.I.A., he has denounced the group, which published secret documents on the agency\u2019s hacking last year, as \u201ca nonstate hostile intelligence service.\u201d\nHe has had to juggle some political grenades. When Mr. Trump learned that some American intelligence retirees doubted the evidence that Russia was behind the 2016 hacking, he asked Mr. Pompeo to meet with William E. Binney, a National Security Agency veteran who has championed alternative theories.\nThat put the C.I.A. director in an awkward spot because the agency had helped gather the evidence pointing at Russia. The two men had a polite meeting, but Mr. Pompeo did not change his view that Russia was responsible.\nRepresentative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, called his former House colleague \u201chard-working and intelligent and willing to hear different points of view.\u201d But he added a cautionary note, saying Mr. Pompeo \u201chas not always been willing to stand up to the president, particularly when Trump has questioned the intelligence community\u2019s conclusions on Russia, and we will need the new secretary to be willing to speak hard truths to the president.\u201d\nOn covert action, though the details of most operations remain secret, Mr. Pompeo has taken an aggressive approach. In Afghanistan, the agency has sent small teams of highly experienced officers and contractors alongside Afghan troops to hunt and kill Taliban militants across the country. This marks a shift for the C.I.A. in Afghanistan, where the agency had primarily focused on Al Qaeda and on helping the Afghan spy services.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t perform our mission if we\u2019re not aggressive,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said last fall in a speech in Texas. \u201cThis is unforgiving, relentless. You pick the word. Every minute, we have to be focused on crushing our enemies.\u201d\nMr. Pompeo, who served as a tank commander in the Army in Germany and founded an aerospace company, would be one of the most conservative secretaries of state in history. He was an outspoken critic of Hillary Clinton on her handling of the terrorist attack on the American diplomatic facility in Benghazi, Libya, and co-wrote an addendum to the House Benghazi committee\u2019s report because he felt it did not go far enough. He has said that Edward J. Snowden, who gave an archive of secret National Security Agency documents to journalists, should get the death penalty.\nMr. Pompeo brought a taste of America\u2019s domestic culture wars into the agency, laying plans to hire chaplains for the agency, which until now has typically treated religion as a private matter. Officials said that the idea originated during a breakfast Mr. Pompeo had at the C.I.A. with Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council, a conservative advocacy group that opposes gay rights, abortion and even divorce \u2014 a common hazard for C.I.A. officers working in operations overseas.\nHis hard line against jihadist terrorism has sometimes spilled over into condemnation of Muslims more broadly, as in 2013, when he said American Muslim leaders had not been sufficiently outspoken in denouncing the Boston Marathon bombing, making them \u201cpotentially complicit in these acts.\u201d\nSuch statements outraged groups like Muslim Advocates, which urged the Senate on Tuesday not to confirm Mr. Pompeo, whom it said had \u201cmade a career of bigotry and hate.\u201d\nA longtime beneficiary of conservative superdonors Charles G. and David H. Koch, whose oil and chemical company, Koch Industries, is based in Mr. Pompeo\u2019s former district, Mr. Pompeo repeatedly attacked the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to battle climate change. He opposed the Paris climate agreement and has been publicly skeptical that human activities are largely responsible for the atmosphere\u2019s warming, though he has not tried to block the intelligence agencies\u2019 finding that climate change contributes to security threats.\nSenator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas and a close friend of Mr. Pompeo\u2019s who traveled abroad with him both when he was in Congress and while he has been at the C.I.A., said that despite his sometimes harsh language and strong views, Mr. Pompeo is a good choice for the State Department.\n\u201cMike consistently in our foreign travels has been diplomatic but firm,\u201d Mr. Cotton said. \u201cHe won\u2019t dodge hard issues, but he won\u2019t needlessly antagonize people.\u201d", "date": "March 13, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/13/us/politics/pompeo-cia-trump-secretary-of-state.html", "tags": "intelligence diplomacy president agency \u201d hawk pleased pompeo c.i.a spying mike moves"}
