{"title": "Mika Brzezinski Calls Out Boston Red Sox Players Who Visited Donald Trump", "content": "Mika Brzezinski on Friday criticized the Boston Red Sox players who didn\u2019t\u00a0boycott President Donald Trump\u2019s White House celebration of the team\u2019s World Series victory.\nManager Alex Cora and nearly all of the MLB team\u2019s players of color protested the Trump administration, refusing to attend the celebration of the championship with the president on Thursday.\u00a0Every white player on the team \u2014 as well as outfielder J.D. Martinez, who is of Cuban descent \u2014 attended.\n\u201cWhy would anybody on that team go?\u201d asked Brzezinski, co-host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t get it. Isn\u2019t it all about unity?\u201d\u00a0\nMSNBC contributor Donny Deutsch argued that players shouldn\u2019t be denied the opportunity to attend the event.\nBut Brzezinski fired back:\nJoe Scarborough, Brzezinski\u2019s co-host, husband, and also a Red Sox fan, acknowledged there were \u201csome difficult parts in this, really.\u201d\nHe noted how hard it would be to tell a young player who may never get to visit the White House again \u201cthat you\u2019ve got to make a political statement even if you don\u2019t follow politics.\u201d\nBut \u201cit\u2019s about the unit, it\u2019s about the team,\u201d said Scarborough.\n\u201cIt works both ways though,\u201d he added, as he rhetorically asked if there was \u201cnot one white guy on that team\u201d who couldn\u2019t have stayed back with his teammates of color who were \u201cuncomfortable\u201d with the presidential celebration.\n\u201cCome on, this is the most racist president, certainly, in our lifetime,\u201d Scarborough said.\u00a0\u201cYou can talk about Charlottesville, can you talk about what he said about Hispanics, what he said about Puerto Ricans. He\u2019s called Hispanics breeders. He\u2019s attacked immigrants.\u201d\nCNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo and Don Lemon also discussed the Red Sox stars\u2019 boycott on Thursday night.\nCuomo said he wouldn\u2019t have attended the event because \u201cI\u2019m a team guy\u201d and \u201cI believe in that idea of unity.\u201d\u00a0\nLemon agreed, adding that \u201ceven when you have an opportunity to go to the White House ... you gotta stick with your team.\u201d\n\u201cSome behavior, you just cannot stand for,\u201d Lemon added.", "date": "\n05/10/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mika-brzezinski-boston-red-sox-white-house-visit_n_5cd569fbe4b054da4e878df2", "tags": "calls brzezinski red visited team boston trump players \u201d mika donald white sox"}
