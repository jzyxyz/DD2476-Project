{"title": "Merkel Rejects U.S. Demands That Europe Pull Out of Iran Nuclear Deal", "content": "MUNICH \u2014 Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany delivered a strong rejoinder on Saturday to American demands that European allies pull out of the Iran nuclear deal and gave a spirited defense of multilateral institutions in a world increasingly marked by great-power rivalry.\nIn an uncharacteristically passionate speech, Ms. Merkel said the nuclear deal was the best way of influencing Iranian behavior on a range of non-nuclear issues, from missile development to terrorism.\nWithout mentioning President Trump or the United States by name in what may be her last speech to this major security conference, Ms. Merkel criticized other unilateral moves, such as Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to pull American troops out of Syria, a suggestion that he would withdraw quickly from Afghanistan and his decision to suspend the Intermediate Range Missile Treaty with Russia, which directly affects European security.\n\u201cWe sit there in the middle with the result,\u201d she said.\nMs. Merkel spoke immediately before the United States vice president, Mike Pence, and addressed a packed auditorium with an audience that included Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka, as well as the Russian foreign minister and a high-ranking Chinese official, who all pointedly remained seated when the chancellor received a standing ovation.\nHer reception was in sharp contrast to the polite near-silence that greeted Mr. Pence\u2019s address. Aware of a growing anxiety among European allies that the United States administration\u2019s erratic leadership stance was a threat to their security, the vice president came to Munich laser-focused on the Trump administration\u2019s message.\nHe repeated his demand from this past week in Warsaw that Germany, France and Britain should join Washington in pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal.\n\u201cThe time has come for the Europeans to leave the Iranian nuclear deal,\u201d Mr. Pence said.\nIn contrast to the chancellor, Mr. Pence focused less on working together and more on a list of demands for American allies based on American interests, with a heavy emphasis on a combative approach to Iran.\n\u201cThe Iranian regime openly advocates another Holocaust, and it seeks the means to achieve it,\u201d Mr. Pence said.\nThe two speeches were a reminder of how far apart Europe and the United States are on a range of global issues.\nMs. Merkel said the split over Iran \u201cdepresses me very much,\u201d but she stressed that Europe and America were ultimately pursuing the same goal since Europe, too, was concerned about Iranian behavior.\n\u201cI see the ballistic missile program, I see Iran in Yemen, and above all I see Iran in Syria,\u201d Ms. Merkel said.\nShe added: \u201cThe only question that stands between us on this issue is, do we help our common cause, our common aim of containing the damaging or difficult development of Iran, by withdrawing from the one remaining agreement? Or do we help it more by keeping the small anchor we have in order maybe to exert pressure in other areas?\u201d\nMs. Merkel defended multilateralism and stressed that collective solutions were the only way to tackle global challenges \u2014 from a rising China to climate change to mutually beneficial trade.\nThe chancellor also challenged the United States on its decision to pull put of Syria, asking, \u201cIs that not also strengthening the possibilities for Iran and Russia to exert influence there?\u201d\nOne main issue of disagreement between Berlin and Washington \u2014 as well as Poland and the Baltic States \u2014 is the Nordstream 2 pipeline that would send Russian gas to Germany while bypassing Ukraine.\nMr. Pence accused Germany again of putting its own interests ahead of its neighbors\u2019 and of giving Russia a possible tool to pressure the West.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t ensure the defense of the West if our allies are dependent on the East,\u201d he said.\nIn her speech, Ms. Merkel said that Europe was buying Russian gas anyway, even if it arrived through a Ukrainian pipeline. Even during the Cold War, she said, \u201cwe imported large amounts of Russian gas. I don\u2019t know why times should be so much worse today.\u201d\n\u201cDo we want to make Russia only dependent on China? Is that our European interest?\u201d she asked. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d\nMr. Pence, for his part, said that the United States was committed to NATO, and he praised Mr. Trump for pushing allies to spend more on defense, for standing up to China and North Korea and for showing renewed American leadership in the world.\nAfter both leaders had spoken, many observers came away struck by the difference in tone and reception.\n\u201cIn contrast to Merkel\u2019s visionary outward-looking speech that triggered warm applause, Mr. Pence delivered a stilted defense of Trump\u2019s achievements to a skeptical audience,\u201d said Amanda Sloat, a scholar with the Brookings Institution in Washington and a former official in the Obama administration.\nMs. Merkel even mocked the idea that German cars could be considered a \u201cnational security threat\u201d by the United States, as American trade officials have asserted.\n\u201cIf that is viewed as a security threat by the United States,\u201d she said, \u201cwe are shocked.\u201d\nDeclaring that BMW\u2019s largest plant was now not in Bavaria but in South Carolina, she added, \u201cWe are proud of our cars, and so we should be.\u201d", "date": "Feb. 16, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/16/world/europe/merkel-speech-munich.html", "tags": "iran merkel pull nuclear u.s. united states pence \u201d europe ms. rejects demands deal"}
