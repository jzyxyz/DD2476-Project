{"title": "The Russia Investigation Is Complicated. Here\u2019s What It All Means.", "content": "The basics\nthe major focuses of the investigation \nMr. Mueller is investigating Russia\u2019s efforts to influence the presidential race and sow discord by spreading inflammatory messages on social media and stealing emails from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman and the Democratic National Committee, which were then strategically released to undermine the Clinton campaign. \nInvestigators are examining what Mr. Trump\u2019s aides and associates knew about Russia\u2019s meddling, particularly the release of thousands of stolen Democratic emails, and whether any of them aided Moscow\u2019s effort. \nMr. Mueller is investigating an array of the president\u2019s actions \u2014 including the firing of the former F.B.I. director, James B. Comey \u2014 to determine whether Mr. Trump sought to impede the investigation into Russia\u2019s actions.\nMr. Mueller is investigating whether Trump associates ran afoul of American lobbying or anti-corruption laws. Two aides to the Trump campaign, including its onetime chairman, were charged with financial crimes related to their work as advisers to a pro-Russia former president of Ukraine.\n\u2014 Michael S. Schmidt\ninvestigation results \nKey events\nRussia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in March 2014 prompted international ire, and the United States responded by imposing sanctions and taking other steps designed to isolate Moscow on the world stage.\nOut to restore its own influence, Russia sought to undermine the United States, taking aim at its vulnerabilities \u2014 namely domestic political polarization. As early as April 2014, a friend of President Vladimir V. Putin began an operation that included setting up a troll farm to create fake social media posts and sending operatives to the United States to gather intelligence on the political process. The stated goal: \u201cspread distrust towards the candidates and the political system in general.\u201d \nAmerican officials have traced other elements of Russia\u2019s interference, notably the hacking and leaking of Democratic emails, to Russian intelligence agencies carrying out Mr. Putin\u2019s orders. \nDonald J. Trump announced his campaign for president.\nAs he closed in on a stunning victory in the Republican primary, Mr. Trump met in Washington with his foreign policy advisers. One, George Papadopoulos, told the group that he had connections to help arrange a meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin. Others at the meeting noted that Russia was under sanctions. Mr. Sessions, then a senator from Alabama and a top Trump campaign adviser, quickly shut down the subject and said it should not be discussed again, a former campaign official has said. That conversation fits into the purview of Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation.\nA London-based professor with ties to the Russian government informed Mr. Papadopoulos that the Russians had thousands of emails that would embarrass Mrs. Clinton. \nDonald Trump Jr. and top campaign officials met with Natalia V. Veselnitskaya, a Russian lawyer, at Trump Tower to discuss what an intermediary promised to be incriminating information about Mrs. Clinton. Paul Manafort, the campaign chairman, and Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, were among those also at the meeting, where Ms. Veselnitskaya complained about American sanctions on Russia. The special counsel is investigating.\nCrowdstrike, a cybersecurity firm hired by the Democratic National Committee, announced that it had expelled two Russian hacker groups \u2014 called Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear \u2014 that had penetrated the D.N.C.\u2019s systems. The groups had gained access to thousands of emails and confidential documents. Just over a month later, WikiLeaks released nearly 20,000 hacked Democratic emails. \nIn light of existing ties between four campaign aides and Moscow, the F.B.I. opened its investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s links to Russia.\nMr. Trump won the presidential election, defeating Hillary Clinton in an extraordinary upset.\nThen-President Barack Obama announced sanctions against Russia, citing its attempts to interfere with the presidential election. That day, Michael T. Flynn, in line to be Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, discussed the sanctions with the Russian ambassador to the United States. He later pleaded guilty to lying to investigators about the conversations, which undermined existing American policy and flouted a warning from a senior Obama administration official to stop meddling in foreign affairs before the inauguration. \nMr. Trump was inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States.\nMr. Flynn resigned as national security adviser following revelations that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence and other top officials about his conversations in December with the Russian ambassador. The F.B.I. had also asked him about those calls.  \nIn the Oval Office, President Trump privately asked Mr. Comey, the F.B.I. director, to shut down the investigation into Mr. Flynn. \n\u201cI hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go,\u201d Mr. Trump said, according to a memo Mr. Comey wrote. \u201cHe is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.\u201d Mr. Mueller is investigating the episode as he examines whether the president tried to obstruct the inquiry itself.\nCiting his role as a top Trump campaign adviser and under scrutiny over meetings he had with Russians, Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from all campaign-related matters at the Justice Department, including the Russia investigation. Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, later became the top Justice Department official overseeing the Russia inquiry.\nMr. Trump fired Mr. Comey as the F.B.I. director. Initially, he cited his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails, but later gave varying rationales, saying at one point that the Russia allegations were a \u201cmade-up story.\u201d   \nOne day later, Mr. Trump told Russian officials whom he was hosting in the Oval Office that firing Mr. Comey had relieved \u201cgreat pressure\u201d on him.\n\u201cI just fired the head of the F.B.I. He was crazy, a real nut job,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI faced great pressure because of Russia. That\u2019s taken off.\u201d Mr. Comey\u2019s firing is also a subject of Mr. Mueller\u2019s obstruction inquiry.\nMr. Rosenstein appointed Mr. Mueller, the former F.B.I. director, to serve as special counsel and oversee the investigation. \nMr. Papadopoulos was charged with lying to the F.B.I. and signed a plea deal two days later. He began cooperating with the investigation. \nMr. Manafort and Rick Gates, his business associate and the deputy campaign chairman, surrendered to the authorities and pleaded not guilty to charges including money laundering and tax fraud.\nMr. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to investigators and said he had agreed to cooperate with the special counsel.\nThirteen Russians and three companies were charged in a sprawling indictment. Federal prosecutors accused the Russians of stealing the identities of American citizens, posing as political activists and using the flash points of immigration, religion and race to manipulate a campaign in which those issues were already particularly divisive.  \nMr. Gates changed his plea to guilty, admitting that he lied to federal investigators and committed financial fraud, and began cooperating with the special counsel. \nF.B.I. agents raided the hotel and office of Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer and fixer, based on a referral from the special counsel. \nWho\u2019s Who\nTRUMP, Donald J., Republican candidate for president, later 45th president of the United StatesDonald J.
