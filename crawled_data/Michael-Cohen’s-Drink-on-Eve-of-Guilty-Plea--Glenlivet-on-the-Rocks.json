{"title": "Michael Cohen\u2019s Drink on Eve of Guilty Plea: Glenlivet on the Rocks", "content": "Michael D. Cohen sat silently in a Manhattan courtroom on Tuesday as a judge ran through a list of questions typically asked of defendants before they plead guilty.\nHad he been under a doctor\u2019s care? Had he ever been hospitalized for mental illness or addiction?\nNo, Mr. Cohen replied each time.\nBut when the judge asked whether he had had any medication or alcohol in the last 24 hours \u2014 \u201cWhat have you taken or consumed, sir?\u201d \u2014 Mr. Cohen responded affirmatively.\n\u201cLast night at dinner, I had a glass of Glenlivet 12 on the rocks,\u201d Mr. Cohen said, drawing laughs from the spectator gallery. It was not his usual custom to do that, he added.\nThe exchange was the only moment of levity in an otherwise tense and somber hearing at which Mr. Cohen, President Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer and fixer, pleaded guilty to breaking tax and campaign finance laws, and made stunning admissions about helping Mr. Trump buy the silence of two women about affairs they said they had with him.\nMr. Cohen\u2019s sunken eyes loomed as dark as his charcoal suit. After he took his seat, he moved his head side-to-side and he clasped his hands, which seemed to be trembling. He sighed deeply. He reviewed documents given to him by his lawyers, and at one point lifted a hand over his mouth.\nAfter the hearing began, Mr. Cohen responded calmly to questions from the judge, William H. Pauley III, often with a lawyer\u2019s precision and self-assurance. Asked his age, he answered, \u201cIn four days, I\u2019ll be 52.\u201d\nAnd when he was asked later whether he knew his false statements to a financial institution were untrue when he made them, he answered with legalese.\n\u201cThey were omitted, your honor, as opposed to being false,\u201d Mr. Cohen said.\nWhen the judge pressed him \u2014 \u201cWell, you knew it was false; that it falsely depicted your financial condition, didn\u2019t you?\u201d \u2014 Mr. Cohen acquiesced, saying, \u201cYes, your honor.\u201d\nThroughout the hearing, Mr. Cohen maintained a look of grim resignation, pursing his lips and nodding slightly when the judge advised him of his rights.\nAfter one question, he paused and his voice almost seemed to disappear.\n\u201cDo you understand,\u201d Judge Pauley asked, \u201cthat you can change your mind right now and refuse to enter a plea of guilty?\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Mr. Cohen responded, in a voice far reduced from its normal bold tenor.\nWhen Judge Pauley also asked Mr. Cohen if he understood that he could face as many as 65 years in prison, Mr. Cohen\u2019s voice began to crack, and he appeared to fight back tears.\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Mr. Cohen said softly.\nJudge Pauley, appointed to the federal bench in 1998 by President Bill Clinton, was randomly assigned to Mr. Cohen\u2019s case. He scheduled Mr. Cohen\u2019s sentencing for Dec. 12.\nAs the hearing ended and the courtroom began to empty, Mr. Cohen stood quietly with his lawyers, Guy Petrillo and Amy Lester; Ms. Lester patted him gently on his left shoulder. They left without offering any comment, and soon Mr. Cohen was walking to a waiting black Buick on Worth Street.\nThis scene played out before scores of reporters and camera crews enclosed behind police barricades. There was also a crowd of onlookers, some of whom wore shirts with slogans like \u201ctreason\u201d and \u201cMueller Time.\u201d Hecklers shouted \u201cguil-ty! guil-ty!\u201d and \u201clock him up!\u201d\nAfter Robert S. Khuzami, the deputy United States attorney, made a short statement outside the courthouse, one woman shouted, \u201cThank you!\u201d and some onlookers applauded.", "date": "Aug. 21, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/nyregion/michael-cohen-guilty-glenlivet-trump.html", "tags": "hearing guilty \u201c judge plea cohen rocks asked pauley michael eve \u2014 glenlivet drink"}
