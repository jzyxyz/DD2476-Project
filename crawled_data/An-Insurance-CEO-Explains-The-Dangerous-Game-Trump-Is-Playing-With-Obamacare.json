{"title": "An Insurance CEO Explains The Dangerous Game Trump Is Playing With Obamacare", "content": "President Donald Trump has been threatening to stop making payments to health insurance companies that cover low-income people under Obamacare. Doing so would seriously jeopardize the entire insurance market in ways that could be felt immediately by poor households and the insurers that provide their health benefits.\nAlthough the Trump administration\u00a0said on Wednesday\u00a0it wouldn\u2019t cut off these funds \u2015 called cost-sharing reduction payments or CSRs \u2015 immediately, the president still sees them as a cudgel to use against Democrats in Congress. Trump believes the public will blame the party that created Obamacare if he seriously damages the health insurance system, rather than him and his Republican Party.\nIt\u2019s an enormously complex policy and business issue with the potential for devastating consequences. \nThe problem dates back three years to a lawsuit House Republicans filed against President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, challenging the legality of the way the federal government paid insurers with low-income customers. Last year, Obama lost that lawsuit and appealed, and the funding remains in jeopardy because Congress hasn\u2019t authorized the spending in the meantime. More than 7 million people \u2015 58 percent of Obamacare enrollees \u2015 received these subsidies this year.\nTo help readers better understand what this all means and why it matters, HuffPost interviewed Mario Molina, a physician and the CEO of Molina Healthcare, an insurance company that has\u00a0more than 1 million customers in nine states\u00a0with policies from the Affordable Care Act\u2019s exchanges. The following is a transcript of that conversation.\nThis stuff is complicated. Can you to explain to a layperson what these cost-sharing reduction payments are and why they\u2019re important?\nMolina: The cost-sharing reductions are payments that are made to health plans to help cover copays and deductibles for low-income patients who get their health insurance through the exchange. And the way it works is that, let\u2019s say you have a $50 copay. Depending on your income, it may be reduced to $15 with the health plan picking up the balance, which then gets paid to the doctor or the provider that you\u2019re seeing. \nThe plan is paid by the government, and then any money that is not used for copays and deductibles we must then return. So it\u2019s really not a premium payment so much as it is a reimbursement for subsidies that reduce the out-of-pocket costs to the insured individual.\nWhy are we talking about this? What\u2019s the problem right now? Why is there a question about whether these payments are going to be made?\nThe first issue is that many people with low-to-moderate incomes rely on these to help make their insurance more affordable. One of the things that Americans have complained about is the high cost of the copays and deductibles in this program. So this is designed to help them to be able to access doctors in a way that\u2019s more affordable. \nThe reason that we\u2019re talking about it and why the funding is in question is that there\u2019s an argument between the administration \u2015 the Obama administration, it started out with \u2015 and the Republicans in Congress as to how it would be paid for. The Obama administration felt that it was built into their budget. Congress thought that it was not. So there\u2019s a fight. \nIt\u2019s a little bit like if I hired someone to paint my house, and then my wife and I argued about who\u2019s going to write the check: Is it coming out of my account or her account? We still owe the painter the money. He did the work. But we\u2019re arguing about whose bank account this is going to come out of. That\u2019s the issue right now. \nSo we\u2019re looking for Congress to acknowledge that they\u2019re going to pay for it and to fund the program. Right now, the administration continues to pay for it while this is in dispute.\nWhat happens immediately if the administration halts these payments or drops the appeal of the lawsuit that the previous administration lost on this question?\nMany people in the insurance industry believe that if the government doesn\u2019t fund this and doesn\u2019t pay the insurance plans, that they will have breached their contract with the insurance plans, and this could result in millions of Americans losing their insurance coverage this year.\nWhat are the bigger, longer-term implications for the entire individual health insurance market \u2015 both for the exchanges and people who buy directly \u2015 if these payments go away, starting with 2018\u2019s market?\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation has estimated that, without these cost-sharing reductions, premiums will rise by an average of about 20 percent. [Note: The estimate\u00a0is 19 percent.]\u00a0So health care will be more expensive in 2018, and many of the insurance companies will drop out because of the uncertainty about the program. Beneficiaries or people seeking insurance could find fewer choices, higher costs \u2015 all because Congress did not fund the program.\nHow is your company preparing for these eventualities in this climate of uncertainty for what you may do next year, and are there ways the end of these payments would affect Molina differently from other health insurance companies?\nWhat we\u2019re doing to prepare for next year is to develop our premium rates. And we really have to look at this two ways. One is if the CSR is funded and one if it is not. The second question is: Do we even stay in the program at all? And if they\u2019re not funded for 2017, I imagine that we\u2019ll drop out of the program altogether. \nIt affects all companies, some maybe to a greater extent than others, depending on how many of your members are getting these subsidies. For us, it\u2019s over 70 percent. For some companies, it may be as high as 90 percent. So, the greater the percentage of your members who get these subsidies, the bigger the impact it will be on your health plan. And for us, we simply couldn\u2019t sustain the losses. For us, it would be losses of hundreds of millions of dollars without these payments.\nAt this moment, what is your message to the administration and to the Congress about what they should do and when?\nMy advice to the president and to the Congress is that they should fund the CSRs, which they\u2019re currently paying anyway, for 2017 and 2018 to create stability in the individual insurance market. This will allow them time to come up with some rational changes to the Affordable Care Act to make it more sustainable for the long term. What they really need to do, though, is to buy themselves some time and some stability to have a bipartisan debate about what should be done about the insurance market in the United States. \nWhat happens next, and what will you be looking for in the very near term, in the coming weeks or couple of months?\nMolina: In the coming weeks, I think the most important priority is to fund these cost-sharing reductions to make sure that people who rely on them continue to have access to health insurance. \nLonger term, I think that the country needs to address the high cost of health care, which is what drives the high cost of insurance. We often hear that the ACA and the individual market is failing. It\u2019s not. And if the funding continues, I think that it will do well in 2017 and 2018. But Congress needs to ensure that the funding is there.\nThis transcript has been edited for clarity.\n Politics hurt too much?
