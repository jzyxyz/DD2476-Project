{"title": "Hungary\u2019s Leader Was Shunned by Obama, but Has a Friend in Trump", "content": "BUDAPEST \u2014 Across rural Hungary, Prime Minister Viktor Orban dominates the media landscape. His allies control the major regional newspapers, which provide supportive coverage of Mr. Orban\u2019s anti-immigrant agenda and his methodical erosion of the country\u2019s democratic checks and balances. Critical, independent outlets are mostly absent.\nBut last November, that looked set to change, if modestly, as the State Department announced a $700,000 grant to help nurture independent media outlets in rural Hungary. To the State Department, the grant would continue a longstanding American effort to promote free speech. To the Orban administration, it was another provocation from the United States, a country that had treated the prime minister like a pariah since 2012.\nFinalists for the grant were identified. But then, unexpectedly, the selection of a recipient was deferred in July, and the State Department announced that the money might instead be used in other parts of Europe.\n\u201cA huge victory,\u201d declared Andras Simonyi, Mr. Orban\u2019s former envoy to NATO, and later the Hungarian ambassador to Washington. \u201cThis sends a message that Hungary is O.K., that Hungary is a democracy.\u201d\nFor years, Mr. Orban\u2019s government has craved validation from Washington, spending millions of dollars on lobbying, mostly in vain. The Obama administration largely ostracized Mr. Orban, avoiding high-level, bilateral contacts as punishment for his creeping authoritarian tendencies. American diplomats criticized Mr. Orban\u2019s crackdown on civil society \u2014 as did President Barack Obama himself.\nBut now the Trump administration is pivoting, signaling a new engagement with Hungary, as well as nearby Poland. The shift has alarmed many campaigners for democracy and the rule of law, even as others argue that the Obama strategy of trying to isolate Mr. Orban had failed, and created openings for Russian and Chinese influence.\nPresident Trump has made no secret of his fondness for strongman leaders, yet his praise for them has sometimes been out of step with the policies of his administration. Toward Mr. Orban, at least, American policy seems to be following Mr. Trump\u2019s lead.\n\u201cPresident Trump thinks that he is a very strong leader,\u201d David B. Cornstein, a longtime friend of Mr. Trump\u2019s who became the United States ambassador to Budapest in June, said in an interview. \u201cAnd our president admires strong leaders, and looks forward to this relationship going forward.\u201d\nTo some European diplomats and analysts, Mr. Trump\u2019s pivot in Hungary deepens their belief that his administration is trying to divide the European Union, a bloc that he regards as a powerful trade competitor. Mr. Trump has frequently criticized the union, even describing it as a trade \u201cfoe,\u201d while praising the Continent\u2019s insurgent, populist forces. His former senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon is trying to create a Europe-wide alliance of far-right politicians ahead of European Parliament elections next year, and his new ambassador to Germany, Richard A. Grenell, has said he hopes to empower conservative forces across the Continent.\n\u201cI think they\u2019re using Hungary like they\u2019re using other countries in Europe with nationalist leaderships \u2014 to divide the European Union,\u201d said Jiri Pehe, the chief of cabinet to the Czech president, Vaclav Havel, in the 1990s. \u201cIt is nice that they\u2019re putting up this facade in Washington on their opening with Hungary, saying that this is an effort towards keeping Hungary in the Atlantic alliance \u2014 but this certainly doesn\u2019t contribute to Hungary becoming more Euro-Atlantic.\u201d\n\u201cIt legitimizes Russian influence in Hungary,\u201d added Mr. Pehe, who is now the director of New York University\u2019s campus in Prague.\nWith a program to build what he calls an \u201cilliberal democracy,\u201d Mr. Orban is the most influential populist leader in Europe. He has cultivated ties with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, called for a \u201ccountercultural revolution\u201d inside the European Union, and anointed himself as the protector of Europe\u2019s Christian identity. His critics argue that he has undermined the country\u2019s checks and balances, gerrymandered the electoral map and placed the judiciary under the management of one of his oldest friends.\nThis record is why Mr. Orban struggled for influence in Washington during the Obama years, despite making a real effort. His government donated millions of dollars to dozens of American research groups, cultural foundations, scholarship funds and lobbyists, much of it funneled through the Hungarian Initiatives Foundation, which is registered as a company in Delaware but owned, according to Hungarian law, by Mr. Orban\u2019s office.\nThe Hungarian government has endowed the foundation with $15 million, according to official records. Small donations were made to American foreign policy think tanks, including two payments totaling $20,000 to the Center for European Policy Analysis, a Washington-based group led at the time by A. Wess Mitchell, whom Mr. Trump has since appointed as assistant secretary of state for Europe and Eurasia.\nMr. Orban\u2019s government has also paid more than $2.5 million to Connie Mack IV, a former Republican congressman, to lobby on Hungary\u2019s behalf on Capitol Hill \u2014 including to try to kill the $700,000 media grant. Mr. Mack found little traction among lawmakers, except with a group of 11 Republicans from the Tea Party caucus, including Representative Steve King of Iowa.\nIn January, those 11 lawmakers wrote to  Rex W. Tillerson, the secretary of state at the time, praising Mr. Mitchell\u2019s appointment, demanding the withdrawal of the $700,000 media grant and urging the restoration of high-level diplomatic contacts with Mr. Orban\u2019s government.\nMr. Tillerson appears to have disregarded the letter. But in April, he  was replaced as secretary of state by Mike Pompeo.\nThe next month, the American thaw toward Hungary began. Mr. Pompeo met in Washington with his Hungarian counterpart, Peter Szijjarto, ending a six-year period without high-level bilateral contacts. In June, Mr. Trump spoke by phone with Mr. Orban, a privilege Mr. Obama never granted.\nDays after Mr. Trump\u2019s call, Mr. Mitchell used an appearance at Carnegie Europe to describe the administration\u2019s new approach. He blamed prior policy for the United States \u201closing strategic influence\u201d to Russia and China in many regions of the world, including Central and Eastern Europe. He argued that Washington needed to better balance engagement with \u201cnecessary criticism\u201d in order to keep countries like Hungary in the Western fold.\n\u201cWhat I think won\u2019t work is an approach that would look at a country like Hungary, freeze it out from meetings or access, criticize it publicly for several years, and then expect that somehow we\u2019re going to retain influence,\u201d Mr. Mitchell said.\nNot long afterward, the $700,000 grant for independent media outlets in rural Hungary was deferred.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that the United States or I are not in favor of a free press \u2014 that\u2019s an integral part of democracy that I and we believe in very, very strongly,\u201d said Mr. Cornstein, the ambassador to Budapest, denying that there had been any political motivations behind the decision.\n\u201cWe just felt that it isn\u2019t a Hungarian problem,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s almost a regional problem of the countries in the area.\u201d\nMr. Trump, of course, has been sharply critical of the American news media, repeatedly describing reporters as \u201cthe enemy of the people.\u201d And the pressures on independent news outlets in Hungary are well documented: Not long after the American grant was deferred, a magazine critical of Mr. Orban, Heti Valasz, announced that it would shut down. The private television channel HirTV was taken over by an Orban ally.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you can separate this policy decision from an administration that has clearly downplayed support for human rights and democratic institutions abroad,\u201d said Robert G. Berschinski, who served as deputy assistant secretary of state for democracy and human rights from 2016-17. \u201cThis administration is simply not prioritizing these issues.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cBoth Trump and key officials at the State Department seem willing to give the Hungarian government a pass on its abandonment of liberal democracy, if for slightly differing reasons.\u201d\nYet others disagree, including some critics of Mr. Orban and Mr. Trump. As Mr. Obama\u2019s aggressive tactics failed to rein in Mr. Orban, it was worth trying a more quietist strategy, said Mr. Simonyi, the former Hungarian ambassador to Washington.\n\u201cI want to see the U.S. make a real effort to keep these guys in our Western orbit,\u201d he said. \u201cWe might not like it, a lot of my liberal friends in Budapest might not like it, but it\u2019s got to be done.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cIt\u2019s in Western interests to talk to this guy.\u201d\nSince becoming ambassador to Budapest in June, Mr. Cornstein has defended the Central European University, an American institution in the city that Mr. Orban has tried  to shut down  because of its connections to George Soros, the American-Hungarian financier and philanthropist whom Mr. Orban has portrayed as an enemy of the Hungarian state. Mr. Cornstein promised in an interview to speak out strongly in private if he personally reached the conclusion that the Orban government was a threat to the rule of law.\n\u201cIf you see something is not democratic, something is hurting the Hungarian government and people, you should say something about it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it should be done in private. You don\u2019t voice that opinion first and foremost in the media.\u201d", "date": "Aug. 15, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/15/world/europe/hungary-us-orban-trump.html", "tags": "american \u201c hungary orban trump shunned obama friend leader hungarian state"}
