{"title": "Here's Why Jon Snow Didn't Pet Ghost In His 'Game Of Thrones' Goodbye", "content": "Was\u00a0Jon Snow ghosting Ghost in Season 8 of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d?\nIn Episode 4 on Sunday, Snow\u00a0(Kit Harington) chucks up the deuces to Winterfell as he heads south to bring the Northern army to fight for Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke). He has a number of goodbyes with fam and friends, including Tormund (Kristofer Hivju), Samwell Tarly (John Bradley) and Gilly (Hannah Murray). But when he sees his faithful direwolf\u00a0Ghost, First of His Name, The Goodest of Good Boys, who\u2019s just off to the side looking on, this happens:\u00a0\nYep. Just a little Paws.\nSo what\u2019s going on here? Jon and Ghost definitely had a moment, but didn\u2019t the direwolf just lose an ear fighting the army of the dead for the King in the North? Should it have been more?\nThe scene left fans wondering one thing: Why didn\u2019t Jon just pet Ghost?\nWell, now that mystery has been solved thanks to director David Nutter.\u00a0\n\u201cSince the direwolves are kind of CG creations, we felt it best to keep it as simple as possible,\u201d said Nutter. \u201cAnd I think that it played out much more powerfully that way.\u201d\n\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d visual effects supervisor Joe Bauer previously explained the difficulties of bringing the direwolves to life ahead of Season 8, saying real wolves need to be filmed and scaled up. And unfortunately, those wolves \u201conly behave in certain ways.\u201d\n\u201cKeeping Ghost off to the side, I thought that played out better,\u201d said Nutter, adding that it gave Jon a chance to be with Tormund and Gilly before having one last moment with his wolf.\n\u201cThen he just walks off by himself, he turns to Ghost and has this moment with Ghost that I thought was very, very powerful.\u201d\nThe actors behind Samwell and Tormund, Bradley and Hivju, also reflected on the Ghost moment, agreeing that Jon sending his direwolf north was the right choice to make.\nBradley told HuffPost, \u201cI think that Jon knows what he\u2019s leaving behind. Jon Snow is a noble man, and he knows all about sacrifice ... He knows what he has to keep safe, and he knows he has a responsibility to Ghost and a responsibility to Sam, Gilly and Baby Sam because he knows where they\u2019ll be safe.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cHe was very aware of the sacrifice of leaving those figures behind, and they know \u2014 hopefully, Ghost knows what he means to Jon \u2014 and Jon knows what Ghost means to him.\u201d\nIn another interview, Hivju told our own Leigh Blickley, \u201cI think Jon is right that the south isn\u2019t the place for a direwolf. In Episode 2 or 3 they killed one of them [Lady, Sansa\u2019s direwolf] \u2014 it\u2019s a wild animal, it\u2019s like a wolf plus two! I think it\u2019s best for Ghost to go north.\u201d\nAnd if you\u2019re worried about not seeing more Ghost in the future,\u00a0Hivju is up for that fan-proposed Tormund and Ghost spinoff ... if they make it.\n\u201cWell, there\u2019s still two more episodes to go. We don\u2019t know if they survive.\u201d\nWhat is Ghost may never die.\nLeigh Blickley contributed reporting.", "date": "\n05/06/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/game-of-thrones-jon-snow-ghost_n_5cd04a2ce4b0548b735d884c", "tags": "ghost think goodbye moment tormund pet \u201d direwolf hivju jon knows snow thrones"}
