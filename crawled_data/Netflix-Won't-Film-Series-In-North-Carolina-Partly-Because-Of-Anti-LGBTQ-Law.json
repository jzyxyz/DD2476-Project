Though the coming-of-age drama is set in North Carolina\u2019s Outer Banks (or OBX), producers are opting to film it in South Carolina partly because of the remnants of House Bill 2.\nHB2, signed by former Gov. Pat McCrory (R) in March 2016, prohibited transgender people from using restrooms that align with their gender identities.\u00a0The bill sparked an instant backlash and was condemned by everyone from Hillary Clinton to Bruce Springsteen, who nixed a performance in Greensboro over the legislation.\u00a0\nHB2 was partially repealed and replaced by HB142 in 2017. The replacement, however,\u00a0maintains a provision\u00a0prohibiting municipalities from passing any ordinance regulating private employment or public accommodations.\u00a0In other words, it bars cities from passing their own nondiscrimination protections for LGBTQ people or enacting measures raising the minimum wage or protecting workers.\nAt present,\u00a0this provision will remain in place until 2020.\u00a0\nA Netflix spokeswoman told HuffPost the streaming network had no comment but confirmed that \u201cthe law was a factor in our decision not to film in North Carolina.\u201d\n\u201cThe decision to film in South Carolina is final,\u201d she added, \u201cand it\u2019s worth clarifying that we never started production in North Carolina.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nA number of LGBTQ advocacy groups and individuals applauded the news.\nAmong those to express disappointment over the decision was \u201cOBX\u201d creator Jonas Pate, who previously worked on \u201cFriday Night Lights\u201d\u00a0and \u201cAquarius,\u201d among other shows, and is a resident of Wilmington, North Carolina.\n\u201cThis tiny law is costing this town 70 good, clean, pension-paying jobs and also sending a message to those people who can bring these jobs and more that North Carolina still doesn\u2019t get it,\u201d he told\u00a0Wilmington Star News\u00a0on Jan. 7.\u00a0\n\u201cThis show would be a postcard to North Carolina,\u201d he added.\u00a0 \u00a0", "date": "\n01/11/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/netflix-north-carolina-obx_n_5c38db48e4b045f6768bc13c", "tags": "film wo legislation series \u201d anti-lgbtq obx carolina partly bill decision north law netflix"}
