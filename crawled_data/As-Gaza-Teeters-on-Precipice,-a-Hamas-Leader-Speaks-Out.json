{"title": "As Gaza Teeters on Precipice, a Hamas Leader Speaks Out", "content": "GAZA CITY \u2014 With a climactic confrontation expected days from now at the fence separating the Gaza Strip from Israel, where Palestinians have been demonstrating for weeks, Yehya Sinwar, the leader in Gaza of Hamas, the militant group that rules the territory, offered little hope for a bloodless encounter.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem with hundreds of thousands of people parading through a fence that\u2019s not a border?\u201d he said Thursday. \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem with an influx like that?\u201d\nMr. Sinwar offered lip service to nonviolence, saying he hoped that the presence of international journalists would constrain Israeli soldiers from massacring people who crossed the fence. But he demurred when asked if he would urge protesters to refrain from trying to cross the fence, as hundreds of others have tried with often fatal results. Since the demonstration began on March 30, 47 people have been killed and nearly 7,000 wounded.\nA day earlier, however, speaking to hundreds of young Gazans, Mr. Sinwar was far less restrained in his language, saying, \u201cWe would rather die as martyrs than die out of oppression and humiliation,\u201d and adding, \u201cWe are ready to die, and tens of thousands will die with us.\u201d\nThe protests are expected to peak on Monday, when the United States formally moves its embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, and on Tuesday, the 70th anniversary of what Palestinians call the Nakba, or catastrophe, when hundreds of thousands of them fled or were expelled from their homes in what became Israel.\nIn what was believed to be his first news conference as the leader of Hamas in Gaza, at least with foreign journalists, the press-shy Mr. Sinwar, who took over in February 2017, seemed to vacillate in tone between openness and moderation on the one hand, and vaguely menacing defiance on the other.\nHere is a look at his key points.\nGaza has been under an Israeli and Egyptian blockade since 2007, when Hamas seized power from the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority. The blockade strictly limits the flow of people and cargo in and out of Gaza. Under added pressure from Mahmoud Abbas, the authority\u2019s president, Gaza has suffered severe shortages of electricity and widespread layoffs that have sent its economy into a free-fall.\n\u201cIt\u2019s something Palestinians can\u2019t put up with anymore,\u201d Mr. Sinwar said. \u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable that we would continue dying slowly.\u201d\nMr. Sinwar, who was serving multiple life sentences for the abduction and killing of two Israeli soldiers before being released in a controversial prisoner exchange in 2011, said the siege was worse than jail.\n\u201cI lived 25 years, almost half my life, in Israeli prisons,\u201d he said in Arabic through an interpreter. \u201cLiving in those small rooms was much easier than living the way life is now run in Gaza.\u201d He said that it affected even his own young child: \u201cThe first words my son spoke were \u2018father,\u2019 \u2018mother\u2019 and \u2018drone.\u2019\u201d\nHamas insists that the protests are peaceful because the participants, it says, are unarmed. \u201cSome media are adopting the Israeli narrative,\u201d he complained.\n\u201cBut not one single bullet was shot at the Israeli forces. Not one rocket was fired.\u201d\nHe did not address the homemade firebombs, grenades and even flaming kites that participants in the protests have hurled or launched at Israel, according to the Israeli military.\nHe ridiculed Israeli accusations that the protesters have included members of the military wing of Hamas. \u201cWhat do you expect?\u201d he asked. \u201cIs it better that they launch rockets, or go to a peaceful march and end up being killed by armed-to-the-teeth Israeli soldiers?\u201d\nMr. Sinwar insisted that protesters \u201cpose no life threat to anyone, even the soldiers on the other side.\u201d\nYet in the next breath Mr. Sinwar likened Gaza residents to a \u201cvery hungry tiger, kept in a cage, starved, whom the Israelis have been trying to humiliate. Now it\u2019s on the loose, it\u2019s left its cage, and no one knows where it\u2019s heading or what it\u2019s going to do.\nAt other points he compared Gaza to a time bomb likely to explode at any moment.\nMr. Sinwar was frank in acknowledging what he called the \u201cpower imbalance\u201d between Israel and the Palestinians, as well as a changed Middle East in which the Palestinian cause has diminished in importance compared with geopolitical concerns like the spread of Iranian influence.\nGiven all that, he said: \u201cWe believe that if we have a way to potentially resolve the conflict without destruction, we\u2019re O.K. with that. We want to invest in peace and love.\u201d\nMr. Sinwar noted that he had some success with nonviolent protests in his Israeli prison, where he led hunger strikes to obtain better food and medical care and even to allow prisoners access to pens and paper.\n\u201cWhen we went on hunger strikes, the Israelis approached us,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s the same thing: We Palestinians are coming out in droves, looking for compromise, so there should be negotiations.\u201d\nHamas is not giving up its arsenal of rockets, however. \u201cWe would prefer to earn our rights by soft and peaceful means,\u201d Mr. Sinwar said. \u201cBut we understand that if we are not given those rights, we are entitled to earn them by resistance.\u201d\nMr. Sinwar pushed hard for reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah, the Palestinian faction that dominates the Palestinian Authority, led by Mr. Abbas, in the West Bank. Hamas made a number of major concessions, but Mr. Sinwar said it had received little in return, and he conceded that the opening for a successful unification had narrowed considerably.\nYet he insisted that, because the decision to pursue reconciliation was made as a group, his standing within Hamas had not suffered as a result. And he argued that, to the contrary, the protests had promoted the idea of reconciliation by uniting Palestinians of all factions against a common enemy, Israel.\n\u201cVisiting different encampments I was hugged, people kissed my hand,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019d tell me they\u2019re Fatah affiliates, yet they have the utmost love and respect for me.\u201d The protests, he said, were \u201chelping us reorganize our priorities: Instead of blaming each other, we\u2019re expressing our anger at the root cause.\u201d", "date": "May 10, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/10/world/middleeast/gaza-protests-yehya-sinwar.html", "tags": "teeters hamas precipice protests palestinians speaks \u201d gaza israeli leader said sinwar"}
