Illuminating them was the sickly yellow glow of 150 hazard lights. As guests filed in, their heels sank into the synthetic cushion and sent them a little off balance. Recognize the feeling? Welcome to a Prada show. Also your life.\n\u201cIn another century, there would be already war; all the violent parties, violent situations in Europe, racism,\u201d Miuccia Prada said afterward, besieged by journalists and well-wishers crowding ever closer. \u201cI feel really afraid.\u201d So she decided to make some clothes to try to resolve her emotions. What else can you do? That\u2019s the job.\n\u201cThat\u2019s another big problem for us designers,\u201d she said. \u201cWe work for rich people, do rich clothes but fashion is very relevant, so there is a kind of request to talk about other subjects. How do you find a way that is intelligent but not too superficial?\u201d\nIt\u2019s a good question at the moment, if a kind of annoyingly existential one, which may be why it\u2019s so hard to handle. At Tod\u2019s, for example, there\u2019s no effort to wrestle with complicated reality; instead there is \u2014 leather! As much of it as possible: tailored leather shorts and leather shirts and leather blazers; leather shift dresses and leather puffers; leather trench coats; nappa leather and patent leather. Oh, and some tweed. It\u2019s perfectly accomplished. But not convincing as the answer to everything.\nMore persuasive was Jeremy Scott, and his \u201cdon\u2019t we all just need a smile right now? Don\u2019t we all need a little levity in our lives?\u201d explanation backstage before his laugh-in of a Moschino game show.\nPart ode to \u201cThe Price is Right\u201d and \u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d as well as the muse of the night, Vanna White, and his own 2001 Jeremy Scott show in Paris (his last in that city; now his brand is based in New York) the show Thursday featured models with big (faux) furs and bigger hair, channeling the beaded evening gowns of television hostesses past as they vamped in gold and diamant\u00e9 around the promise of A New Car! or A New Fridge! or A Trip to Aspen!\nOthers strutted past in dollar bill miniskirts and pastel crystal-studded prints of detergent pods; foxy stuffed animal stoles and tiny taffeta cocktail dresses. There was a toothpaste duffel, a cash register handbag, and a complete TV dinner evening cape, with Salisbury steak and mashed potato as the entr\u00e9e, diced carrots and peas on the side. Wink-wink, nudge-nudge.\nIt was funny, no question, but even game show culture has a dark underbelly; problems, after all, can\u2019t really be solved by a spin of the wheel. In recent shows, Mr. Scott has started to grapple with some of the implications of his pop culture one-liners \u2014 almost making an art of it \u2014 but not this time.\nThis time he seemed distracted by the coming Met Gala, themed around Camp, and its red carpet needs and possibilities. So while there was a lot of sparkle and wit in the clothes (sparkling wit, even), ultimately it was all promise with no real payoff; escape, with little lasting effect.\nWhich doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t dream of a happy ending. Mrs. Prada did: One that toggled between Hitchcock heroines and frogwomen, love and war. It\u2019s a perennial story, after all \u2014 as human as our lust for a get-rich-quick scheme.\nThe high romance of portrait-necked 1950s party dresses in black wool and silk with swagged skirts caught up at the hip by O-rings, some splashed with bouquets of roses, alternated with crisp white shirt-dresses dangling three-dimensional satin tulips (they were kind of floppy, like they were on their last legs) and army green utilitarian suiting.\nLace capes were tossed atop periwinkle-blue shirting which was layered under loden Land Girl separates. Boots were big, and tractor-treaded. Pumps were delicate and sometimes glitter-festooned. Couture shawl draping mutated into Crombie tweeds. Frankenstein and his bride made goo-goo eyes at each other out of the darkness of a plain black sheath. There were a lot of Wednesday Addams braids and Cousin Itt backpacks.\nOn the soundtrack, \u201cMy Favorite Things\u201d from \u201cThe Sound of Music\u201d growled out like a threat. It was full of foreboding. But tension and the process of working through it had rarely looked as good.", "date": "Feb. 22, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/fashion/prada-moschino-jeremy-scott-milan.html", "tags": "fortune \u2018 little kind show big \u201d wheel leather war prada love \u2014 dressing clothes"}
