{"title": "Delay, Deny and Deflect: How Facebook\u2019s Leaders Fought Through Crisis", "content": "Sheryl Sandberg was seething.\nInside Facebook\u2019s Menlo Park, Calif., headquarters, top executives gathered in the glass-walled conference room of its founder, Mark Zuckerberg. It was September 2017, more than a year after Facebook engineers discovered suspicious Russia-linked activity on its site, an early warning of the Kremlin campaign to disrupt the 2016 American election. Congressional and federal investigators were closing in on evidence that would implicate the company.\nBut it wasn\u2019t the looming disaster at Facebook that angered Ms. Sandberg. It was the social network\u2019s security chief, Alex Stamos, who had informed company board members the day before that Facebook had yet to contain the Russian infestation. Mr. Stamos\u2019s briefing had prompted a humiliating boardroom interrogation of Ms. Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, and her billionaire boss. She appeared to regard the admission as a betrayal.\n[Sheryl Sandberg is said to have asked Facebook employees to examine George Soros\u2019s finances after he criticized the social media giant.]\n\u201cYou threw us under the bus!\u201d she yelled at Mr. Stamos, according to people who were present.\nThe clash that day would set off a reckoning \u2014 for Mr. Zuckerberg, for Ms. Sandberg and for the business they had built together. In just over a decade, Facebook has connected more than 2.2 billion people, a global nation unto itself that reshaped political campaigns, the advertising business and daily life around the world. Along the way, Facebook accumulated one of the largest-ever repositories of personal data, a treasure trove of photos, messages and likes that propelled the company into the Fortune 500.\n[Here\u2019s how Facebook failed to police how its partners handled user data.]\nBut as evidence accumulated that Facebook\u2019s power could also be exploited to disrupt elections, broadcast viral propaganda and inspire deadly campaigns of hate around the globe, Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg stumbled. Bent on growth, the pair ignored warning signs and then sought to conceal them from public view. At critical moments over the last three years, they were distracted by personal projects, and passed off security and policy decisions to subordinates, according to current and former executives.\nWhen Facebook users learned last spring that the company had compromised their privacy in its rush to expand, allowing access to the personal information of tens of millions of people to a political data firm linked to President Trump, Facebook sought to deflect blame and mask the extent of the problem.\nAnd when that failed \u2014 as the company\u2019s stock price plummeted and it faced a consumer backlash \u2014 Facebook went on the attack.\nWhile Mr. Zuckerberg has conducted a public apology tour in the last year, Ms. Sandberg has overseen an aggressive lobbying campaign to combat Facebook\u2019s critics, shift public anger toward rival companies and ward off damaging regulation. Facebook employed a Republican opposition-research firm to discredit activist protesters, in part by linking them to the liberal financier George Soros. It also tapped its business relationships, lobbying a Jewish civil rights group to cast some criticism of the company as anti-Semitic.\nIn Washington, allies of Facebook, including Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate leader, intervened on its behalf. And Ms. Sandberg wooed or cajoled hostile lawmakers, while trying to dispel Facebook\u2019s reputation as a bastion of Bay Area liberalism.\nThis account of how Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg navigated Facebook\u2019s cascading crises, much of which has not been previously reported, is based on interviews with more than 50 people. They include current and former Facebook executives and other employees, lawmakers and government officials, lobbyists and congressional staff members. Most spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed confidentiality agreements, were not authorized to speak to reporters or feared retaliation.\nFacebook declined to make Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg available for comment. In a statement, a spokesman acknowledged that Facebook had been slow to address its challenges but had since made progress fixing the platform.\n\u201cThis has been a tough time at Facebook and our entire management team has been focused on tackling the issues we face,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWhile these are hard problems we are working hard to ensure that people find our products useful and that we protect our community from bad actors.\u201d\nEven so, trust in the social network has sunk, while its pell-mell growth has slowed. Regulators and law enforcement officials in the United States and Europe are investigating Facebook\u2019s conduct with Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm that worked with Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, opening up the company to fines and other liability. Both the Trump administration and lawmakers have begun crafting proposals for a national privacy law, setting up a yearslong struggle over the future of Facebook\u2019s data-hungry business model.\n[Despite a turbulent two years, here\u2019s why almost no one in tech thinks Mark Zuckerberg should step down from the company he built.]\n\u201cWe failed to look and try to imagine what was hiding behind corners,\u201d Elliot Schrage, former vice president for global communications, marketing and public policy at Facebook, said in an interview.\nMr. Zuckerberg, 34, and Ms. Sandberg, 49, remain at the company\u2019s helm, while Mr. Stamos and other high-profile executives have left after disputes over Facebook\u2019s priorities. Mr. Zuckerberg, who controls the social network with 60 percent of the voting shares and who approved many of its directors, has been asked repeatedly in the last year whether he should step down as chief executive.\nHis answer each time: a resounding \u201cNo.\u201d\nThree years ago, Mr. Zuckerberg, who founded Facebook in 2004 while attending Harvard, was celebrated for the company\u2019s extraordinary success. Ms. Sandberg, a former Clinton administration official and Google veteran, had become a feminist icon with the publication of her empowerment manifesto, \u201cLean In,\u201d in 2013.\nLike other technology executives, Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg cast their company as a force for social good. Facebook\u2019s lofty aims were emblazoned even on securities filings: \u201cOur mission is to make the world more open and connected.\u201d\nBut as Facebook grew, so did the hate speech, bullying and other toxic content on the platform. When researchers and activists in Myanmar, India, Germany and elsewhere warned that Facebook had become an instrument of government propaganda and ethnic cleansing, the company largely ignored them. Facebook had positioned itself as a platform, not a publisher. Taking responsibility for what users posted, or acting to censor it, was expensive and complicated. Many Facebook executives worried that any such efforts would backfire.\nThen Donald J. Trump ran for president. He described Muslim immigrants and refugees as a danger to America, and in December 2015 posted a statement on Facebook calling for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown\u201d on Muslims entering the United States. Mr. Trump\u2019s call to arms \u2014 widely condemned by Democrats and some prominent Republicans \u2014 was shared more than 15,000 times on Facebook, an illustration of the site\u2019s power to spread racist sentiment.\nMr. Zuckerberg, who had helped found a nonprofit dedicated to immigration reform, was appalled, said employees who spoke to him or were familiar with the conversation. He asked Ms. Sandberg and other executives if Mr. Trump had violated Facebook\u2019s terms of service.\nThe question was unusual. Mr. Zuckerberg typically focused on broader technology issues; politics was Ms. Sandberg\u2019s domain. In 2010, Ms. Sandberg, a Democrat, had recruited a friend and fellow Clinton alum, Marne Levine, as Facebook\u2019s chief Washington representative. A year later, after Republicans seized control of the House, Ms. Sandberg installed another friend, a well-connected Republican: Joel Kaplan, who had attended Harvard with Ms. Sandberg and later served in the George W. Bush administration.\nSome at Facebook viewed Mr. Trump\u2019s 2015 attack on Muslims as an opportunity to finally take a stand against the hate speech coursing through its platform. But Ms. Sandberg, who was edging back to work after the death of her husband several months earlier, delegated the matter to Mr. Schrage and Monika Bickert, a former prosecutor whom Ms. Sandberg had recruited as the company\u2019s head of global policy management. Ms. Sandberg also turned to the Washington office \u2014 particularly to Mr. Kaplan, said people who participated in or were briefed on the discussions.\nIn video conference calls between the Silicon Valley headquarters and Washington, the three officials construed their task narrowly. They parsed the company\u2019s terms of service to see if the post, or Mr. Trump\u2019s account, violated Facebook\u2019s rules.\nMr. Kaplan argued that Mr. Trump was an important public figure and that shutting down his account or removing the statement could be seen as obstructing free speech, said three employees who knew of the discussions. He said it could also stoke a conservative backlash.\n\u201cDon\u2019t poke the bear,\u201d Mr. Kaplan warned.\nMr. Zuckerberg did not participate in the debate. Ms. Sandberg attended some of the video meetings but rarely spoke.\nMr. Schrage concluded that Mr. Trump\u2019s language had not violated Facebook\u2019s rules and that the candidate\u2019s views had public value. \u201cWe were trying to make a decision based on all the legal and technical evidence before us,\u201d he said in an interview.\nIn the end, Mr. Trump\u2019s statement and account remained on the site. When Mr. Trump won election the next fall, giving Republicans control of the White House as well as Congress, Mr. Kaplan was empowered to plan accordingly. The company hired a former aide to Mr. Trump\u2019s new attorney general, Jeff Sessions, along with lobbying firms linked to Republican lawmakers who had jurisdiction over internet companies.\nBut inside Facebook, new troubles were brewing.\nIn the final months of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, Russian agents escalated a yearlong effort to hack and harass his Democratic opponents, culminating in the release of thousands of emails stolen from prominent Democrats and party officials.\nFacebook had said nothing publicly about any problems on its own platform. But in the spring of 2016, a company expert on Russian cyberwarfare spotted something worrisome. He reached out to his boss, Mr. Stamos.\nMr. Stamos\u2019s team discovered that Russian hackers appeared to be probing Facebook accounts for people connected to the presidential campaigns, said two employees. Months later, as Mr. Trump battled Hillary Clinton in the general election, the team also found Facebook accounts linked to Russian hackers who were messaging journalists to share information from the stolen emails.\nMr. Stamos, 39, told Colin Stretch, Facebook\u2019s general counsel, about the findings, said two people involved in the conversations. At the time, Facebook had no policy on disinformation or any resources dedicated to searching for it.\nMr. Stamos, acting on his own, then directed a team to scrutinize the extent of Russian activity on Facebook. In December 2016, after Mr. Zuckerberg publicly scoffed at the idea that fake news on Facebook had helped elect Mr. Trump, Mr. Stamos \u2014 alarmed that the company\u2019s chief executive seemed unaware of his team\u2019s findings \u2014 met with Mr. Zuckerberg, Ms. Sandberg and other top Facebook leaders.\nMs. Sandberg was angry. Looking into the Russian activity without approval, she said, had left the company exposed legally. Other executives asked Mr. Stamos why they had not been told sooner.\nStill, Ms. Sandberg and Mr. Zuckerberg decided to expand on Mr. Stamos\u2019s work, creating a group called Project P, for \u201cpropaganda,\u201d to study false news on the site, according to people involved in the discussions. By January 2017, the group knew that Mr. Stamos\u2019s original team had only scratched the surface of Russian activity on Facebook, and pressed to issue a public paper about their findings.\nBut Mr. Kaplan and other Facebook executives objected. Washington was already reeling from an official finding by American intelligence agencies that Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, had personally ordered an influence campaign aimed at helping elect Mr. Trump.\nIf Facebook implicated Russia further, Mr. Kaplan said, Republicans would accuse the company of siding with Democrats. And if Facebook pulled down the Russians\u2019 fake pages, regular Facebook users might also react with outrage at having been deceived: His own mother-in-law, Mr. Kaplan said, had followed a Facebook page created by Russian trolls.\nMs. Sandberg sided with Mr. Kaplan, recalled four people involved. Mr. Zuckerberg \u2014 who spent much of 2017 on a national \u201clistening tour,\u201d feeding cows in Wisconsin and eating dinner with Somali refugees in Minnesota \u2014 did not participate in the conversations about the public paper. When it was  published that April, the word \u201cRussia\u201d never appeared.\nMs. Sandberg\u2019s subordinates took a similar approach in Washington, where the Senate had begun pursuing its own investigation, led by Richard Burr, the North Carolina Republican, and Mark Warner, the Virginia Democrat. Throughout the spring and summer of 2017, Facebook officials repeatedly played down Senate investigators\u2019 concerns about the company, while publicly claiming there had been no Russian effort of any significance on Facebook.\nBut inside the company, employees were tracing more ads, pages and groups back to Russia. That June, a Times reporter provided Facebook a list of accounts with suspected ties to Russia, seeking more information on their provenance. By August 2017, Facebook executives concluded that the situation had become what one called a \u201cfive-alarm fire,\u201d said a person familiar with the discussions.\nMr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg agreed to go public with some findings, and laid plans to release a blog post on Sept. 6, 2017, the day of the company\u2019s quarterly board meeting.\nAfter Mr. Stamos and his team drafted the post, however, Ms. Sandberg and her deputies insisted it be less specific. She and Mr. Zuckerberg also asked Mr. Stamos and Mr. Stretch to brief the board\u2019s audit committee, chaired by Erskine Bowles, the patrician investor and White House veteran.\nMr. Stretch and Mr. Stamos went into more detail with the audit committee than planned, warning that Facebook was likely to find even more evidence of Russian interference.\nThe disclosures set off Mr. Bowles, who after years in Washington could anticipate how lawmakers might react. He grilled the two men, occasionally cursing, on how Facebook had allowed itself to become a tool for Russian interference. He demanded to know why it had taken so long to uncover the activity, and why Facebook directors were only now being told.\nWhen the full board gathered later that day at a room at the company\u2019s headquarters reserved for sensitive meetings, Mr. Bowles pelted questions at Facebook\u2019s founder and second-in-command. Ms. Sandberg, visibly unsettled, apologized. Mr. Zuckerberg, stone-faced, whirred through technical fixes, said three people who attended or were briefed on the proceedings.\nLater that day, the company\u2019s abbreviated blog post went up. It said little about fake accounts or the organic posts created by Russian trolls that had gone viral on Facebook, disclosing only that Russian agents had spent roughly $100,000 \u2014 a relatively tiny sum \u2014 on approximately 3,000 ads.\nJust one day after the company\u2019s carefully sculpted admission, The Times published an investigation of further Russian activity on Facebook, showing how Russian intelligence had used fake accounts to promote emails stolen from the Democratic Party and prominent Washington figures.\nThe combined revelations infuriated Democrats, finally fracturing the political consensus that had protected Facebook and other big tech companies from Beltway interference. Republicans, already concerned that the platform was censoring conservative views, accused Facebook of fueling what they claimed were meritless conspiracy charges against Mr. Trump and Russia. Democrats, long allied with Silicon Valley on issues including immigration and gay rights, now blamed Mr. Trump\u2019s win partly on Facebook\u2019s tolerance for fraud and disinformation.\nAfter stalling for weeks, Facebook eventually agreed to hand over the Russian posts to Congress. Twice in October 2017, Facebook was forced to revise its public statements, finally acknowledging that close to 126 million people had seen the Russian posts.\nThe same month, Mr. Warner and Senator Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota Democrat, introduced legislation to compel Facebook and other internet firms to disclose who bought political ads on their sites \u2014 a significant expansion of federal regulation over tech companies.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for Facebook to let all of us see the ads bought by Russians *and paid for in Rubles* during the last election,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar wrote on her own Facebook page.\nFacebook girded for battle. Days after the bill was unveiled, Facebook hired Mr. Warner\u2019s former chief of staff, Luke Albee, to lobby on it. Mr. Kaplan\u2019s team took a larger role in managing the company\u2019s Washington response, routinely reviewing Facebook news releases for words or phrases that might rile conservatives.\nMs. Sandberg also reached out to Ms. Klobuchar. She had been friendly with the senator, who is featured on the website for Lean In, Ms. Sandberg\u2019s empowerment initiative. Ms. Sandberg had contributed a blurb to Ms. Klobuchar\u2019s 2015 memoir, and the senator\u2019s chief of staff had previously worked at Ms. Sandberg\u2019s charitable foundation.\nBut in a tense conversation shortly after the ad legislation was introduced, Ms. Sandberg complained about Ms. Klobuchar\u2019s attacks on the company, said a person who was briefed on the call. Ms. Klobuchar did not back down on her legislation. But she dialed down her criticism in at least one venue important to the company: After blasting Facebook repeatedly that fall on her own Facebook page, Ms. Klobuchar hardly mentioned the company in posts between November and February.\nA spokesman for Ms. Klobuchar said in a statement that Facebook\u2019s lobbying had not lessened her commitment to holding the company accountable. \u201cFacebook was pushing to exclude issue ads from the Honest Ads Act, and Senator Klobuchar strenuously disagreed and refused to change the bill,\u201d he said.\nIn October 2017, Facebook also expanded its work with a Washington-based consultant, Definers Public Affairs, that had originally been hired to monitor press coverage of the company. Founded by veterans of Republican presidential politics, Definers specialized in applying political campaign tactics to corporate public relations \u2014 an approach long employed in Washington by big telecommunications firms and activist hedge fund managers, but less common in tech.\nDefiners had established a Silicon Valley outpost earlier that year, led by Tim Miller, a former spokesman for Jeb Bush who preached the virtues of campaign-style opposition research. For tech firms, he argued in one interview, a goal should be to \u201chave positive content pushed out about your company and negative content that\u2019s being pushed out about your competitor.\u201d\nFacebook quickly adopted that strategy. In November 2017, the social network came out in favor of a bill called the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, which made internet companies responsible for sex trafficking ads on their sites.\nGoogle and others had fought the bill for months, worrying it would set a cumbersome precedent. But the sex trafficking bill was championed by Senator John Thune, a Republican of South Dakota who had pummeled Facebook over accusations that it censored conservative content, and Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat and senior commerce committee member who was a frequent critic of Facebook.\nFacebook broke ranks with other tech companies, hoping the move would help repair relations on both sides of the aisle, said two congressional staffers and three tech industry officials.\nWhen the bill came to a vote in the House in February, Ms. Sandberg offered public support online, urging Congress to \u201cmake sure we pass meaningful and strong legislation to stop sex trafficking.\u201d\nIn March, The Times, The Observer of London and The Guardian prepared to publish a joint investigation into how Facebook user data had been appropriated by Cambridge Analytica to profile American voters. A few days before publication, The Times presented Facebook with evidence that copies of improperly acquired Facebook data still existed, despite earlier promises by Cambridge executives and others to delete it.\nMr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg met with their lieutenants to determine a response. They decided to pre-empt the stories, saying in a statement published late on a Friday night that Facebook had suspended Cambridge Analytica from its platform. The executives figured that getting ahead of the news would soften its blow, according to people in the discussions.\nThey were wrong. The story drew worldwide outrage, prompting lawsuits and official investigations in Washington, London and Brussels. For days, Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg remained out of sight, mulling how to respond. While the Russia investigation had devolved into an increasingly partisan battle, the Cambridge scandal set off Democrats and Republicans alike. And in Silicon Valley, other tech firms began exploiting the outcry to burnish their own brands.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to traffic in your personal life,\u201d Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said in an MSNBC interview. \u201cPrivacy to us is a human right. It\u2019s a civil liberty.\u201d (Mr. Cook\u2019s criticisms infuriated Mr. Zuckerberg, who later ordered his management team to use only Android phones \u2014 arguing that the operating system had far more users than Apple\u2019s.)\nFacebook scrambled anew. Executives quietly shelved an internal communications campaign, called \u201cWe Get It,\u201d meant to assure employees that the company was committed to getting back on track in 2018.\nThen Facebook went on the offensive. Mr. Kaplan prevailed on Ms. Sandberg to promote Kevin Martin, a former Federal Communications Commission chairman and fellow Bush administration veteran, to lead the company\u2019s American lobbying efforts. Facebook also expanded its work with Definers.\nOn a conservative news site called the NTK Network, dozens of articles blasted Google and Apple for unsavory business practices. One story called Mr. Cook hypocritical for chiding Facebook over privacy, noting that Apple also collects reams of data from users. Another played down the impact of the Russians\u2019 use of Facebook.\nThe rash of news coverage was no accident: NTK is an affiliate of Definers, sharing offices and staff with the public relations firm in Arlington, Va. Many NTK Network stories are written by staff members at Definers or America Rising, the company\u2019s political opposition-research arm, to attack their clients\u2019 enemies. While the NTK Network does not have a large audience of its own, its content is frequently picked up by popular conservative outlets, including Breitbart.\nMr. Miller acknowledged that Facebook and Apple do not directly compete. Definers\u2019 work on Apple is funded by a third technology company, he said, but Facebook has pushed back against Apple because Mr. Cook\u2019s criticism upset Facebook.\nIf the privacy issue comes up, Facebook is happy to \u201cmuddy the waters,\u201d Mr. Miller said over drinks at an Oakland, Calif., bar last month.\nOn Thursday, after this article was published, Facebook said that it had ended its relationship with Definers, without citing a reason.\nIn public, Facebook was more conciliatory. Mr. Zuckerberg agreed to testify on Capitol Hill. The company unveiled a gauzy advertising campaign, titled \u201cHere Together,\u201d to apologize to its users. Days before Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s appearance in Congress in April, Facebook announced that it was endorsing Ms. Klobuchar\u2019s Honest Ads bill and would pre-emptively begin disclosing political ad buyers. It also informed users whose data had been improperly harvested by Cambridge Analytica.\nBut Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s good-will tour was bumpy. Thanks to intensive coaching and preparation, the company\u2019s communications team believed, he had effectively parried tough questions at the April hearing. But they worried he had come off as robotic \u2014 a suspicion confirmed by Facebook\u2019s pollsters.\nMr. Zuckerberg\u2019s political instincts were no more well-tuned. During a break in one hearing, he buttonholed Greg Walden, an Oregon Republican who leads the House Energy and Commerce Committee, to express his surprise at how tough on Facebook Democrats had been.\nMr. Walden was taken aback, said people who knew of the remark. Facebook\u2019s leader, Mr. Walden realized, did not understand the breadth of the anger now aimed at his creation.\nMs. Sandberg had said little publicly about the company\u2019s problems. But inside Facebook, her approach had begun to draw criticism.\nSome colleagues believed that Ms. Sandberg \u2014 whose ambitions to return to public life were much discussed at the company \u2014 was protecting her own brand at Facebook\u2019s expense. At one company gathering, said two people who knew of the event, friends told Ms. Sandberg that if Facebook did not address the scandals effectively, its role in spreading hate and fear would define her legacy, too.\nSo Ms. Sandberg began taking a more personal role in the company\u2019s Washington campaign, drawing on all the polish that Mr. Zuckerberg sometimes lacked. She not only relied on her old Democratic ties, but also sought to assuage skeptical Republicans, who grumbled that Facebook was more sensitive to the political opinions of its work force than to those of powerful committee leaders. Trailing an entourage of as many as 10 people on trips to the capital, Ms. Sandberg made a point of sending personal thank-you notes to lawmakers and others she met.\nHer top Republican target was Mr. Burr, whose Senate committee\u2019s Russia investigation had chugged along. The two spoke by phone, according to a congressional staff member and a Facebook executive, and met in person this fall. While critics cast Facebook as a serial offender that had ignored repeated warning signs about the dangers posed by its product, Ms. Sandberg argued that the company was grappling earnestly with the consequences of its extraordinary growth.\nShe made the same case in June at a conference of the National Association of Attorneys General in Portland, Ore. At the time, several attorneys general had opened or joined investigations into the company. Facebook was eager to head off further trouble.\nThe company organized several private receptions, including what was billed as a conversation with Ms. Sandberg about \u201ccorporate citizenship in the digital age\u201d and a briefing on Cambridge Analytica.\nWhile Facebook had publicly declared itself ready for new federal regulations, Ms. Sandberg privately contended that the social network was already adopting the best reforms and policies available. Heavy-handed regulation, she warned, would only disadvantage smaller competitors.\nSome of the officials were skeptical. But Ms. Sandberg\u2019s presence \u2014 companies typically send lower-ranking executives to such gatherings \u2014 persuaded others that Facebook was serious about addressing its problems, according to two who attended the conference.\nFacebook also continued to look for ways to deflect criticism to rivals. In June, after The Times reported on Facebook\u2019s previously undisclosed deals to share user data with device makers \u2014 partnerships Facebook had failed to disclose to lawmakers \u2014 executives ordered up focus groups in Washington.\nIn separate sessions with liberals and conservatives, about a dozen at a time, Facebook previewed messages to lawmakers. Among the approaches it tested was bringing YouTube and other social media platforms into the controversy, while arguing that Google struck similar data-sharing deals.\nBy then, some of the harshest criticism of Facebook was coming from the political left, where activists and policy experts had begun calling for the company to be broken up.\nIn July, organizers with a coalition called Freedom from Facebook crashed a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee, where a company executive was testifying about its policies. As the executive spoke, the organizers held aloft signs depicting Ms. Sandberg and Mr. Zuckerberg, who are both Jewish, as two heads of an octopus stretching around the globe.\nEddie Vale, a Democratic public relations strategist who led the protest, later said the image was meant to evoke old cartoons of Standard Oil, the Gilded Age monopoly. But a Facebook official quickly called the Anti-Defamation League, a leading Jewish civil rights organization, to flag the sign. Facebook and other tech companies had partnered with the civil rights group since late 2017 on an initiative to combat anti-Semitism and hate speech online.\nThat afternoon, the A.D.L. issued a warning from its Twitter account.\n\u201cDepicting Jews as an octopus encircling the globe is a classic anti-Semitic trope,\u201d the organization wrote. \u201cProtest Facebook \u2014 or anyone \u2014 all you want, but pick a different image.\u201d The criticism was soon echoed in conservative outlets including The Washington Free Beacon, which has sought to tie Freedom from Facebook to what the publication calls \u201cextreme anti-Israel groups.\u201d\nAn A.D.L. spokeswoman, Betsaida Alcantara, said the group routinely fielded reports of anti-Semitic slurs from journalists, synagogues and others. \u201cOur experts evaluate each one based on our years of experience, and we respond appropriately,\u201d Ms. Alcantara said. (The group has at times sharply criticized Facebook, including when Mr. Zuckerberg suggested that his company should not censor Holocaust deniers.)\nFacebook also used Definers to take on bigger opponents, such as Mr. Soros, a longtime boogeyman to mainstream conservatives and the target of intense anti-Semitic smears on the far right. A research document circulated by Definers to reporters this summer, just a month after the House hearing, cast Mr. Soros as the unacknowledged force behind what appeared to be a broad anti-Facebook movement.\nHe was a natural target. In a speech at the World Economic Forum in January, he had attacked Facebook and Google, describing them as a monopolist \u201cmenace\u201d with \u201cneither the will nor the inclination to protect society against the consequences of their actions.\u201d\nDefiners pressed reporters to explore the financial connections between Mr. Soros\u2019s family or philanthropies and groups that were members of Freedom from Facebook, such as Color of Change, an online racial justice organization, as well as a progressive group founded by Mr. Soros\u2019s son. (An official at Mr. Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations said the philanthropy had supported both member groups, but not Freedom from Facebook, and had made no grants to support campaigns against Facebook.)\nDefiners also circulated research about other critics of Facebook, such as Diamond and Silk, the pro-Trump social media stars who had claimed they were treated unfairly by Facebook.\nIn at least one instance, the company also relied on Mr. Schumer, the New York senator and Senate Democratic leader. He has long worked to advance Silicon Valley\u2019s interests on issues such as commercial drone regulations and patent reform. During the 2016 election cycle, he raised more money from Facebook employees than any other member of Congress, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\nMr. Schumer also has a personal connection to Facebook: His daughter Alison joined the firm out of college and is now a marketing manager in Facebook\u2019s New York office, according to her LinkedIn profile.\nIn July, as Facebook\u2019s troubles threatened to cost the company billions of dollars in market value, Mr. Schumer confronted Mr. Warner, by then Facebook\u2019s most insistent inquisitor in Congress.\nBack off, he told Mr. Warner, according to a Facebook employee briefed on Mr. Schumer\u2019s intervention. Mr. Warner should be looking for ways to work with Facebook, Mr. Schumer advised, not harm it. Facebook lobbyists were kept abreast of Mr. Schumer\u2019s efforts to protect the company, according to the employee.\nA Senate aide briefed on the exchange said that Mr. Schumer had not wanted Mr. Warner to lose sight of the need for Facebook to tackle problems with right-wing disinformation and election interference, as well as consumer privacy and other issues.\nOne morning in late summer, workers layered opaque contact paper onto the windows of a conference room in Facebook\u2019s Washington office. Not long after, a security guard was posted outside the door. It was an unusual sight: Facebook prided itself on open office plans and transparent, glass-walled conference rooms.\nBut Ms. Sandberg was set to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee \u2014 a pivotal encounter for her embattled company \u2014 and her aides were taking no chances.\nInside the room, they labored to prepare her for the hearing. They had assembled a binder-size briefing book, covering virtually every issue she might be questioned about, and had hired a former White House lawyer who specialized in training corporate executives.\nFacebook lobbyists had already worked the Intelligence Committee hard, asking that lawmakers refrain from questioning Ms. Sandberg about privacy issues, Cambridge Analytica and censorship. The argument was persuasive with Mr. Burr, who was determined to avoid a circuslike atmosphere. A day before the hearing, he issued a stern warning to all committee members to stick to the topic of election interference.\nIn the committee room the next day was an empty chair behind a placard labeled \u201cGoogle.\u201d Facebook had lobbied for the hearing to include a Google emissary of similar rank to Ms. Sandberg. The company won a partial victory when Mr. Burr announced that Larry Page, a Google co-founder, had been invited, along with Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive.\nMr. Dorsey showed up.
