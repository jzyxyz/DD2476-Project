{"title": "The Professor Behind the Trump Campaign Adviser Charges", "content": "LONDON \u2014 Joseph Mifsud, who investigators say tempted a Trump campaign official with a promise of Russian  \u201cdirt\u201d on Hillary Clinton, always presented himself as a professor, according to several online biographies and a person who knows him. But his academic affiliations are hard to pin down.\nHe identified himself as the director of the London Academy of Diplomacy \u2014 or, on another web page, as its honorary director. But the academy is difficult to find.\nThe academy was affiliated with the University of East Anglia until 2014, before transferring its affiliation to the University of Stirling, in Scotland, the University of East Anglia said in a statement on Tuesday.\nIn a biography that was previously displayed on the website of the London Center of International Law Practice, where Mr. Mifsud was the director of international strategic development, there is no mention of academic training or any degrees he may have earned. Instead, he is listed as the \u201chonorary director\u201d of the London Academy of Diplomacy, an \u201chonorary\u201d professor at the University of East Anglia and a full professor at Stirling University.\nA spokesman for Stirling University, however, said that Mr. Mifsud \u201chas been a full-time, professorial teaching fellow in the university\u2019s politics department since May 2017.\u201d\nThe biography goes on to say that Mr. Mifsud has \u201clectured extensively throughout the world,\u201d \u201cworked in a number of universities,\u201d \u201cattended and chaired conferences\u201d and \u201corganized major ministerial and institutional meetings on pan-Mediterranean dialogue.\u201d\nMr. Mifsud\u2019s principal experience in diplomacy or international relations appears to have been work for the government of the Mediterranean island state of Malta. A biography of Mr. Mifsud on the website of an organization calling itself the Society for Intercultural Education Training and Research said he worked in the Maltese Foreign Ministry, in the Ministry of Education and as the head of an unidentified department at the University of Malta.\nIt is unclear how he ended up in London, and he did not respond to a request for comment.\nMr. Mifsud was an enthusiastic promoter of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. He was a regular at meetings of the Valdai Discussion Club, an annual conference held in Sochi, Russia, that Mr. Putin attends. Three short articles on the Valdai website cite Mr. Mifsud as an expert echoing Russian government views.\n\u201cAs more and more differences emerge between Saudi Arabia and the United States, it is time for Moscow and Riyadh to intensify their relations, Mifsud believes,\u201d one article stated, before quoting Mr. Mifsud: \u201c\u2018I feel there is a taste for this relationship to develop between the Russian Federation and Saudi Arabia.\u201d\nAnother article, written by Mr. Mifsud, argued against the closer integration of the European Union, and a third, also by Mr. Mifsud, lauded Mr. Putin\u2019s intervention in Syria while finding American leadership \u201cdespondently lacking.\u201d\nMr. Mifsud\u2019s unusual r\u00e9sum\u00e9, however, did not appear to raise alarms with George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign, according to court papers filed on Monday in Federal District Court for the District of Columbia by the special prosecutor investigating Russian interference in the election. Mr. Papadopoulos has pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. about his conversations with the \u201cprofessor.\u201d\nMr. Mifsud is referred to in the papers only as \u201cthe professor,\u201d based in London, but a Senate aide familiar with emails involving Mr. Mifsud \u2014 lawmakers in both the Senate and the House are investigating Russia\u2019s role in the election \u2014 confirmed that he was the person cited.\nMr. Papadopoulos was an energy consultant before he joined the Trump campaign, and Mr. Mifsud was \u201cinitially\u201d uninterested in him until he disclosed his Trump campaign role, the prosecutors wrote in the court papers. Then, they said, Mr. Mifsud \u201cappeared to take great interest.\u201d\nWhen the two men first met, in Italy in March 2016, Mr. Mifsud quickly promised \u201cdirt\u201d on Mrs. Clinton, prosecutors say.\nMr. Papadopoulos \u201cunderstood that the professor had substantial connections to Russian government officials\u201d and \u201crepeatedly sought to use the professor\u2019s Russian connections in an effort to arrange a meeting between the campaign and Russian government officials,\u201d the prosecutors wrote.\nOn March 24, 2016, Mr. Mifsud falsely presented a young Russian woman as a niece of Mr. Putin\u2019s and introduced her to Mr. Papadopoulos, prosecutors wrote. Mr. Papadopoulos emailed his campaign supervisor about his promising meeting with his \u201cgood friend\u201d \u2014 Mr. Mifsud \u2014 and \u201cPutin\u2019s niece.\u201d\nMr. Papadopoulos emailed both Mr. Mifsud and the Russian woman the following month, on April 10, about setting up a potential trip to Russia.\n\u201cThis is already been agreed,\u201d Mr. Mifsud replied. \u201cI am flying to Moscow on the 18th for a Valdai meeting, plus other meetings at the Duma,\u201d a reference to a Russian legislative body.\n\u201cI have already alerted my personal links to our conversation and your request,\u201d the Russian woman wrote to Mr. Papadopoulos.\nMr. Mifsud then put Mr. Papadopoulos in contact with the Russian Foreign Ministry and, on April 26, met Mr. Papadopoulos for breakfast in London. Mr. Mifsud said he had returned from meetings with high-level officials in Moscow. There, he said, he learned that the Russians had \u201cdirt\u201d on Mrs. Clinton as Mr. Papadopoulos later told the F.B.I.\nFour days later, Mr. Papadopoulos thanked Mr. Mifsud for his \u201ccritical help\u201d in arranging a possible meeting between the Trump campaign and Russian officials.", "date": "Oct. 31, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/world/europe/russia-us-election-joseph-mifsud.html", "tags": "adviser papadopoulos russian \u201d trump charges university mifsud behind london campaign professor \u2014"}
