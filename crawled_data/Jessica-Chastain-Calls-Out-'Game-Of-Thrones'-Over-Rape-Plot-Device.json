The #littlebird was always a Phoenix,\u201d she added. \u201cHer prevailing strength is solely because of her. And her alone.\u201d\nChastain\u2019s comments provoked debate on Twitter:\nTurner, 23, stars alongside Chastain, 42, in \u201cX-Men: Dark Phoenix.\u201d She has not responded to Chastain\u2019s criticism of the scene.\nBut on Bolton\u2019s savage death by his own hounds, Turner told Rolling Stone magazine last month it was \u201cthe most satisfying scene.\u201d\n\u201cIt made me so emotional because I\u2019ve been waiting so long for her to stand up to the people who have done her wrong,\u201d she explained.", "date": "\n05/08/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jessica-chastain-game-of-thrones-rape-plot-device_n_5cd293cbe4b0a7dffccec124", "tags": "calls rape game stark plot played \u201d turner ramsay jessica device thrones chastain"}
