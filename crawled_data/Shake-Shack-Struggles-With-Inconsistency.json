{"title": "Shake Shack Struggles With Inconsistency", "content": "AFTER tossing out one of those limp politician\u2019s jokes about how its arrival in Brooklyn meant that Shake Shack had finally \u201chit the big time,\u201d Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg snipped through a green ribbon Dec. 20 to formally open the chain\u2019s location on Fulton Mall.\nIt is not every day that the mayor serves as midwife at the birth of a hamburger stand, but it is not every hamburger stand that achieves the prominent spot in the city\u2019s consciousness held by Shake Shack. There are 14 of them now, uptown, downtown and out of town (Miami, Washington, Kuwait City). One respectable writer has spoken of the burger as life-changing.\nFrom its origins as a hot-dog cart that the restaurateur Danny Meyer set up as a kind of art project in 2001, Shake Shack has become one of the most influential restaurants of the last decade, studied and copied around the country. Its legacy can be seen not just in the stampede of good, cheap burgers, but in the growing recognition that certain fine-dining values, like caring service and premium ingredients, can be profitably applied outside fine dining all the way down the scale to the most debased restaurant genre of all, the fast-food outlet.\nTo answer two obvious questions right away:\nYes, I would give stars to a hamburger stand.\nNo, probably not four stars.\nWhile the mayor was talking, a line had formed. Lines are so central to the Shake Shack experience that they have symbolic overtones. The line is democratic: everybody waits, including Mr. Meyer\u2019s children. It is a signal of freshness: everybody waits, because the food is cooked to order. It is the people\u2019s endorsement: everybody waits, so it must be worth it.\nI ate at the Shake Shack in Brooklyn and others around the city more than a dozen times recently. After about a third of those trips, I walked away thinking, \u201cWow, that was an awesome burger.\u201d The other times, the food generally wasn\u2019t worth the wait. Finally I understood that the people in line were looking for something that doesn\u2019t come in a wax-paper wrapper.\nShake Shack\u2019s pitch is that, yes, even in New York, we can all return to a simpler, cleaner, friendlier place and time. It delivers on that pitch most reliably in its shakes and custards.\nThe shakes are smooth, not crunchy with ice crystals, and drinkable, not so stiff that they fight the straw. And the flavors are true. A live current of caffeine pulses through the Fair Shake, made from vanilla ice cream swirled with coffee extract. (For those who like a different kind of buzz, Shake Shack has pints of Brooklyn Brewery\u2019s easygoing Shackmeister ale. It also pours wine into stemless tulip-shaped glasses. You don\u2019t realize they\u2019re plastic until you touch them.)\nI was never let down by the hot dogs, bought from Chicago\u2019s irreplaceable Vienna Beef, which were split down the middle, griddled and laid in a toasted potato bun with or without the classic Chicago garnishes. Better yet is the Bird Dog, a smoked chicken and apple bratwurst from Usinger\u2019s of Milwaukee.\nHow the burger could change lives I never divined, but on occasion it was magnificent, as beefy and flavorful as the outer quarter-inch of a Peter Luger porterhouse.\nMore often, though, the meat was cooked to the color of wet newsprint, inside and out, and salted so meekly that eating it was as satisfying as hearing a friend talk about a burger his cousin ate.\nEven when the burgers were great, they could be great in one of two distinct ways. In the classic Shake Shack patty, a tower of ground beef is flattened against a searing griddle with a metal press and made to stay there, spitting and hissing, until one surface turns all brown and crunchy. A patty handled this way takes command of a Shackburger, standing up to its tangy sauce, its crisp lettuce, its wheels of plum tomato.\nSometimes, though, the grill cook hadn\u2019t had the energy needed for smashing and searing. Instead the patty was tall, soft and melting, so pink inside that its juices began to soak the bun at the first bite. Good as this version was, it was anomalous.\nShake Shack wasn\u2019t even consistently inconsistent. Once when I ordered a double burger, one patty was browned all the way through while the other was the color of a ripe watermelon inside.\nWhen Shake Shack\u2019s slant-roofed kiosk first landed in Madison Square in 2004, it handily outclassed its nearest rivals, places like McDonald\u2019s and Burger King. But success has bred better competitors. Today, for less than $10, you can get a burger at least as flavorful at Schnipper\u2019s Quality Kitchen, FoodParc, Bill\u2019s Bar & Burger and Steak \u2019n Shake Signature.\nIn the early days, Shake Shack\u2019s commitment to better ingredients, like antibiotic- and hormone-free \u201c100 percent all-natural\u201d Angus beef, might have seemed progressive. Now, you can get inexpensive burgers with a stronger promise of sustainability, made from beef that is local, organic or grass-fed, at Steak \u2019n Shake, Bark Hot Dogs, Bareburger, Whitmans and others.\nAnd you can get better fries just about anywhere.\nConsidered as d\u00e9cor, the crinkle-cut fries are exactly right, calling up images of the milkshake-with-two-straws past that is at the core of Shake Shack\u2019s appeal. Considered as food, though, they are pretty awful. Freezing turns them mealy, and no amount of oil or salt can make them taste like the fresh-cut potatoes that are standard issue at some burger joints now.\nMr. Meyer runs one of the world\u2019s great restaurant companies. Can\u2019t one of his chefs show him how to make a decent French fry?\nOr help to upgrade the Shroom Burger? This item, a deep-fried portobello mushroom, erupts in a gushing flow of bland molten cheese that can scorch your hand when it\u2019s hot and that grows even less appetizing as it cools. Though it has its fans, to me it is a bitter, slippery, 570-calorie throwback to the dark ages of meatless cooking, a don\u2019t-care package for vegetarians.\nA restaurant with a menu as limited as Shake Shack\u2019s should not have this many weak spots. Yet as with many of Mr. Meyer\u2019s restaurants, the food is not the only attraction. It may not even be the primary one.\nBefore Shack Shack, buying cheap burgers was rarely uplifting. Recently at a McDonald\u2019s in Brooklyn, I waited to order as the people on the registers traded loud profanities with customers who were, I guess, their friends.\nA few months later, I went to the Shake Shack in Brooklyn with a friend\u2019s 7-year-old daughter, who truly does seem to live on bread alone. Burgers and hot dogs were not doing it for her.\n\u201cI want a grilled cheese,\u201d she said firmly, and before I could tell her that it wasn\u2019t on the menu, an order-taker leaned across the counter. \u201cI can make you a grilled cheese,\u201d he told her. They both smiled.\nOne little piece of stagecraft at Shake Shack sums up the Meyer approach. It is handled so smoothly that I noticed it only after my 10th or 11th meal. When I reached the front of the line and made my request, I was, as always, handed a buzzer that vibrates when the food is ready. Then I was asked my name.\nAs I made up an alias, it occurred to me for the first time that if you summon customers with a buzzer, you don\u2019t need names.\nExcept at Shake Shack. When I went up to get my takeout bag, the woman at the counter looked me in the eye and said, \u201cHave a great night, Tony.\u201d\nIt was almost enough to make me stand in line again right then and there, and my name isn\u2019t even Tony.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0", "date": "FEB. 21, 2012FEB. 21, 2012FEB. 21, 2012FEB. 21, 2012FEB. 21, 2012", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/22/dining/reviews/shake-shack-struggles-with-inconsistency.html", "tags": "burger burgers meyer even \u201d one shack struggles shake brooklyn inconsistency"}
