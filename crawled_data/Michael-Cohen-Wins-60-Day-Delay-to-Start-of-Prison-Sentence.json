Cohen, the former lawyer and fixer for President Trump who was to report early next month to begin serving a three-year prison sentence, was granted a two-month delay on Wednesday before he must surrender to the authorities.\nMr. Cohen, 52, must now report to a facility designated by the Bureau of Prisons on May 6, a federal judge in Manhattan, William H. Pauley III, said in a brief order.\nMr. Cohen\u2019s lawyers requested the delay, saying he recently had surgery and needed to undergo intensive physical therapy under the monitoring of his physician.\nThey also said Mr. Cohen anticipated being called at the end of the month to testify before three congressional committees, which have sought to question him about his work for Mr. Trump. The \u201csubstantial time\u201d he would need to prepare for the hearings, his lawyer, Michael D. Monico, wrote in a letter to the judge seeking the postponement, \u201cwill limit the time he has to get his affairs in order and spend time with his family.\u201d\nMr. Monico said on Wednesday that Mr. Cohen recently had shoulder surgery and that he and his legal team were \u201cvery happy\u201d the judge had granted his request and that the government did not oppose it.\nThe United States attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan declined to comment.\nMr. Monico said in a letter to the judge that the prosecutors did not object to a \u201cone-time 60-day extension\u201d of the proposed surrender date \u201cin light of Mr. Cohen\u2019s medical condition.\u201d\nMr. Cohen pleaded guilty in November to violating campaign finance laws, financial crimes and lying to Congress in two separate prosecutions, one brought by federal prosecutors in Manhattan and the other by the office of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election.\nAt his sentencing in December, Mr. Cohen apologized for his role in a hush-money scheme to buy the silence of an adult-film star and a former Playboy model who said they had affairs with Mr. Trump, in order to help Mr. Trump\u2019s election prospects.\n\u201cI blame myself for the conduct which has brought me here today,\u201d Mr. Cohen said in court before he was sentenced, \u201cand it was my own weakness and a blind loyalty to this man\u201d \u2014 referring to President Trump \u2014 \u201cthat led me to choose a path of darkness over light.\u201d\nJudge Pauley, at the request of Mr. Cohen\u2019s lawyers, has recommended that he serve his sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution in Otisville, N.Y., which is about 75 miles northwest of New York City.", "date": "Feb. 20, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/nyregion/michael-cohen-prison-sentence.html", "tags": "start sentence manhattan wins judge \u201d trump cohen prison federal order michael delay"}
