{"title": "Elizabeth Warren- Donald Trump Jr- Is Not 'Above The Law'", "content": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said Monday that President Donald Trump\u2019s eldest son Donald Trump Jr. should be held accountable if he defies a congressional subpoena\u00a0seeking information about his contacts with Russia.\n\u201cNo one is above the law, not even the son of the president of the United States,\u201d Warren, a Democratic presidential contender in the 2020 election, said at a teacher\u2019s union town hall in Philadelphia, according to video from The Hill.\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee subpoenaed Trump Jr. last week, seeking answers on whether he provided false or misleading testimony in 2017 about contacts with Russian officials during his father\u2019s campaign. In testimony earlier this year, Michael Cohen, his father\u2019s former attorney, contradicted the younger Trump\u2019s testimony.\nCohen claimed he briefed family members, including Trump Jr., multiple times on discussions involving a deal to construct a Trump Tower in Moscow during the 2016 campaign. But Trump Jr. claimed he had little knowledge of the project.\nTrump Jr. has been a key figure in the multiple investigations into his father\u2019s campaign and its ties to Russia. He met\u00a0with a Kremlin-linked lawyer at New York\u2019s Trump Tower in June 2016, seeking to obtain dirt on Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. He has repeatedly changed his story on the reason for the meeting.", "date": "\n05/14/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/elizabeth-warren-donald-trump-jr_n_5cdab672e4b0f7ba48ab0791", "tags": "jr. testimony jr- president trump elizabeth seeking donald campaign warren father warren- law"}
