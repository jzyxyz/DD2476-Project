{"title": "A Secretive Dinner Where $25,000 Buys Access to Cuomo (and Filet Mignon)", "content": "The rooftop fund-raiser was meant to be a secretive affair, but word spread quickly among those with pending issues before the state. Lobbyists told their clients that the event would be a good thing to go to. \nAfter all, the dinner was being held a little more than two weeks before the New York State budget was due, and what better way to make valuable connections than to pay tribute to the guest of honor, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo.\nAmong those present were the vice president of a school bus company seeking tax breaks for the purchase of buses; a recycling company founder looking for a broadening of the 5-cent deposit law; and an affordable housing developer lobbying for real estate tax credits. \nThe fund-raiser was held on March 14 on the 20th floor of the St. Regis Hotel, just off Fifth Avenue and a block from Trump Tower. The minimum donation per couple was $25,000. \nThe event, which was billed as a spring dinner with the governor, was strictly under the radar: It was not listed on Mr. Cuomo\u2019s calendar, and even the invitation was vaguely worded, with the locale only provided in the R.S.V.P.\nAnd although a reporter who showed up at the fund-raiser was barred entry, The New York Times was able to piece together an account of the event through interviews with six attendees and a partial guest list of 35 invitees. The guests included senior Cuomo administration officials, including the state budget director.\nThe fund-raiser provided a vivid example of how things work in Albany\u2019s pay-to-play culture, where political contributions are often viewed by business leaders as a prerequisite for getting their perspective heard in the capital. It also offered a glimpse into the nexus of money and politics that is commonplace across the ideological spectrum and around the United States, and something that Mr. Cuomo has excelled in. \nThe governor is considered one of the Democratic Party\u2019s most prolific fund-raisers, accumulating more than $30 million in his campaign war chest until last year\u2019s costly re-election effort, when he spent dearly to fend off a primary challenge from Cynthia Nixon. \nThe high-priced event seemed in stark contrast to Mr. Cuomo\u2019s promise of \u201creal campaign finance reform\u201d made two months earlier, as he announced his support for a public financing system. In January, the governor signed new limitations on corporate donations and, in his State of the State speech, vowed to \u201ccombat big money in politics\u201d and empower small donors.\nBut the vast majority of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s political fund-raising has come from big checks, and the event at the St. Regis, held in a room with a trompe l\u2019oeil of the sky on a partly cloudy day, continued that trend.\nCorey Muirhead is a vice president at Logan Bus Company and interim president of the New York School Bus Contractors Association. School bus contractors are lobbying the state on several issues of interest to their members, including tax exemptions for the purchase of new school buses. \n\u201cI coordinate with my lobbyist and I go to events that they feel are important,\u201d said Corey Muirhead of Logan Bus Company, who attended the dinner. \u201cWe have stuff that we want to see done up in Albany.\u201d\nRobert Mujica is the state budget director. He had been working out of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s Manhattan office on the day of the fund-raiser, the governor\u2019s staff said, and received an invitation as a matter of courtesy. \nAbout 100 people mingled in a crowd that included the state budget director, Robert Mujica, and the governor\u2019s top aide, Melissa DeRosa, before sitting down at more than a dozen tables for two slices of filet mignon, vegetables and what one attendee described as a \u201clittle peaked salad.\u201d \nAccording to the invitation, a limited number of tickets were available for $5,000; most single tickets were $15,000.\nThe governor delivered a speech that touched on Amazon, the tumult in Washington, and the transition from campaigning to governing that he said some new Albany legislators had to learn.\n\u201cI thought he gave a great speech. He really knew how to relate to the crowd,\u201d said Conrad Cutler, whose company, Galvanize Group, gathers bottles and cans and returns them to the distributors, collecting the deposit and a 3.5-cent handling fee. \u201cHe addressed a lot of pressing issues involving health care and the M.T.A. He underscored his commitment to New Yorkers who have issues.\u201d\nConrad Cutler is the chief executive of Galvanize Group, a company that collects cans and bottles to return them to distributors. Galvanize Group wants the state to approve an expansion of the bottle bill, which is backed by Mr. Cuomo and would make more bottles eligible for deposit. \nThirteen minutes before the fund-raiser officially began, Mr. Mujica emailed a statement to reporters, lashing out at the Democratic-led State Senate and accusing it of creating \u201cfalse political expectations\u201d with its budget proposals. \nThen the dinner started, with attendees sporting badges with two names: theirs and Mr. Cuomo\u2019s, the latter done up in his campaign logo.\n\u201cAs the governor said since Day 1, anyone who can get swayed by a single dollar has no place in government,\u201d Richard Azzopardi, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, said. He added that people who said their lobbyist told them to attend the fund-raiser should \u201cfire their lobbyist and get their head examined.\u201d\nMr. Azzopardi defended the presence of senior aides \u2014 including Mr. Mujica, who is in charge of the state budget being negotiated in Albany \u2014 at the fund-raiser, saying Mr. Mujica had \u201cworked out of his New York City office that day and this event was after hours.\u201d Staff members are routinely invited to events as guests, he added.\nMr. Cuomo, for his part, came from Albany for the event and was in the capital the next day, according to his public schedule.\nOne oddity at the fund-raiser? Neither attendees nor staff members from the Cuomo campaign could describe what office, if any, Mr. Cuomo, who was recently re-elected to a third term, was raising money for.\nNor could those contributing to him.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t ask. It\u2019s obvious what it is. It\u2019s the continual cycle of fund-raising,\u201d said John Samuelsen, the president of the Transport Workers Union International and an ally of the governor. \u201cThat\u2019s what he does. That\u2019s what everybody seems to do.\u201d\nJohn Samuelsen, whose name is misspelled on his badge, is the president of the Transport Workers Union International. The union, especially its Local 100, represents tens of thousands of public transit workers in the state-run Metropolitan Transportation Authority. \nMr. Samuelsen said he arrived just after the governor had finished his formal address. He said he spoke to the governor for a couple of minutes about the subway. Mr. Samuelsen, who recalled wearing a Woolrich shirt to the event, said he could not recall how much he had donated to attend. \n\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m not even in the weeds on that level,\u201d he said, adding that his union has happily long spent money to support Mr. Cuomo. \u201cThe governor has been the best governor for the trade union movement ever.\u201d\nThe roster of invitees included some well-known figures in New York real estate such as Douglas Durst; prominent political donors like the Republican billionaire John Catsimatidis; and past contributors to Mr. Cuomo like Elliot Gibber, who owns an egg products company and donated $73,000 to the governor\u2019s 2018 re-election campaign. \n\u201cI walked in and walked out,\u201d Mr. Gibber said. \u201cI have huge facilities in New York State. I believe in the governor. He\u2019s done a lot of work for education and private education.\u201d\nMr. Durst gave but did not attend; Mr. Catsimatidis said he did not contribute or go to the event, explaining the governor\u2019s invitation as a matter of their longstanding friendship.\n\u201cI go back with the governor 20 years,\u201d Mr. Catsimatidis said. \u201cIn 50 years in business, I have never gotten anything from the city or the state.\u201d \n\u201cYou know what I\u2019ve gotten? Ungatz,\u201d he said, of a slang term for nada, zip, zero. \u201cThat\u2019s Italian, I think.\u201d\nCharlie Bachtell is the founder and chief executive of Cresco Labs, a cannabis company based in Chicago. Mr. Cuomo has said he wanted to reach a deal on legalizing marijuana as part of the budget process, but he seems to have relented on the idea.\nOthers who bought tickets did so while they had an issue of importance to them being decided in Albany, like Larry Regan, a housing developer seeking real estate tax credits who did not go to the dinner, and Charlie Bachtell, the chief executive of Cresco Labs, a Chicago-based cannabis company.\nCresco Labs hired a lobbyist in New York for the first time this year, state records showed. Mr. Cuomo has said he wanted to reach an agreement on legalizing marijuana as part of the budget process, but he seems to have relented on that notion. \nA spokesman for the company declined to say why Mr. Bachtell had attended the fund-raiser. \nLarry Regan is the president of Regan Development, which develops market-rate and affordable housing. Mr. Regan has been lobbying the state on real estate tax credits. He paid for a ticket, but did not attend the event, a spokeswoman said. \nOthers with an immediate interest in state matters included Maury Litwack of the Teach Advocacy Network, a coalition of Jewish day schools and yeshivas that would like an increase in the reimbursement for science and math education at nonpublic schools. The week before the budget is passed could decide the size of that program.\n\u201cThe governor has been a champion of the STEM program and Jewish causes,\u201d Menashe Shapiro, a spokesman for Mr. Litwack, said. He said that while Mr. Litwack had briefly attended the end of the fund-raiser, \u201che did not write a check.\u201d \nMaury Litwack is the executive director of the Teach Advocacy Network, a coalition of Jewish day schools and yeshivas. The group wants the state to expand its STEM reimbursement program for nonpublic schools. \nMr. Muirhead, the bus company executive, said he attended in his role as interim president of the New York School Bus Contractors Association, which was lobbying the state government. He said a big issue for the group was a possible tax exemption on the purchase of new buses. \nMr. Cutler, the recycling executive, was also clear about his interest in the fund-raiser.\n\u201cGovernor Cuomo proposed to expand the bottle bill to all beverages except wine and liquor,\u201d he said, noting that the bill does not cover a few select categories, like milk. \u201cI agree with that because I make money on every bottle that\u2019s redeemed, and for environmental reasons.\u201d ", "date": "March 27, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/27/nyregion/cuomo-fundraiser-donors-lobbyists.html", "tags": "company dinner mignon buys \u201c fund-raiser new access secretive filet cuomo state governor said"}
