{"title": "Is This the Moment for Gun Control? A Gridlocked Congress Is Under Pressure", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Lawmakers will return to Washington on Monday facing intense public pressure to break their decades-long gridlock on gun control, a demand fortified by a bipartisan group of governors calling for Congress to take action to protect against mass shootings.\nBut even as members of both parties said it might be difficult for Congress to remain on the sidelines after the school massacre this month in Parkland, Fla., lawmakers have no clear consensus on even incremental changes to gun restrictions, let alone more sweeping legislation.\nOver a weeklong recess, Republican leaders in both the House and the Senate remained largely silent on gun legislation, a reflection of the significant obstacles to passing even modest measures this year.\nMany Republicans fear primary challenges from the right in the midterm elections this fall and do not want to be pushed into difficult votes. Democrats are not eager for legislation that they deem too incremental. And with lawmakers of both parties looking to wrap up their work to focus on their campaigns for re-election, the time to pass any significant legislation is running short.\nIf the past is prologue, Congress will do nothing.\nBut governors who gathered in Washington for their annual winter meeting warned of the perils of inaction. Animated by a wave of polling since the Florida massacre, Democratic governors warned that candidates would pay a political price for opposing new gun regulations, and some of their Republican counterparts conceded that the pleas of voters could no longer be ignored as they increasingly abandon the party.\n\u201cI think for Republicans our challenge in the next race is going to be about appealing to the suburban vote that hasn\u2019t been so good for Republicans the last few races,\u201d said Gov. Bill Haslam of Tennessee, citing in particular suburban women. It is clear, he added, that \u201cpeople want to see action.\u201d\nThe combination of political pressure from the governors and moves by President Trump to embrace certain limited measures opposed by the National Rifle Association could set up a congressional showdown with the powerful firearms lobby not seen since the gun debate that followed the deadly school shooting in 2012 in Newtown, Conn.\nThe sudden focus on guns is likely to complicate an already busy agenda. Congress left Washington without coming up with a replacement for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which protects hundreds of thousands of young immigrants from deportation and expires next week. A contentious debate over gun legislation could push immigration to the back burner.\nWhile the Newtown massacre and the many that have followed have produced familiar scenes in which Democrats push for tough new gun restrictions and Republicans dig in and resist, the latest mass shooting appears to have shifted the landscape, even if just slightly, as the Parkland students have become overnight gun control advocates and media fixtures.\nA smattering of congressional Republicans \u2014 including some who have been staunchly opposed to gun control legislation \u2014 now suggest that they would be willing to take at least small steps toward restricting gun rights.\nAfter being jeered at a forum televised on CNN, Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said last week that he would reconsider his opposition to limiting high-capacity magazines. Another Florida Republican, Representative Brian Mast, an Army veteran who lost both of his legs to a roadside bomb in Afghanistan, called for a ban on the purchase of assault weapons.\nGun control advocates are looking toward the changing political climate in Florida, where the Republican governor, Rick Scott, and state lawmakers defied the N.R.A. in proposing to raise to 21 the minimum age to buy any firearm.\nSenator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, is teaming up with Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, on legislation that would raise to 21 from 18 the age threshold for purchasing assault weapons like the AR-15 used to kill 17 people in Parkland.\nA poll released by CNN on Sunday, which showed support for stricter gun laws at levels not seen since the early 1990s, found that 71 percent of Americans backed barring those under 21 from buying any type of firearm.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if crossing the Rubicon is the right historical analogy, but there is a sense that this is different,\u201d Mr. Flake said, adding, \u201cWhere the public is and where some Republicans have been on some of these issues just doesn\u2019t match, and I do think we\u2019re going to have to deal with it.\u201d\nSenator Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas, a longtime ally of the N.R.A., has said he would back such an age-restriction proposal. \u201cCertainly nobody under 21 should have an AR-15,\u201d he told reporters in Kansas last week.\nMr. Flake, however, is not seeking re-election, and Mr. Roberts, 81, is unlikely to run again in 2020.\nAt the governors\u2019 meeting, there was agreement on the issue between Democrats and some Republicans. \u201cWe do it for alcohol; we\u2019re talking about raising the age for tobacco to 21,\u201d said Gov. Gary R. Herbert of Utah, a Republican. \u201cI think that\u2019s worth talking about.\u201d\nSenator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, said that with such talk among Republicans, \u201cthis feels like a watershed moment.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re seeing some significant and meaningful cracks in the bond that traditionally holds the Republican Party together,\u201d he said. \u201cThe question is: Are those cracks enough to get something done?\u201d\nGun rights advocates said the answer was no. \u201cThis, thus far, has shown no different a dynamic than any of a dozen fights over the past two decades,\u201d said Michael Hammond, legislative counsel for Gun Owners of America, which has fought gun control measures for decades. \u201cPeople who, after a week, suggest that this is a tipping point either weren\u2019t around during previous battles or failed to learn the lesson.\u201d\nSome Republicans, warning against a rush to enact new laws, appeared inclined to respect the wishes of the N.R.A., even as the group came under pressure from some corporate leaders, who were moving to cut ties with it.\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a temptation just to do a whole host of things that are not really addressing the fundamental problem but would make people feel better that they\u2019ve done things,\u201d said Gov. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, who has deep ties to the N.R.A., explaining his opposition to raising the age limit.\nRepresentative Thomas Massie, Republican of Kentucky and the chairman of the Congressional Second Amendment Caucus, warned that Republicans who had run for office on a platform that included protecting gun rights would face political consequences if they changed their tune.\n\u201cI suspect that a majority of Republicans are not going to turn on their base,\u201d Mr. Massie said.\nWhile such sentiment makes it unlikely that lawmakers will consider sweeping new gun restrictions, Congress is considering a number of more modest proposals.\nIn the House, 19 Republicans, led by Representative Leonard Lance of New Jersey, sent a letter on Friday to Speaker Paul D. Ryan, calling on him to schedule a vote on a measure that would require states and federal agencies to do a better job of reporting legal and mental health records to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS.\nBut the bill, called the Fix NICS Act, which is backed by the N.R.A. and Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican, is modest. It would not expand the number of gun sales subject to background checks, and it does nothing to close loopholes that allow guns to be sold over the internet, or at gun shows, without background checks on the purchasers.\nThe bill has already passed the House, but it was included in a broader measure that would permit the carrying of concealed firearms virtually anywhere in the country. That provision is a nonstarter in the Senate, which is why Mr. Lance and his colleagues are pushing for a stand-alone vote in the House.\nRepresentative Tom Reed, Republican of New York and a co-chairman of a bipartisan group of lawmakers known as the Problem Solvers Caucus, said his group planned to tackle the issue of mass shootings this week, with the hope of developing proposals that could become law.\nMr. Trump, who is a member of the N.R.A. and ran with its backing, has offered ideas of his own, spending much of last week promoting an N.R.A.-backed proposal to arm teachers.\nHe has also embraced \u201ccomprehensive background checks\u201d \u2014 without stating precisely what he means \u2014 as well as the proposals to raise the minimum age for buying assault weapons to 21. In addition, he has said he supports banning \u201cbump stocks,\u201d which convert semiautomatic guns into automatic weapons and were used last year by the gunman who mowed down concertgoers in Las Vegas.\nBut Representative Peter T. King, a New York Republican who said in an interview that he favors banning assault weapons \u2014 a major break with his party \u2014 called the proposed ban on bump stocks a \u201csmall step,\u201d and took issue with the age limit proposal. \u201cBy raising the minimum age from 18 to 21, then you\u2019re almost officially legalizing assault weapons,\u201d he said.\nIf the latest push for tighter gun restrictions has any better chance of success than the ones that came before, it is in large part a result of the fierce lobbying effort by the student advocates, including those from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, the site of this month\u2019s mass shooting.\n\u201cWe have a group of articulate and smart students who are also very angry and have been activated, and so they have captured the attention of our country, including members of Congress,\u201d said Mark Kelly, a founder of Giffords, an advocacy group named for his wife, former Representative Gabrielle Giffords, who was grievously wounded during a 2011 mass shooting in Tucson.\n\u201cCongress seems to have a hard time paying attention to important issues long enough to solve them, and they\u2019ll move on to the next thing,\u201d Mr. Kelly said. \u201cI don\u2019t think these kids are going to move on to the next thing.\u201d", "date": "Feb. 25, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/25/us/politics/gun-control-congress-governors.html", "tags": "gridlocked moment control gun \u201d republican republicans legislation pressure congress \u2014"}
