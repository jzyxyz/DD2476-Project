Those GOPers were Sens. Chuck Grassley (Iowa), Orrin Hatch (Utah), Lindsey Graham (S.C.), John Cornyn (Texas), Mike Lee (Utah), Ted Cruz (Texas), Ben Sasse (Neb.), Jeff Flake (Ariz.), Mike Crapo (Idaho), Thom Tillis (N.C.) and John Kennedy (La.).\nEvery Democrat voted against Vitter.\nDuring her April confirmation hearing, Vitter, 57, repeatedly avoided saying whether she still agrees with a May 2013 speech she gave in protest of a new Planned Parenthood clinic in New Orleans.\n\u201cPlanned Parenthood says they promote women\u2019s health,\u201d she said at the time, per New Orleans\u2019 Clarion Herald. \u201cIt is the saddest of ironies that they kill over 150,000 females a year. The first step in promoting women\u2019s health is to let them live.\u201d\nMany of Trump\u2019s court picks have records of being anti-abortion. Vitter, who is general counsel of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans and is married to former Sen. David Vitter (R-La.), has been pretty upfront about her background, too.\nBut her refusal to say whether she stands by her past comments didn\u2019t sit well with Democrats on the committee. It didn\u2019t help that she\u00a0failed to disclose that speech to the panel, along with other speeches she\u2019s given.\nVitter also didn\u2019t tell senators that she\u00a0moderated a panel at a 2013 anti-abortion conference\u00a0peddling false information about the dangers of abortion \u2015 or that she urged audience members to tell their doctors to put materials in their waiting rooms saying that abortions cause breast cancer, which is not true. Vice News uncovered these missing materials in March.\nOmitting details like this is a big no-no to senators on the committee, who expect a thorough submission of background materials for judicial nominees. It also at least creates the appearance of Vitter not wanting the panel to know about some of her controversial comments.\n\u201cAll I\u2019m looking for are judges that are fair and impartial,\u201d Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) said in Thursday\u2019s hearing. \u201cThey need to exhibit judgment, not to mention common sense. Ms. Vitter\u2019s public endorsement of these obvious falsehoods... and her urging of the audience to distribute materials containing such obvious lies shows she lacks the judgment for a lifetime appointment.\u201d\nVitter has also taken heat for not saying if she agreed with the landmark civil rights case that desegregated U.S. public schools, Brown v. Board of Education.\nHer nomination now heads to the Senate floor for a confirmation vote.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has been confirming Trump\u2019s judges at a breakneck pace\u00a0and has vowed to confirm every court nominee this year who makes it out of the judiciary committee.", "date": "\n05/24/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/wendy-vitter-abortion-trump-judge_n_5afd8918e4b06a3fb50e5c68", "tags": "planned females vitter court committee new advances \u201d materials senate year pick orleans parenthood said voted"}
