{"title": "An Iran Nuclear Deal Built on Coffee, All-Nighters and Compromise", "content": "LAUSANNE, Switzerland \u2014 It was just one of hundreds of arguments between American and Iranian officials as they tried to hash out what may prove to be one of the hardest-to-negotiate arms control agreements in history. But it spoke volumes about how two countries that so deeply distrust each other managed to strike a tentative deal.\nAfter President Obama revealed the existence of a secret, deep-underground enrichment operation near the sacred city of Qum in late 2009, the White House demanded that it be dismantled and closed. In defiance, the Iranians stuffed the facility, called Fordo, with 3,000 centrifuges \u2014 a huge issue for American and Israeli military planners because it is impervious to all but the largest bunker-buster bombs.\nIran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, also decreed that no nuclear facilities would be closed. So when negotiations turned to Fordo\u2019s fate, the Iranians insisted that the centrifuges had to stay and the Americans said they all had to come out.\nThe compromise \u2014 one of the most painful, an American official acknowledged on Thursday night \u2014 was that 1,000 centrifuges would remain. But they are to have no fissile material, the makings of a nuclear weapon.\nInstead, they will spin another element, for medical isotopes. Still, the official acknowledged the optics were bad: \u201cHaving even one centrifuge in Fordo is hard.\u201d\nAfter two years of secret diplomacy, then gradually accelerating engagement, then eight straight days and several all-nighters of negotiations this week in Lausanne, Switzerland \u2014 so intense that officials showed up at breakfast looking like they had just wandered off a 20-hour flight \u2014 the accord reached here on Thursday was filled with provisions like that.\nThe agreement calls for Tehran to slash its stockpile of nuclear materials and severely limit its enrichment activities, theoretically bringing the time it would take to produce a nuclear weapon to a year \u2014 a significant rollback from the current estimate of two to three months.\nBoth sides made significant compromises. For the United States, that meant accepting that Iran would retain its nuclear infrastructure in some shrunken form. For Iran, it meant severe limits on its production facilities and submitting to what Mr. Obama has called the most intrusive inspections regime in history.\nIt is still far too early to tell if the compromises will survive the next and final negotiating round, or review in Washington and Tehran. The timing of sanctions relief remains unresolved, for example, and already the two sides are describing it in different terms.\nBut the events of the last two years, and particularly the past week, offer some fascinating insights into what happens when two countries that have barely spoken with each other for 35 years \u2014 and have a long and troubled history of mistrust, sabotage, lies and violence \u2014 all but move into the same hotel room to try to figure out how they are going to get along.\nIt is fairly certain there will be a lot more wrangling in the next three months as the negotiators seek to wrap up a final, comprehensive treaty. That is because the negotiators left the Beau Rivage Hotel with astoundingly high bills \u2014 suites run more than $1,500 a night \u2014 but not an agreed-upon document detailing Iran\u2019s commitments and those of the United States and its negotiating partners.\nWherever Wendy Sherman, the lead American negotiator, traveled in the ornate hotel here, she was trailed by a whiteboard, where the Iranians and the Americans marked down their understandings, sometimes in both English and Persian.\nThe board served a major diplomatic purpose, letting both sides consider proposals without putting anything on paper. That allowed the Iranians to talk without sending a document back to Tehran for review, where hard-liners could chip away at it, according to several American officials interviewed for this article, who all spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.\n\u201cIt was a brilliantly low-tech solution,\u201d one White House official said. (It also had its drawbacks. One American wrote on it with a regular marker, then had to scrub hard to wipe out some classified numbers.)\nAnd it was far removed from the first year of Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency when, one of his top aides recalled a few years ago, there were more Situation Room meetings on Iran than any other topic. By the end of his first year in office, the president had come to some big conclusions.\nIf Iran got the bomb, classic \u201ccontainment\u201d would not work; the Sunni Arab states, starting with Saudi Arabia, would try to match the effort. Refusing to negotiate unless all the centrifuges stopped spinning, the strategy of the Bush administration, also seemed futile; Iran had a few hundred working centrifuges in 2003, thousands when Mr. Obama took over and 19,000 now.\nInsisting that Iran dismantle everything would not work, either; that would kill a negotiation before it started. And bombing would not work, at least not for very long. As William J. Burns, the deputy secretary of state who led the secret effort to establish relations with Iran\u2019s new president, Hassan Rouhani, put it recently: \u201cYou can\u2019t bomb knowledge. And there\u2019s nothing we could destroy that they couldn\u2019t rebuild in a few years.\u201d\nMr. Obama, by all accounts, immersed himself in the technical details, beginning with the giant centrifuge hall at Natanz, when he had to approve wave after wave of cyberattacks there. It was hoped that those attacks, combined with economic sanctions, would force Iran to see the folly of continuing on its path.\nBack then, the thinking was that Iran could have only a token production capability. Over time, though, the administration\u2019s objectives became less ambitious.\nAs the negotiations sputtered forward, it became clear that to reach an agreement at all, Iran would have to be able to preserve a narrative of not backing down, not dismantling.\nMr. Obama got deep into the technical compromises to political problems. He read briefings on three different proposals for how to convert a heavy-water reactor at Arak so that it could remain in operation without churning out plutonium waste that could be used in a bomb. He often delved into the workings of inspection regimes.\nBut as the talks hit one deadline after another, the administration had to compromise more. Instead of maintaining strict limits throughout the life of a 15-year accord, for example, it began to talk about keeping the toughest limits \u2014 the ones that would extend to a year the time Iran needed to produce enough nuclear material for a bomb \u2014 in place for at least 10 years.\nAs Secretary of State John Kerry prepared to return to the negotiations in Lausanne last month, the French were openly questioning whether he and his team were so invested in the deal that they might make unwise compromises in order to meet an artificial deadline at the end of March.\n\u201cYou hear that kind of stuff and you want to say, \u2018Why don\u2019t you sit at the table for months on end and see if you do any better?\u2019 \u201d one of Mr. Kerry\u2019s aides snapped when told of the critique.\nAs the talks grew more intense in the past two months, the Iranians decided to bring in their minister of atomic energy, prompting Mr. Obama to send Ernest Moniz, his energy secretary and one of the nation\u2019s leading nuclear scientists. This changed the dynamic. The two men set up a separate process and, as one senior administration official said, \u201cthey treated these matters as scientific problems.\u201d\nWith so many moving parts, Ms. Sherman, one of the most organized of diplomats, continued rolling out her whiteboards, a stark contrast with the elegance of the rooms they were meeting in at the Beau Rivage. But each issue that got crossed off seemed to be replaced by two more. Meetings went later and later.\nMr. Kerry was clearly feeling a bit caged: He went for bicycle rides three times (twice he had to return to take a call from the president). He went for crepes down the street and showed up at a bar to help celebrate the birthdays of some American reporters. Inside the negotiating rooms, an espresso machine constantly buzzed, as the Iranians and Americans tried to stay awake.\nBut when the deadline of March 31 came and went, quitting was not an option. \u201cThe trick was getting it to come together \u2014 you can see it, you see the deal,\u201d a senior administration official said. \u201cYou know what the elements are. But knocking it out is another thing altogether.\u201d\nThe Iranians knew the deadline meant a lot to Mr. Kerry \u2014 who needed to show progress to Congress \u2014 but it meant nothing to them. He, in turn, kept scheduling his departure, perhaps as a pressure tactic. His team deposited their luggage for loading onto the plane three times, only to find it returned hours later.\nAfter an all-night round of negotiations on Wednesday, his counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif, was asked how much sleep he got. \u201cTwo hours,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I was the lucky one.\u201d\nThe last tradeoffs were painful. When the Iranians insisted on keeping some centrifuges at Fordo, Mr. Obama approved the concession after Mr. Moniz assured him the facility, devoid of fissile material under the accord, would pose no threat. His credibility carried the day. And administration officials were struck by the fact that Iran was willing to waste 1,000 centrifuges, essentially spinning uselessly, to preserve national pride.\nThe same thing happened in finding a solution for the Arak heavy-water reactor, which they agreed to redesign. \u201cMoniz said this will not produce any weapons-grade plutonium,\u201d said a senior American official, and that if the Iranians cheated it would be detectable right away.\nAt the White House, Mr. Obama was pressing intelligence agencies for a report on the real intentions of Ayatollah Khamenei, who would cast the sole deciding vote on any deal in Iran. He never got a persuasive consensus: \u201cFrankly, that is almost unknowable,\u201d the official said.\nSome of the last issues were just punted to the next round, including the timetable for lifting sanctions and the specifics of how Iran will dispose of a large stockpile of uranium.\nComplicating things further, the Iranians did not want to publish a list of agreed upon points. So it was agreed that each side would put out its own \u2014 as long as they did not directly contradict each other.\nBut the two documents left room for differences. As Mr. Kerry stepped to the microphones on Thursday and talked about all the limits on Iran, and how some would last 15 years, others 25, a few for much longer, Mr. Zarif had a different spin.\n\u201cWe will continue enriching, we will continue research and development, our heavy water reactor will be modernized, and our facility in Fordo will remain open,\u201d he said.", "date": "April 3, 2015", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/04/world/middleeast/an-iran-nuclear-deal-built-on-coffee-all-nighters-and-compromise.html", "tags": "all-nighters iran mr. nuclear compromise \u201d one iranians obama two coffee built deal \u2014"}
