{"title": "Putin Swaggers Into Hungary as Europe Wonders About U.S.", "content": "BUDAPEST \u2014 When President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia last paid a visit to Hungary, Prime Minister Viktor Orban was under siege for his autocratic style, Russia was isolated for its seizure of Crimea, and both men were called xenophobes for their hard-line stance on immigration.\nTwo years later, as Mr. Putin landed on Thursday for his first foray into Europe in the Trump era, it was a different story. Both men feel vindicated. There is talk of lifting the economic sanctions placed on Russia for its land grab in Ukraine. Their brand of nationalism has moved from the fringe to the mainstream.\nThere was a note of triumphalism, even a bit of swagger, in the air.\n\u201cWe all sense, it\u2019s in the air, that the world is in the process of a substantial realignment,\u201d Mr. Orban said in a news conference after Thursday\u2019s meeting. \u201cWe believe this will create favorable conditions for stronger Russian-Hungarian relations.\u201d\nEven so, beneath the triumph lies a strain of uneasiness. The visit is expected to be fairly low-key, an indication of the uncertainty surrounding the new Trump administration, analysts say. President Trump\u2019s intentions remain unclear, and the prospects of a grand bargain between Washington and the Kremlin are highly uncertain.\nIn the meantime, leaders across Europe have been forced to recalculate the best way to balance pressures in the East and West. Nowhere is that challenge felt more keenly than in Central and Eastern Europe, historically torn between Russia and the West.\nThat means European and global leaders are closely scrutinizing the visit. They are looking for hints of how aggressive Mr. Putin and populist leaders like Mr. Orban will be in capitalizing on this new international climate and on Mr. Trump\u2019s stated desire for better relations with Moscow.\nIf Thursday\u2019s post-meeting news conference is any indication, any hints of aggression are well buried. Both leaders focused on economic issues, such as Russian energy deals, and emphasized the need for international cooperation.\n\u201cI provided information in great detail on our assessment of what is happening in eastern Ukraine and what, in our opinion, is happening in Syria,\u201d Mr. Putin said \u2014 which, he added, underlines the need for more global cooperation to fight terrorism.\nMany here, skeptical that the Americans and Russians will actually bridge the chasm of interests dividing them, are injecting a note of caution about the balancing act ahead for leaders like Mr. Orban and his governing right-wing party, Fidesz.\nAndras Racz, a Russia expert and associate professor at Pazmany Peter Catholic University in Budapest, predicted that the reset in relations between the United States and Russia would result in \u201ca brief honeymoon, but nothing else, soon overwritten by conflicting interests.\u201d\nAs for Hungary, \u201cthere is no trust on the Russian side towards Orban,\u201d Mr. Racz said. The Hungarian leader has been seen mostly as a useful tool for weakening European Union unity, he said.\nAnd the feeling is mutual, said Balazs Orban, director of research for the Szazadveg Foundation, a think tank that advises the Fidesz party.\n\u201cFidesz doesn\u2019t feel chemistry with the Russians,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t think they are friends of Hungary, necessarily.\u201d\nThe warmer relations of recent years, he said, had more to do with economic necessity and Hungary\u2019s dependence on Russian energy.\nIndeed, Zoltan Kovacs, Viktor Orban\u2019s spokesman, said in an interview that both nations would treat Mr. Putin\u2019s visit as \u201cbusiness as usual,\u201d with energy policy and a Russian deal to build a nuclear power plant in Hungary at the top of the agenda.\nIt was not clear how significant a role, if any, the thorniest issue between Russia and the West \u2014 the sanctions imposed by the European Union and the United States after the seizure of Crimea \u2014 would play in the meeting. But Mr. Putin is clearly eager to have the sanctions lifted, and to sow divisions in the European Union on that policy and others.\nHungary may be among the nations most susceptible to Mr. Putin\u2019s maneuvering to remove the sanctions. Mr. Orban has voted with other European nations to support them, as a show of solidarity.\nWhen Hungary\u2019s foreign minister, Peter Szijjarto, visited Moscow last week to prepare for Mr. Putin\u2019s visit, he described the sanctions as \u201ccounterproductive and harmful\u201d: an indicator, some thought, of weakening Hungarian resolve.\nBut since then, Mr. Trump has said that it is \u201ctoo early\u201d to revisit the issue, but that he remains open to easing sanctions down the road. In separate phone conversations he had last weekend with Mr. Putin and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who strongly supports the sanctions, the subject did not even come up.\nAnd that pattern held on Thursday, when neither leader mentioned the word \u201csanctions\u201d in their public statements.\nMr. Orban, though, did allude to the sanctions, saying that some nations in \u201cthe western side of the Continent have shown very anti-Russian policies,\u201d which have harmed the Hungarian economy \u201cfor reasons which are beyond us.\u201d\nMr. Orban\u2019s hosting of Mr. Putin is the first part of a busy year of global outreach. Efforts are underway to arrange a meeting with Mr. Trump \u2014 the timing and location are still under discussion \u2014 and Mr. Orban is also planning a visit to Beijing and a meeting with Turkey\u2019s increasingly autocratic leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\u201cOrban has collected some credits in the international sphere,\u201d said Balazs Orban, the researcher, who is not related to the prime minister. \u201cHe forecast everything correctly, like immigration.\u201d\nNow, seeing a potential ally in Washington to balance the one in Moscow, the prime minister intends to cash those credits.\n\u201cHe understands geopolitics is changing,\u201d Balazs Orban said: The notion that all nations need to embrace globalism and \u201cthe liberal world order\u201d is no longer automatically accepted.\nThe Hungarian prime minister\u2019s chief opposition comes from the far-right Jobbik Party. Its leader, Gabor Vona, said in an interview this week that he had \u201cvery mixed feelings about Donald J. Trump\u2019s election,\u201d and that he was unsure how seriously to take Mr. Trump\u2019s talk. He said he would wait \u201cto see what will be unfurled.\u201d\nRussia has been accused of backing fringe parties in an effort to destabilize the European Union and NATO, but Mr. Vona denied persistent rumors that Jobbik received money from the Kremlin, calling it government propaganda.\nNevertheless, Mr. Vona said Jobbik would welcome a grand bargain between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin.\n\u201cWe will only be happy if relations between the U.S. and Russia improve,\u201d he said. If that bargain includes the creation of new \u201cspheres of influence\u201d for Russia and the West, as Mr. Putin dearly wishes, so much the better.\nIn such a world, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman, Mr. Kovacs, made clear that Hungary would be working for more latitude to pursue its own interests, even while staying in the European Union.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to step out of the European Union,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to reform it,\u201d turning it from a \u201cUnited States of Europe\u201d into an alliance of more independent, sovereign nations whose leaders can govern without what Mr. Kovacs characterized as undue influence from the organization\u2019s bureaucrats in Brussels.\n\u201cAt the same time, we all sense there is going to be a resetting of the relationship with Moscow, and Hungary would like to be there,\u201d Mr. Kovacs said. \u201cIt is not a bipolar world anymore. It is a multipolar world that is emerging.\u201d", "date": "Feb. 2, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/world/europe/vladimir-putin-hungary.html", "tags": "sanctions \u201c hungary orban europe u.s wonders swaggers russia said putin"}
