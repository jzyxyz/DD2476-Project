{"title": "The Paris Climate Deal: What You Need to Know", "content": "President Trump announced Thursday that he would pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord. The decision makes good on a campaign promise and aligns with Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d message. It is also a major setback for the worldwide effort to combat global warming.\nWhat does the decision mean? We have extensive coverage here at The New York Times, but it is a complex issue and you may be wondering where to start.\nIn December 2015, nearly every country in the world \u2014 195 in all \u2014 agreed to the first global pact aimed at reducing emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases. It was a landmark diplomatic achievement and the pinnacle of President Barack Obama\u2019s environmental agenda.\nScientific studies show that if the world\u2019s carbon emissions continue unchecked, atmospheric temperatures will continue to rise. The planet won\u2019t just be hotter, but it will also suffer from rising sea levels, more powerful storms, droughts that lead to food shortages and other extreme conditions.\nThe idea of the Paris climate accord was that every country, rich and poor, would set goals to curb carbon emissions in an effort to avert the worst effects of climate change.\n\u2022 Our climate explainer-in-chief, Brad Plumer, has written a Q. & A. on the Paris accord so you can understand it better.\n\u2022 Our article from when the agreement was reached in 2015 is a good overview of the agreement and what\u2019s at stake.\n\u2022 Need some convincing on global warming? Well, 2016 broke the record for hottest year. As did 2015. As did 2014.\nThe president has called climate change a hoax, and he pledged during the campaign to \u201ccancel\u201d the Paris deal. Few expected him to announce that the United States would remain committed to the pact.\nMr. Trump is now making clear his belief that joint global action on climate change is antagonistic to his \u201cAmerica first\u201d message and could be harmful to the economy. Environmental advocates dispute the argument that the Paris accord would cost jobs.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, the United States cannot exit until Nov. 4, 2020 \u2014 the day after the next presidential election. That could make climate change a future campaign issue.\n\u2022 Our White House reporter Michael D. Shear is tracking the latest developments in our lead story.\n\u2022 Most Americans say the United States should participate in the Paris accord. But as Peter Baker writes, Mr. Trump is betting once again on his political base.\n\u2022 Mr. Trump cited some dubious data during his speech in the White House Rose Garden. But he didn\u2019t seem to be questioning climate change \u2014 only the economic burdens of the climate deal.\n\u2022 Cities, states, universities and businesses are trying to fill the void left by Mr. Trump\u2019s withdrawal.\nWhile Americans make up just over 4 percent of the world\u2019s population, they are responsible for almost a third of the excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. China emits more carbon into the atmosphere today, but as our climate reporter Justin Gillis explains, the United States has a long head start on burning coal, oil and natural gas. Some said it was a moral imperative for the United States to stay in the Paris pact.\nBut since Mr. Trump has decided to leave, other countries \u2014 especially the poorer ones \u2014 could consider doing the same. That could reverse years of hard-won progress on climate change.\nThe United States will join Nicaragua and Syria as the only countries that are not a part of the Paris agreement.\n\u2022 Here is Justin\u2019s must-read news analysis.\n\u2022 Mr. Trump is creating a vacuum of global leadership, David E. Sanger and Jane Perlez write, and China may be the biggest beneficiary. China said Thursday that it was committed to the Paris goals no matter what Mr. Trump did.\n\u2022 Americans themselves overwhelmingly believe that global warming is happening, and that carbon emissions should be scaled back. But there\u2019s a catch.\nThe red line shows what will happen to carbon emissions without the Paris agreement: up, up, up. The United States\u2019 contribution to the emissions goal was substantial. But other countries have pledged to continue their programs with or without American participation.\n\u2022 This graphic by Jasmine C. Lee and Adam Pearce walks through the possibilities.\n\u2022 For the ultimate visual experience, be sure to see our recent Antarctica series.\n\u2022 And if you\u2019re wondering what you can do about climate change on your own, we have a guide.", "date": "June 1, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/01/climate/paris-climate-change-guide.html", "tags": "need know \u2022 united states global climate change \u2014 deal paris"}
