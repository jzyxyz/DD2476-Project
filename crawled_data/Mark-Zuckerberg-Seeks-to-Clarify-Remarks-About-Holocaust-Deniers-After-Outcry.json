{"title": "Mark Zuckerberg Seeks to Clarify Remarks About Holocaust Deniers After Outcry", "content": "Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook chief executive, said in an interview published Wednesday that he would not automatically remove denials that the Holocaust took place from the site, a remark that caused an uproar online.\nMr. Zuckerberg\u2019s comments were made during an interview with the tech journalist Kara Swisher that was published on the site Recode. (Read the full transcript here.) Hours later, Mr. Zuckerberg tried to clarify his comments in an email to Recode.\nIn the interview, Mr. Zuckerberg had been discussing what content Facebook would remove from the site, and noted that in countries like Myanmar and Sri Lanka, the dissemination of hate speech can have immediate and dire consequences. Moments earlier, he had also defended his company\u2019s decision to allow content from the conspiracy site Infowars to be distributed on Facebook.\n[Facebook plans to remove misinformation that could lead to physical harm.]\n\u201cThe principles that we have on what we remove from the service are: If it\u2019s going to result in real harm, real physical harm, or if you\u2019re attacking individuals, then that content shouldn\u2019t be on the platform,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of categories of that that we can get into, but then there\u2019s broad debate.\u201d\nMs. Swisher, who will become an Opinion contributor with The New York Times later this summer, challenged Mr. Zuckerberg.\n\u201c\u2018Sandy Hook didn\u2019t happen\u2019 is not a debate,\u201d she said, referring to the Connecticut school massacre in 2012, which Infowars has spread conspiracy theories about. \u201cIt is false. You can\u2019t just take that down?\u201d\nMr. Zuckerberg countered that the context of the remark mattered.\n\u201cI also think that going to someone who is a victim of Sandy Hook and telling them, \u2018Hey, no, you\u2019re a liar\u2019 \u2014 that is harassment, and we actually will take that down,\u201d he said.\nThat\u2019s when Mr. Zuckerberg brought up the Holocaust.\n\u201cBut over all, let\u2019s take this whole closer to home,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019m Jewish, and there\u2019s a set of people who deny that the Holocaust happened. I find that deeply offensive. But at the end of the day, I don\u2019t believe that our platform should take that down because I think there are things that different people get wrong. I don\u2019t think that they\u2019re intentionally getting it wrong.\u201d\nMs. Swisher interrupted him: \u201cIn the case of the Holocaust deniers, they might be, but go ahead.\u201d\nMr. Zuckerberg\u2019s response was somewhat muddled.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to impugn intent and to understand the intent,\u201d he said, adding that he also gets things wrong when he speaks publicly, and other public figures do as well.\n\u201cI just don\u2019t think that it is the right thing to say, \u2018We\u2019re going to take someone off the platform if they get things wrong, even multiple times,\u2019\u201d he said.\nInstead, Facebook would allow the content to exist on its site, but would move it down in the News Feed so that fewer users see it, he said.\nIn his follow-up statement, the Facebook chief executive tried to clarify his remarks.\n\u201cThere\u2019s one thing I want to clear up. I personally find Holocaust denial deeply offensive, and I absolutely didn\u2019t intend to defend the intent of people who deny that,\u201d he wrote in the email.\n\u201cIf something is spreading and is rated false by fact checkers, it would lose the vast majority of its distribution,\u201d he wrote, adding that any post \u201cadvocating for violence or hate against a particular group\u201d would be removed.\n\u201cThese issues are very challenging,\u201d he added, \u201cbut I believe that often the best way to fight offensive bad speech is with good speech.\u201d\nBut the interview had already set off a reaction from online commenters and drew widespread news coverage.\nBenjy Sarlin of NBC News seemed baffled by Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s choice of words.\nJonathan Greenblatt, the chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, said in a statement that Holocaust denial is \u201ca willful, deliberate and longstanding deception tactic by anti-Semites.\u201d\n\u201cFacebook has a moral and ethical obligation not to allow its dissemination,\u201d he wrote.", "date": "July 18, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/18/technology/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-holocaust-denial.html", "tags": "site mr. take seeks holocaust remarks deniers outcry \u201d facebook mark clarify zuckerberg"}
