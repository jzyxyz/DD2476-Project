{"title": "'Game Of Thrones' Finally Reveals Jon Snow's Real Name", "content": "Jon Snow is \u201cJon Snow\u201d no more.\nAfter last season of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d confirmed the character was actually born to Lyanna Stark,\u00a0Sunday\u2019s episode, titled \u201cThe Dragon and the Wolf,\u201d\u00a0finally made Jon\u2019s (Kit Harington) true given name known to viewers. For those fans who started with George R.R. Martin\u2019s book series, it\u2019s a revelation 20 years in the making.\nHe Who Knows Nothing is really named Aegon Targaryen, reflecting his actual ancestry. (Our vote,\u00a0\u201cJon Starkaryen,\u201d was apparently not taken into consideration.)\nWhile last season confirmed Lyanna as Jon\u2019s mother, his father\u2019s identity is now confirmed to be Rhaegar Targaryen, brother to Daenerys (Emilia Clarke) and heir to the Mad King\u2019s throne \u2015 before the Targaryen dynasty was toppled.\n\u201cAegon\u201d was the name of Aegon the Conqueror, the first Targaryen ruler in Westeros, and also the name of Rhaegar\u2019s other son,\u00a0who died in the Sack of King\u2019s Landing (at least in the books).\u00a0This also means Rhaegar may have named two of his sons Aegon, for some reason.\nIn order to protect his orphaned nephew after Lyanna\u2019s death, Ned Stark (Sean Bean) claimed Jon as his own bastard son, giving him the traditional surname of Northern bastards and a ho-hum first name, as if to say,\u00a0Nothing to see here! No Targaryen blood in this kid.\u00a0At the time, Robert Baratheon (Mark Addy) was intent on killing off surviving Targaryen family members to secure his claim to the Iron Throne. If Jon\u2019s true bloodline had been discovered, it would have put him in a lot of danger, even as Ned\u2019s own nephew. Robert loved Lyanna, whom he intended to marry, and he hated Rhaegar for running away with her.\nIn any case,\u00a0the truth about Jon\u2019s heritage is likely to be a game-changer, especially because\u00a0his parents were married. While being a bastard outsider has been such an integral part of Jon\u2019s identity throughout his life, we now know\u00a0that he\u2019s the legitimate son of Lyanna and Rhaegar.\nGilly (Hannah Murray) nearly confirmed Rhaegar and Lyanna were married earlier in Season 7, but was frustratingly cut off before she could say Lyanna\u2019s name. This time, it was Sam (John Bradley) and Bran (Isaac Hempstead-Wright) who uncovered the truth.\u00a0\nAlthough the Northern lords overlooked Jon\u2019s status as a Stark bastard when they named him their king, discovering he\u2019s Aegon Targaryen might cause some problems. After all, the North fought against the Targaryens with Robert and Ned.\nHis relationship with Dany (Emilia Clarke) may also turn awkward. Despite their supposed similar ages, she is Jon\u2019s aunt \u2015 although the Targaryens famously wed close relations for centuries.\nBut Jon is technically the rightful ruler of the Seven Kingdoms, as the true-born son of Rhaegar Targaryen, who was next in line to the Iron Throne under the Targaryen dynasty. Considering how much of Dany\u2019s identity has been tied to her claim to the Iron Throne, she probably won\u2019t take the news all that well. Jon, though, has repeatedly expressed his reluctance to lead, so he may simply be uninterested in the country\u2019s ultimate leadership position. Besides, he just recently bent the knee to give up his status as King in da Norf.\nWith the living occupants of Westeros gearing up to face the fight of their lives \u2015 or rather, the fight for their lives \u2015 we hope they keep their eye on the ball, joining forces, destroying White Walkers, saving the continent and living happily ever after.\u00a0But, you know, they probably won\u2019t.", "date": "\n08/27/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/game-of-thrones-reveals-jon-starkaryen_n_599da804e4b0a296083ba0a6", "tags": "name snow targaryen confirmed finally \u201d real jon aegon king reveals thrones rhaegar lyanna"}
