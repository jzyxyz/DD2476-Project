{"title": "Trump Faces Fury After Saying He Believes North Korean Leader on Student\u2019s Death", "content": "After the American college student Otto Warmbier was released from a North Korea prison in 2017, unresponsive and not expected to survive, his father, Fred, spoke of a comforting phone call from President Trump: \u201cIt was gracious, it was nice and it felt good.\u201d\nDuring Mr. Trump\u2019s State of the Union address in 2018, Fred Warmbier and his wife, Cindy, stood and wept while Mr. Trump spoke of the \u201cmenace\u201d of North Korea and gave tribute to their son, who died days after his release.\nOn Friday, the Warmbiers emerged into the public eye again, this time with a blistering statement directed at the president. They said they could no longer be silent after the summit meeting this week with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, and after hearing Mr. Trump say that he believed Mr. Kim\u2019s claim that he did not know what had happened to Mr. Warmbier while he was in custody.\n\u201cWe have been respectful during this summit process,\u201d the Warmbiers said in a statement. \u201cNow we must speak out. Kim and his evil regime are responsible for the death of our son Otto. Kim and his evil regime are responsible for unimaginable cruelty and inhumanity. No excuses or lavish praise can change that.\u201d\nThe outrage went far beyond the Warmbiers, as American political leaders, including members of Mr. Trump\u2019s own party, joined the family in condemning Mr. Kim for Mr. Warmbier\u2019s death.\n\u201cAmericans know, the world knows, Kim Jong-un knows, and most importantly, the Warmbier family knows that Otto suffered a cruel death inflicted by a brutal regime serving Kim Jong-un,\u201d Representative Warren Davidson, Republican of Ohio, said on Twitter.\nMr. Trump has grown increasingly effusive about Mr. Kim since the days, early in the administration, when he referred to the dictator as \u201cLittle Rocket Man\u201d and threatened to rain \u201cfire and fury\u201d upon North Korea. \u201cOur relationship is a very special relationship,\u201d he told reporters this week before the summit meeting broke up. And at a rally in September, the president boasted that Mr. Kim \u201cwrote me beautiful letters.\u201d\n\u201cAnd they\u2019re great letters,\u201d he said. \u201cWe fell in love.\u201d\nFor the Warmbiers, who found an ally in Mr. Trump as the president helped secure the release of their son, it was a striking turnabout.\nIn late 2015, Mr. Warmbier was an adventure-seeking University of Virginia student on a five-day tour of North Korea. As he tried to leave the country, he was detained at the Pyongyang airport, accused of stealing a propaganda poster and sentenced to 15 years of hard labor. He was returned to the United States in June 2017 with a catastrophic brain injury, and he died at the age of 22.\nMr. Trump said in 2017 that Mr. Warmbier was \u201ctortured beyond belief by North Korea.\u201d\nBut in the aftermath of the summit in Hanoi, the Vietnamese capital, this week between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim, Mr. Trump said that the two leaders discussed Mr. Warmbier, and that Mr. Trump believed Mr. Kim was ignorant of what was happening to Mr. Warmbier while he was imprisoned.\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that he would have allowed that to happen; it just wasn\u2019t to his advantage to allow that to happen,\u201d Mr. Trump said afterward. \u201cThose prisons are rough \u2014 they\u2019re rough places \u2014 and bad things happened. But I really don\u2019t believe that he \u2014 I don\u2019t believe that he knew about it.\u201d\n\u201cHe tells me that he didn\u2019t know about it,\u201d Mr. Trump also said, \u201cand I will take him at his word.\u201d\nJust as the Warmbier family\u2019s plight aroused sympathy around the world after Mr. Warmbier\u2019s 17-month imprisonment, his parents\u2019 statement on Friday was echoed by words of support from a chorus of elected officials in Ohio.\nSenator Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat, said in an email: \u201cNorth Korea murdered Otto Warmbier and the president of the United States has a responsibility to make sure they face the consequences. Anything short of that is unacceptable.\u201d\nIn the Warmbiers\u2019 hometown \u2014 Wyoming, Ohio, an affluent enclave of 8,500 people that borders Cincinnati \u2014 their neighbors, friends and acquaintances said they were aghast that Mr. Trump appeared to be taking the side of Mr. Kim, a dictator and authoritarian known for his willingness to torture and execute political enemies.\n\u201cEverybody both loves that family and sympathizes completely with the circumstances they\u2019ve had to deal with,\u201d Jenni McCauley, a Wyoming councilwoman.\nMr. Warmbier was an outstanding young man, she said, eager to travel and curious to explore the world.\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a sad thing that Trump said anything in regard to it,\u201d Ms. McCauley said. \u201cWe wish he had not said anything.\u201d\nFounded in 1805, Wyoming boasts century-old, well-kept homes and a tidy downtown with mom-and-pop businesses and a village green park. The area, which is part of Hamilton County, leans Democratic, residents said. Trees and streetlamps that had been wrapped in blue-and-white ribbons in support of Mr. Warmbier at the time of his release stood bare on Friday.\nWhen school let out, students spilled out from a campus on foot and filled local coffee shops and bakeries.\nPatty Pfahler, 59, the owner of a home furnishing store in Wyoming, said that she felt conflicted by the president\u2019s remarks. They \u201cfelt sour and reopened old wounds,\u201d Ms. Pfahler said, but she also suggested they might be an effort at international diplomacy.\nAt a coffee shop in town, one employee, Kate Nicholson, 42, said that hearing Mr. Trump say what he did about Mr. Kim \u201cmade my stomach hurt.\u201d\nDarren Wilson, 47, a resident of Wyoming, questioned whether Mr. Kim could really have been ignorant of Mr. Warmbier\u2019s condition while he was imprisoned.\n\u201cI find it hard to believe that someone who runs a country where the people are so oppressed would not know what is going on with someone like Otto,\u201d Mr. Wilson said. \u201cI don\u2019t personally believe it.\u201d\nSherry Sheffield, Wyoming\u2019s unofficial historian, said that residents of the town have tried to give the family privacy to grieve since their son died. \u201cI have heard other people say they\u2019re doing O.K.,\u201d she said. Of the family\u2019s decision to speak out, Ms. Sheffield said, \u201cthey\u2019re really in this to make sure that people understand what happened.\u201d\nThe Warmbiers filed a federal lawsuit last year in the United States against the autocratic government, and they were awarded over $501 million in damages, though it is unlikely that they would receive the full amount from North Korea.\nNo one answered the door at the Warmbiers\u2019 home on Friday afternoon.\nMr. Trump said on Twitter on Friday that his remarks had been \u201cmisinterpreted.\u201d\n\u201cOf course I hold North Korea responsible for Otto\u2019s mistreatment and death,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI love Otto and think of him often!\u201d", "date": "March 1, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/01/us/trump-otto-warmbier-north-korea.html", "tags": "faces saying \u201c korean death north trump otto student warmbier leader kim fury believes korea said"}
