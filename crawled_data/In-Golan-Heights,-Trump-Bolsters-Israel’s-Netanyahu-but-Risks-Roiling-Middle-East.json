{"title": "In Golan Heights, Trump Bolsters Israel\u2019s Netanyahu but Risks Roiling Middle East", "content": "President Trump declared on Thursday that the United States should recognize Israel\u2019s authority over the long disputed Golan Heights, delivering a valuable election-eve gift to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu but jettisoning decades of American policy in the Middle East.\nMr. Trump\u2019s announcement, in a midday Twitter post, came after persistent pressure from Mr. Netanyahu, a close political ally who is fighting for his survival in the election scheduled for April 9, and has invoked his friendship with the American president as a prime argument for staying in office.\nBut Mr. Trump\u2019s move, while popular in Israel and among some lawmakers in Congress, is likely to be condemned almost everywhere else. The United Nations has rejected Israel\u2019s occupation of the Golan Heights since 1967, when Israeli troops seized the 400 square miles of rocky highlands from Syria during the Arab-Israeli war.\n[Sign up for the weekly At War newsletter to receive stories about conflict and consequence.]\nIt will also reverberate throughout the Middle East and could undermine Mr. Trump\u2019s long anticipated peace proposal for Israel and the Palestinians. The White House has been enlisting support for the plan among Arab leaders who now face the prospect of acquiescing in the loss of land they had long claimed as Arab.\nAs a practical matter, Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement changes little. There is no negotiation underway on the status of the Golan Heights, nor any expectation that Israel is going to withdraw from it. The United States could veto any United Nations Security Council resolution condemning the move.\nBut as a symbolic step, the decision is momentous \u2014 underlining Mr. Trump\u2019s willingness to flout diplomatic orthodoxy and shake up a debate over the Middle East that has changed little since the 1970s.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about doing that for a long time,\u201d Mr. Trump said to Fox Business Network in an interview scheduled to air on Friday. \u201cEvery president has said \u2018do that,\u2019\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m the one that gets it done.\u201d\nMr. Trump brushed aside suggestions that he was trying to help Mr. Netanyahu in the election, professing to be only vaguely aware of the Israeli leader\u2019s political challenges. He plans to welcome Mr. Netanyahu to the White House next Monday.\n[Read a brief history of the Golan Heights.]\nYet unlike the president\u2019s earlier decision to move the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which was mandated by Congress and fulfilled a promise he made during the 2016 presidential campaign \u2014 one made by previous presidential candidates \u2014 this latest move was both a first for an American president and almost purely a gesture to Mr. Netanyahu.\nThe Israeli leader welcomed it as such during a meeting in Jerusalem with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\u201cPresident Trump has just made history,\u201d said a beaming Mr. Netanyahu, who said he called the president to thank him on behalf of the Israeli people after his tweet. \u201cHe did it again.\u201d\nPraising Mr. Trump for moving the embassy and for withdrawing the United States from the Iran nuclear deal, which Mr. Netanyahu stridently opposed, the prime minister said, \u201cThe message that President Trump has given the world is that America stands by Israel.\u201d\nMr. Netanyahu called it \u201ca miracle of Purim,\u201d referring to an ancient Jewish holiday being celebrated this week.\nPalestinian officials, who have been alienated from the Trump administration since it moved the American Embassy to Jerusalem, predicted that the latest move would ignite a new wave of violence in the region.\n\u201cWhat shall tomorrow bring?\u201d Saeb Erekat, a veteran Palestinian Authority peace negotiator, said in a tweet. \u201cCertain destabilisation and bloodshed in our region.\u201d\nThe announcement was the latest in a series of steps that have radically reshaped the United States\u2019 role in the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians \u2014 overwhelmingly to the benefit of Israel\u2019s right-wing government.\nThe president cast his decision as being of \u201ccritical and strategic importance to the State of Israel.\u201d Other administration officials and defenders of the policy, including Republican senators, said that Israel\u2019s control of the Golan Heights was critical, with Hezbollah and other Iranian-backed militants threatening it from inside war-torn Syria.\nIn Jerusalem, Mr. Pompeo appeared caught off guard by the timing of Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet. Hours earlier, Mr. Pompeo told journalists that the United States\u2019 longstanding policy on the Golan Heights had not changed. He then visited the Western Wall with Mr. Netanyahu \u2014 the first time that an American cabinet official had done so with an Israeli prime minister.\nAfter the announcement, the two showed up nearly an hour late for a news conference, during which Mr. Pompeo called Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to recognize Israeli sovereignty a tribute to Israel\u2019s warriors. The tank battle that opened the way to Israel\u2019s seizure of the Golan Heights was a testament to \u201camazing Israeli bravery,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said, adding that he had studied it as a West Point cadet.\nStill, Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement puts him at odds with international law and decades of American policy.\nThe United Nations and the United States have steadfastly refused to recognize Israel\u2019s seizure of the Golan Heights or the West Bank, arguing that the contours of Israel and a new Palestinian state must be negotiated diplomatically. In 1981, when Israel effectively annexed the Golan Heights, the Reagan administration retaliated by suspending a strategic cooperation agreement between the United States and Israel.\nIsrael, however, has continued to administer the territory as part of its country, and the Jewish population there has grown with the expansion of Israeli settlements. Since the outbreak of war in Syria in 2011, and the intervention of Iran and Russia, there has been little international pressure on Israel to pull out of land widely viewed as critical to its security.\nFormer diplomats said Mr. Trump\u2019s action was unnecessary and would inflame an issue that had been largely dormant. They also said it would embolden other world leaders who seized territory in violation of international norms.\n\u201cPutin will use this as a pretext to justify Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea,\u201d said Martin S. Indyk, a former peace negotiator and American ambassador to Israel. \u201cThe Israeli right will use it as a pretext for Israel\u2019s annexation of the West Bank. It is a truly gratuitous move by Trump.\u201d\nDennis B. Ross, another former Middle East negotiator, said the move would make it more difficult for Arab leaders to support the plan being drafted by Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner. The White House is expected to table the plan sometime after the Israeli election.\n\u201cIf it looks like they\u2019re acquiescing to the giving up of Arab land, that makes it harder for them to support a plan that will require other compromises,\u201d Mr. Ross said. \u201cIf what you wanted to do was to present a plan that is likely to succeed, this is not a step you would take.\u201d\nWhen he is in Washington, Mr. Netanyahu is expected to speak at the annual conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel lobbying group that has wide support among American politicians.\nMr. Trump is playing host to Mr. Netanyahu at both an Oval Office meeting and dinner. The president is weighing other gestures to the Israeli leader, people familiar with the deliberations said, including allowing Jonathan J. Pollard, an American intelligence analyst and convicted spy, to travel to Israel.\nMr. Pollard, who was convicted of spying for Israel, was paroled in 2015 but his travel has been restricted. He remains a heroic figure in Israel, and Mr. Netanyahu lobbied for his release from prison.\nThere had been signs that the administration was moving in the direction of recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. A recent State Department report on human rights issues used the phrase \u201cIsraeli-controlled\u201d instead of \u201cIsraeli-occupied\u201d to describe the territories of the Golan Heights, the West Bank and Gaza.\nAnd late last year, the United States voted against a symbolic United Nations resolution that annually condemns Israel\u2019s presence in the Golan Heights, the first time the United States had done so.\nAs they did after the embassy announcement, Trump administration officials said the Golan Heights decision merely recognized reality \u2014 something that is necessary for the Israelis and Palestinians to achieve peace.\n\u201cUnder any conceivable circumstance, Israel could not give up the Golan,\u201d said Jason D. Greenblatt, Mr. Trump\u2019s envoy for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. \u201cTo do so would endanger Israel\u2019s very existence. What President Trump did today was to recognize this.\u201d\n\u201cNo one who understands the region would think that Israel would allow the Golan to be controlled by the failed-state of Syria or by rogue actors operating in the area, including Iran,\u201d he added. \u201cPostponing that realization does nothing to advance the cause of peace or regional stability.\u201d\nThe Arab League condemned the decision, describing it as \u201ccompletely beyond international law.\u201d\n\u201cThe Arab League stands fully behind the Syrian right to its occupied land,\u201d the secretary general of the league, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, said in a statement carried by Egypt\u2019s state news agency MENA.\nBefore Mr. Trump\u2019s statement, Syria\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, Hussam el-Din Ala, warned against Israel\u2019s \u201cmalicious attempts to exploit the situation and the latest developments in Syria and the region to consolidate the occupation\u201d of the Golan Heights.\nCritics of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria have noted that for as much as he and his government have talked about \u201cliberating\u201d the Golan Heights, they have taken little action to do so in decades.\nDuring the early years of the Obama administration, American diplomats tried to broker a peace deal between Israel and Syria. It called for Israel to agree to return the Golan Heights if Syria pledged to stop funneling rockets to Hamas and Hezbollah.\nThe talks broke down after Mr. Assad\u2019s government cracked down on antigovernment protesters.\nFred Hof, a former State Department official who led those talks, said Thursday\u2019s announcement would \u201cbe welcomed by Israel\u2019s bitterest enemies \u2014 Iran and Hezbollah \u2014 who would see annexation as additional justification for terror operations.\u201d He also said it would allow Mr. Assad to change the subject from his war crimes to Israel\u2019s unlawful occupation.\nSome analysts pointed out that Mr. Trump\u2019s gesture amounted to a form of compensation to Israel, since he has ordered American troops to withdraw from Syria \u2014 leaving Israel more vulnerable to attacks.\nFor Mr. Pompeo, the timing of Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet was awkward. He was in Jerusalem as part of a Middle East tour that will take him next to Lebanon, where he said he would talk to officials in Beirut about the threat posed by Hezbollah, a military group that is a major political player in the government.\nLebanon also claims a small sliver of territory that Israel occupies and administers as part of the Golan Heights.\nIn Washington, however, Mr. Trump\u2019s move found support among Republican supporters of Israel, several of whom had pushed legislation that recognized Israel\u2019s sovereignty.\nSenator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, applauded Mr. Trump\u2019s decision, calling it \u201cstrategically wise and overall awesome.\u201d\nBut Hussein Ibish, a scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington, described the move as \u201cblatant electioneering.\u201d\n\u201cIt is the deployment of U.S. foreign policy \u2014 and an extremely radical move at that \u2014 to aid a specific foreign politician who is close to Trump and his family personally and politically,\u201d he said.\nIn Israel, the popularity of the move was evident in expressions of support from Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s main rivals.\nYair Lapid, the leader of the Blue and White coalition, called Mr. Trump\u2019s move a \u201cdream come true.\u201d In a statement, Mr. Lapid said, \u201cthe Golan is an inseparable part of Israel, and we call on the rest of the world to follow President Trump and recognize our sovereignty over the Golan Heights.\u201d", "date": "March 21, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/us/politics/golan-heights-trump.html", "tags": "heights roiling risks middle united israel trump \u201d netanyahu bolsters golan said east"}
