{"title": "The Mueller Report Has Been Released", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2015 Special counsel\u00a0Robert Mueller\u2019s report did not exonerate President Donald Trump of obstruction of justice for Trump\u2019s reactions to Mueller\u2019s probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election.\nA redacted version of the report, which Attorney General William Barr\u00a0made public Thursday, describes 10 instances in which Trump may have obstructed justice by using his authority to interfere with the special counsel investigation. Mueller declined to make a determination about whether the president obstructed justice.\nRead the full report below.\nMueller also found extensive ties between members of the Trump campaign and Russian officials \u2014 but he ultimately did not find that any Trump affiliate illegally participated in Moscow\u2019s efforts to influence the outcome of the 2016 election.\n\u201cBecause we determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment, we did not draw ultimate conclusions about the President\u2019s conduct,\u201d the report states. \u201cThe evidence we obtained about the President\u2019s actions and intent presents difficult issues that would need to be resolved if we were making a traditional prosecutorial judgement.\u201d\n\u201cAt the same time, if we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state. Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, we are unable to reach that judgment. Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him,\u201d it says.\nMost of the initial focus was on the report\u2019s troubling revelations of additional instances of Trump\u2019s potential interference in the investigation. But Mueller also laid out extensive evidence of Russian election interference efforts.\n\u201cThe Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in a sweeping and systematic fashion,\u201d the report states.\nAhead of the report\u2019s release, Barr went to bat for Trump during a press conference at the Justice Department, where he discussed executive privilege, the DOJ\u2019s interactions with the White House in the past few weeks, and the process for redacting the special counsel\u2019s nearly 400-page report.\u00a0Barr held the press conference before reporters, Congress or the public could read the report.\nThe disclosure of the\u00a0nearly 400-page report\u00a0brings an end to Mueller\u2019s special counsel probe, which began in May 2017 after Trump fired former FBI Director James Comey.\u00a0\nThe redacted version of Mueller\u2019s report leaves out grand jury material; intelligence information that might reveal sources and methods; information that may affect ongoing investigations; and information that would \u201cinfringe on the personal privacy and reputational interests of peripheral third parties.\u201d\nBarr previously released a four-page letter that summarized the \u201cprincipal conclusions\u201d of Mueller\u2019s investigation. Mueller\u2019s report, Barr wrote, \u201cdid not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia in its efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\u201d\u00a0\nMueller\u2019s investigation found two main Russian efforts to boost Trump\u2019s candidacy: a social media operation that disparaged Hillary Clinton and boosted Trump, and a hacking campaign to obtain emails from the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party. In his letter, Barr said Mueller uncovered \u201cmultiple offers from Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign,\u201d but did not find any conspiracy or coordination.\nIn his letter, Barr also said that he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein \u2015 the Trump appointee who became a target of Trump\u2019s ire because he authorized Mueller\u2019s special counsel probe \u2015 concluded that \u201cthe evidence developed during the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction of justice offense.\u201d\nBefore he became attorney general, Barr\u00a0wrote an unsolicited memo\u00a0that all but ruled out an obstruction of justice charge against Trump.\u00a0\nThe attorney general previously told Congress that he had \u201cno plans\u201d to submit the Mueller report to the White House for review before releasing it to Congress and the public.\nHouse Democrats\u00a0demanded to see a full, unredacted copy of the Mueller report, setting up a court battle over the document.\u00a0Barr previously said he would testify about the report before the House and Senate Judiciary Committees in early May.\nRedacted Mueller Report by  on Scribd\nThis is a developing story.
