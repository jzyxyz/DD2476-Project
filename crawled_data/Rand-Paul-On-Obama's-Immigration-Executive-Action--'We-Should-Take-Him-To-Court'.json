{"title": "Rand Paul On Obama's Immigration Executive Action- 'We Should Take Him To Court'", "content": "WASHINGTON -- Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said Wednesday that Congress should take legal action against President Barack Obama in response to his planned executive action on immigration.\n\u201cWe should take him to court,\u201d Paul told reporters on Capitol Hill. \u201cTruman was taken to court in Youngstown Steel, and I think we should take him to court.\u201d\n\u201cOur founders were very clear ... [in] the Constitution that the Congress writes the law,\u201d Paul added. \u201cThe president himself has admitted as many as 15 times, saying he\u2019s not a king, he\u2019s not an emperor and he can\u2019t write the law. So really, the media needs to be asking him why he\u2019s changed his mind now.\u201d\nPaul appeared to rule out the threat of a government shutdown when asked if Republicans should use funding for the government to stymie Obama\u2019s action.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have much power right now ... in January we will,\u201d he said.\nPaul also argued in favor of a lawsuit during an appearance on Fox News\u2019 \u201cHannity\u201d on Tuesday.\n\u201cI think with regard to immigration reform, he\u2019s doing something that Congress has not instructed him to do, and in fact has instructed him otherwise,\u201d Paul said. \u201cSo I think the Supreme Court would strike it down ... that takes a while, but that may be the only recourse short of a new president.\u201d\nWhile Republican leaders in Congress have yet to publicly discuss a potential lawsuit, Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) said Wednesday that Obama\u2019s planned executive action is \u201cillegal\u201d and will face legal challenge.\n\u201cI think there'll be lawsuits filed, I believe so,\u201d Portman said on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\"\nHouse Republicans are already suing Obama for delaying the implementation of the employer mandate under the Affordable Care Act. A House GOP leadership aide would not say if House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) is weighing a challenge to Obama over immigration, but acknowledged that several members have suggested a lawsuit.\nSen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), one of the four Republicans who co-authorized a bipartisan immigration reform bill last year, told reporters Wednesday that he would support the idea, but doesn\u2019t believe Congress would have legal standing to sue.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have standing,\u201d McCain said. \u201cWe have to find somebody with standing to claim suit. But yeah, I\u2019d love to challenge it in the court.\u201d\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who also worked on the 2013 immigration bill, told reporters that standing \"would be a hurdle,\" but Congress could try to find a way. He said he opposes shutting down the government and impeachment, but Congress must do something.  \n\"To ask us to do nothing is unfair and unreasonable, to expect us to be mature is reasonable,\" Graham said. \"A lawsuit is part of it, but we do have the power of the purse. I don't mind targeted approaches to defund the executive order. I don't want to impeach the guy and I don't want to shut down the government.\" \nSen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), another co-author of the bipartisan immigration bill, offered another idea: Pass immigration reform. \n\"I hope we respond with legislation,\" Flake told reporters. \"I hope we pass legislation.\"\nObama was set to announce his executive action on Thursday. According to reports, the action will provide relief and work authorization to undocumented parents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent resident children. It also is reported to include changes to high-skilled worker visas and immigration enforcement programs, as well a border security component. To argue that Obama\u2019s action is within the law, the White House has cited prosecutorial discretion, which allows law enforcement to prosecute some and not others due to insufficient resources. \nElise Foley contributed reporting.", "date": "\n11/19/2014", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/rand-paul-immigration-executive-action_n_6188458", "tags": "action- immigration take rand court paul \u201d obama executive action congress sen."}
