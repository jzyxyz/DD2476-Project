{"title": "Kim Jong-un Arrives in Russia for Meeting With Putin", "content": "SEOUL \u2014 Wearing a black fedora and black overcoat, a smiling Kim Jong-un, North Korea\u2019s leader, stepped off an armored train that had taken him on a daylong journey from Pyongyang to the Russian port city of Vladivostok on Wednesday.\nMr. Kim\u2019s arrival came a day before he is scheduled to meet with President Vladimir V. Putin as part of the North Korean leader\u2019s efforts to fend off American pressure to give up his nuclear weapons arsenal.\nAccompanied by senior Russian officials, Mr. Kim listened to a military band before stopping for a rare, short interview with the Russian television network Rossiya 1.\n\u201cI hope this visit will be successful and fruitful,\u201d Mr. Kim said. \u201cI hope that during talks with esteemed President Putin I will have a detailed discussion of the settlement process on the Korean Peninsula and the development of our relations.\u201d\nMr. Kim is the first North Korean leader to travel to Russia since his  father, Kim Jong-il, visited there in 2011, signaling that Mr. Kim is trying to foster ties with his country\u2019s old Soviet allies while his diplomacy with President Trump remains deadlocked.\n[Read about the meeting between Mr. Kim and Mr. Putin the following day.]\nMr. Kim\u2019s  meeting with Mr. Trump in Hanoi, Vietnam, in late February ended abruptly when the North Korean leader rejected Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal for a \u201cbig deal\u201d in which the United States would lift sanctions in return for a quick dismantlement of the North\u2019s entire nuclear weapons program. Mr. Kim offered only a partial dismantlement in exchange for lifting the most harmful economic sanctions.\nNorth Korea has since grown increasingly frustrated with Washington, conducting a weapons test and accusing Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, John R. Bolton, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo of sabotaging the negotiations. Mr. Kim said he was willing to meet Mr. Trump again, but only if the United States made a new proposal that the North could accept by the end of the year.\nA recent report by the United Nations sanctions committee has accused Russia of helping North Korea circumvent international sanctions through illegal ship-to-ship transfers of oil and coal. But there is doubt over Russia\u2019s ability to ease the pain of sanctions for North Korea.\nMoscow is obligated to honor the United Nations sanctions it has voted for. And North Korea and Russia share a short border, precluding the kind of widespread smuggling believed to be taking place between the North and China. Mr. Kim has met China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, four times as he sought help from China, which accounts for more than 93 percent of the North\u2019s external trade.\nBy securing a meeting with Mr. Putin this week, Mr. Kim sought to reaffirm his image as a global player despite the failure to reach an agreement with Mr. Trump in Hanoi. His meeting with Mr. Putin also sent a signal to Washington that Mr. Kim was expanding his diplomatic chess game.\n\u201cIf perception is indeed reality, North Korea has come to be perceived as now a player in Northeast Asia, meaning Kim\u2019s carefully calibrated P.R. offensive is working \u2014 much to Washington\u2019s dismay,\u201d said Harry J. Kazianis, the director of Korean studies at the Center for the National Interest, a research institute in Washington.\n\u201cAnd in the long run,\u201d Mr. Kazianis said, \u201csuch a strategy could very well pay off, if Kim is no longer perceived as a threat, leading eventually to a weakened sanctions regime.\u201d\nRussia and China have supported American-led sanctions against the North at the United Nations Security Council, but at the same time have provided the North with a buffer against American pressure. They support the North\u2019s argument that the United States and North Korea should resolve their differences in \u201ca step-by-step approach\u201d by trading security guarantees for North Korean actions toward complete denuclearization.\nWith talks with Washington stalled, Mr. Kim may align more closely with Beijing, Moscow or both, in much the same way as the United States tried to bring Seoul and Tokyo together to deter China\u2019s ascendancy and combat a nuclear North Korea.\nIf Mr. Kim concludes that his two-way diplomacy with Mr. Trump is in vain, he may play off Mr. Putin\u2019s desire to increase his own influence in Asia. Japanese news outlets reported this week that during his meeting with Mr. Kim, Mr. Putin could call for the reopening of so-called six-party talks on the North\u2019s nuclear disarmament.\nBefore the 2009 collapse of the talks \u2014 which included China, Russia and Japan as well as the United States and North and South Korea \u2014 they had produced denuclearization deals, but they were later abrogated.\nMr. Trump has repeatedly cited the talks as a prime example of how past administrations\u2019 dealings with North Korea failed and how his own leader-to-leader diplomacy with Mr. Kim stood a far better chance of bringing about Pyongyang\u2019s denuclearization.", "date": "April 24, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/24/world/asia/kim-jong-un-vladimir-putin.html", "tags": "sanctions arrives united meeting \u201d russia jong-un kim north korea putin"}
