If violated, you can be deported from the country.\" \nBoth universities said the material was fabricated and unacceptable. The flyers have been reported to police.\nStudent Lisa Lu said on Twitter: \"I don't know who would do this on the very first day of the new semester. Even [if] it's a joke IT IS NOT FUNNY AT ALL!\"\nUniversity of Melbourne Union president Yan Zhuang said she \"vehemently\" opposed the material.\n\"The posters have been attributed to a white supremacist, neo-Nazi group which has previously targeted the University of Melbourne,\" she said.\nMore than a quarter of international students in Australia come from China.
