{"title": "TikTok, a Chinese Video App, Brings Fun Back to Social Media", "content": "About an hour after downloading TikTok, the popular video-sharing app, I experienced a bizarre sensation, one I haven\u2019t felt in a long time while on the internet. The knot in my chest loosened, my head felt injected with helium, and the corners of my mouth crept upward into a smile.\nWas this \u2026 happiness?\nTikTok \u2014 a quirky hybrid of Snapchat, the defunct video app Vine and the TV segment \u201cCarpool Karaoke\u201d \u2014 is a refreshing outlier in the social media universe. \nThere are no ads. There\u2019s no news, unless you count learning about viral dance crazes. There are few preening Instagram models hawking weight-loss tea, and a distinct lack of crazy uncles posting Infowars clips.\nInstead, TikTok \u2014 a Chinese-made app that was known as Musical.ly until ByteDance, the Chinese internet conglomerate, acquired the company in 2017 and merged it with a video app it owned \u2014 has a simple premise. Users create short videos set to music, often lip-syncing along, dancing or acting out short skits. The app contains templates and visual effects to spice up the videos. There is also a live-streaming feature that allows users to send virtual \u201cgifts\u201d to their favorite creators, which can be bought with real money. The rest works like any other social app \u2014 followers, hashtags, likes and comments.\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like much. But, somehow, it adds up to what might well be the only truly pleasant social network in existence.\nI feel comfortable making that call because I go on social networks for a living, and I have spent thousands of hours wading through an unholy slurry of Twitter spammers, Instagram scammers, teenage YouTube fascists and baby boomers whose brains have been turned to pudding by too many Facebook memes.\nTikTok has none of that. Instead, it\u2019s that rarest of internet creatures: a place where people can let down their guards, act silly with their friends and sample the fruits of human creativity without being barraged by abusive trolls or algorithmically amplified misinformation. It\u2019s a throwback to a time before the commercialization of internet influence, when web culture consisted mainly of harmless weirdos trying to make each other laugh.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of an escape,\u201d said Billy Mann, a TikTok creator who uses the platform to make comedy videos for his more than 650,000 followers. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a safe haven for people that are seeing the world on fire and being like, \u2018I need silliness,\u2019\u201d he said.\nTikTok\u2019s earnest goofiness has turned off some skeptics. But it\u2019s hard to argue with the numbers. The app recently passed six million users in the United States, according to a report from the market research firm Sensor Tower. As of Friday, it ranked No. 4 among free apps in Apple\u2019s app store, ahead of Snapchat, Netflix and Facebook Messenger. Globally, the app, whose Chinese version is called Douyin, had 500 million monthly active users as of July, making it bigger than Twitter and about half the size of Instagram.\nCurrently, TikTok makes money through virtual gift sales and brand collaborations, such as a Guess-sponsored \u201cfashion takeover.\u201d There are no ads inside the app, although the company's privacy policy leaves room for them in the future. TikTok, which is privately held, does not disclose financial information, but Sensor Tower estimates that it took in roughly $3.5 million in October.\nTikTok\u2019s success has spawned legions of influencers, users with millions of followers and household-name status among teenagers. And it has propelled ByteDance, which also owns a suite of other social media and news apps, to a reported valuation of $75 billion, making it one of the most valuable start-ups in the world.\nTikTok\u2019s global head of marketing, Stefan Heinrich, said in a statement that the company\u2019s mission was to \u201ccapture and present the world\u2019s creativity, knowledge and moments that matter, directly from the mobile phone.\u201d\nIn perhaps the clearest sign that TikTok is on to something, Facebook is trying to kill it. Last month, the company quietly released Lasso, a clunky clone that borrowed many of TikTok\u2019s core features and even tried to siphon off some of its power users. Lasso got off to a slow start, and is now the 687th most downloaded photo and video app in the United States, according to the mobile data company AppAnnie. The executive leading the Lasso team, Brady Voss, left the company shortly after the app was released. (Facebook declined to comment, and Mr. Voss did not respond to a request for comment.)\nBefore I go any further, let\u2019s get one thing out of the way: If you\u2019re reading this, you are almost certainly too old to feel at home on TikTok. The company declined to provide information about its users, but judging from what\u2019s on the platform, the median TikTok user seems to hover in the midteens. TikTok is full of acne-studded faces, barely concealed tween angst and impenetrable youth-culture references. As far as I can tell, there is no way for adults to use it without feeling as if they are chaperoning a high school dance.\nOfficially, TikTok users must be 13 or older to join. But the age-verification process is easy to circumvent, and while browsing the platform, I stumbled upon several videos starring people who appeared to be much younger. In its previous incarnation as Musical.ly, TikTok drew fire from some privacy advocates, who accused it of pushing the limits of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act, a law that prohibits the collection of certain types of information from users younger than 13.\n\u201cIt\u2019s clearly a really popular, cool site, but you also have the issue of kids being significantly too young for it,\u201d said James P. Steyer, the chief executive of Common Sense Media, a nonprofit that reviews tech products for families. \u201cIt\u2019s not that the content on TikTok isn\u2019t O.K. for your 15-year-old. It\u2019s what happens to your 6- or 7-year-old.\u201d\nWhile using TikTok, I never saw examples of bullying or harassment. (Both of which are prohibited by TikTok\u2019s community guidelines, as is sexually explicit content.) There are, however, a decent number of videos featuring teenage girls dancing suggestively \u2014 which, if you are a 31-year-old newspaper columnist and not a 16-year-old boy, is fairly unsettling.\nA TikTok spokeswoman said in a statement that promoting safety and positivity on the platform is \u201cour top priority.\u201d She added, \u201cwe periodically add to and adjust our protective measures, policies and moderation efforts to support the well-being of our users.\u201d\nLast year, after two other apps owned by ByteDance were criticized by Chinese officials for promoting objectionable content, the company\u2019s chief executive, Zhang Yiming, said that it would increase the ranks of its content moderation team to 10,000 moderators, from 6,000. The TikTok spokeswoman declined to say how many of those moderators work for TikTok, or whether content standards for American users differ from those for users in China, where famously strict censorship laws apply.\nFree-speech advocates might bristle at TikTok\u2019s Chinese ownership, and privacy hawks have raised questions about how the company handles users\u2019 personal data. But perhaps because it is more heavily moderated than other networks, TikTok mostly feels safe and wholesome. Julia Alexander, a fellow TikTok convert at The Verge, called it \u201ca rare social app that isn\u2019t infested with hateful rhetoric.\u201d\nOne popular genre of TikTok video is the \u201cchallenge,\u201d a kind of video skit that is acted out en masse. One challenge, #eatonthebeat, encouraged users to make videos of themselves chomping down on food to the beat of a song.\nAnother challenge, #chooseyourcharacter, encouraged users to mimic a video game\u2019s character selection screen.\nThen there are the running jokes attached to specific songs \u2014 like \u201cGood Girls Bad Guys,\u201d a song by the band Falling in Reverse, which is used for a genre of video in which a user appears first in nerdy, unattractive clothes, and then cuts abruptly to a made-over version of himself in sunglasses, leather jackets or other bad-boy attire.\nDespite TikTok\u2019s teens-only vibe, some adults have started to trickle on. Jimmy Fallon, the late-night TV host, recently joined the site and started posting his own challenges. The comedian Amy Schumer recently made a TikTok video, and prominent YouTubers like Jake Paul have tested the waters.\nIs TikTok a Facebook killer? No, probably not. For all the variety in its videos, it is still a fairly limited app, with a more narrow appeal than more populist social platforms.\nBut by purposely limiting its features, by resisting the temptation to monetize its users aggressively and by keeping trolls and bullies off its platform, TikTok has done something truly impressive \u2014 it has built a social network that is genuinely fun to use.\nThere might be a lesson there.", "date": "Dec. 3, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/03/technology/tiktok-a-chinese-video-app-brings-fun-back-to-social-media.html", "tags": "brings fun users company tiktok videos media back social app \u201d chinese video \u2014"}
