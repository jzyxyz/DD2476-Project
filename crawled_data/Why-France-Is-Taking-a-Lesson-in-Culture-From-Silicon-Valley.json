{"title": "Why France Is Taking a Lesson in Culture From Silicon Valley", "content": "PARIS \u2014 One thousand start-ups in a refurbished train depot as long as the Eiffel Tower lying down. Rooms scattered with Legos and beanbag chairs. Elevated walkways bridging cargo-container offices and open-air desks. Graffitied railway cars transformed into cafes. \nThe vast project in the heart of Paris, Station F, is a symbol of France\u2019s ambitions to be the start-up capital of Europe. Under an arc of glass and curved concrete, it aims to amass the largest group of entrepreneurs, venture capital firms, incubators and accelerators anywhere in the world.\nThe ambitious effort would seem an expensive, even quixotic undertaking for France, a country better known for a 35-hour workweek and rigid labor laws. And plenty of countries are trying to emulate Silicon Valley\u2019s start-up ecosystem, with varying degrees of success. \nWhile France needs to lure more international investors and further ease rules for entrepreneurs, the country, backed by government officials and tech leaders, has started to inject new energy into the start-up scene. France has already become one of Europe\u2019s top destinations for start-up investment; venture capital and funding deals last year surpassed that activity in  Germany, making it second only to Britain in Europe.\nSilicon Valley has taken notice. Facebook and Amazon are backing Station F. Microsoft is basing its newest artificial intelligence start-up program there, and will be joined by French giants like the video game publisher Ubisoft and overseas players like Line, the Japanese messaging app. President Emmanuel Macron inaugurated the site on Thursday as part of a push to make France \u201cthe leading country for hyper-innovation,\" urging an enthusiastic crowd of entrepreneurs to \"transform\" and \"shake up\" the nation.\u00a0\nStation F is the brainchild of Xavier Niel, a technology billionaire bent on transforming the French start-up scene. He\u2019s invested 250 million euros (about $280 million) of his own money and brought in a Silicon Valley up-and-comer, Roxanne Varza, to lead the effort. \nOften referred to as the Richard Branson of France, Mr. Niel, 49, is one if the country\u2019s most successful tech entrepreneurs, worth around $8.1 billion. He shook up French telecoms by starting an ultra low-cost internet service and mobile operator, Free, which forced industry stalwarts to follow. An aggressive investor, he co-founded Kima Ventures, which focuses on early stage start-ups, and a coding school called 42, with no tuition, teachers or textbooks. \nMr. Niel sees Station F as a way to help France steal Britain\u2019s crown as Europe\u2019s premier start-up hub. Raised in a gritty suburb of Paris, he is also trying to empower would-be entrepreneurs, especially marginalized youths. And he wants to capitalize on France\u2019s strength as a producer of math and engineering whizzes. \nBorn in Silicon Valley to Iranian parents, Ms. Varza, 32, is the former managing director of Girls in Tech Paris, a chapter of the nonprofit Girls in Tech, which is focused on improving gender equality in a male-dominated industry, and FailCon, a conference for start-up founders to learn from failure. After working at several young ventures, Ms. Varza, an avowed Francophile, moved to Paris in 2012 to oversee Microsoft\u2019s  start-up operations in France. Mr. Niel recruited her after seeing articles she had written critiquing the French tech scene. \nMs. Varza has been trying to lure to Station F the early-stage start-ups that have the potential to be the next disrupters in health, finance, education and even fashion. Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union, she says, has been an opportunity to snap up talent.\u00a0\nTo get into Station F, start-ups had to have a business prototype and a path to growth. A group of 1,000 companies are expected to move into the space by early July. Here are three of them.\nArtificial intelligence\nShankar Arul co-founded this French-Indian start-up, which  allows users to convert large amounts of data into graphics and offers data analysis online. \u00a0With three employees and offices in Chennai and London, he counts Groupon among his clients. \nFood tech\nThis Paris-based online delicatessen, with 25 employees, delivers homemade dishes and produce to hundreds of clients. Its founders, Paul L\u00ea and Alban Wienkoop, are betting on Station F as a platform to expand internationally. They plan to tap ShakeUpFactory, an accelerator that specializes in helping food start-ups, for contacts and funding. \nHigh-tech fabrics\nR\u00e9v\u00e8le develops high-tech shock-absorbing fabrics  to protect women in heavy contact sports like rugby and boxing. The company, founded last year in Paris by Cl\u00e9mence Fabre and Laetitia Pingel, quickly expanded internationally, with half of its sales now coming from the United States and Britain. \nTech leaders say France has significant potential. In 2016, French start-ups attracted record levels of investment from business angels, venture capital, growth equity funds and corporate investors \u2014 on par with Israel and in reach of Britain. \nAs the French start-up scene takes off, BlaBlaCar, a low-cost ride sharing service, is one of the early winners. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mazzella got the idea after he couldn\u2019t get to his family\u2019s home in southern France for Christmas in 2003. \nBack then, the French start-up culture was virtually nonexistent. There was no ecosystem of incubators and funding. He and his co-founders relied on money from family and friends for six years before venture capital funds stepped in.\nToday, BlaBlaCar is one of four French \u201cunicorns\u201d (start-ups valued over $1 billion), with 45 million users in 22 countries and a global staff of 500. \nIn France, \u201centrepreneurs used to be seen as people with nothing left to lose,\u201d said Mr. Mazzella, sitting in his company\u2019s sleek new headquarters near the Paris Bourse, a couple of floors down from Facebook\u2019s France operations. \u201cNow it\u2019s become acceptable, even desirable, to be a start-up.\u201d \nFailure is often stigmatized in French society \u2014 so much that the government started a campaign to persuade people that it\u2019s O.K. to take risks. More than three quarters of workers hold so-called jobs for life, and unions protest when businesses demand workplace flexibility. Taxes are high to fund France\u2019s social welfare system, and the 3,400-page labor code introduces new regulatory requirements on companies as they get larger.\nIt is a culture sometimes at odds with entrepreneurial drive. \nKarim Oumnia, 49, the founder of Digitsole, which makes a temperature-controlled \u201csmart shoe\u201d that monitors health and automatically wraps around the wearer\u2019s foot, is considering leaving France to propel his business. \nFounded in 2014, Digitsole employs 20 people in the town of Nancy and has won numerous orders from European sports teams. Former President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande cited Mr. Oumnia as an emblem of French entrepreneurship. \u00a0\nBut Mr. Oumnia has struggled to scale up. When he wanted to offer stock options to lure and retain engineers and designers, the French rules were so complex that he dropped the plan. Social\u00a0taxes pushed his employee costs to nearly twice what they would be in the United States.\u00a0\nThe financial infrastructure isn\u2019t fully developed, either. France has around 4,500 angels, investors who take risks on first-stage start-ups, compared with 18,000 in Britain. While more venture capital is flowing into France, the levels still lag Britain, Germany and Israel.\n\u201cFrance has plenty of talent to create start-ups,\u201d Mr. Oumnia said. \u201cThe problem is to grow them to midsize companies that create jobs in a country where unemployment is high.\u201d \n\u201cRegulations and taxes have still not evolved enough to allow start-ups to flourish once they get off the ground,\u201d he said, adding that he hoped President Macron would change things. \u201cSo it\u2019s fine to say, let\u2019s create a thousand start-ups. The question is, \u2018Are you creating the environment for them to become champions after?\u2019\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cThe answer is, \u2018Not yet.\u2019\u201d \nMr. Macron has pledged to make the country more business friendly, with the government paying particular attention to entrepreneurs. Here is a look at France\u2019s tech agenda.\nINVESTING BILLIONS The government has created numerous state investment vehicles like the  French Tech Acceleration Fund and the Large Venture Fund. Led by the French public investment bank, Bpifrance, with \u20ac42 billion  under management, the state makes billions in loans and grants available to fund start-ups and accelerators at easy terms. Mr.  Macron recently announced another \u20ac10 billion euro public fund to invest in start-ups. Such backing, critics say, can make it hard to discern whether French start-ups are competitive. \nPROMOTING TECH In 2014, the government started French Tech, a sprawling program to burnish the country\u2019s tech credentials. Thirteen French cities were designated high-tech hubs, including Bordeaux, better known for wine. The government also supports the growth of French start-ups in dozens of foreign cities, including New York and Shanghai, and promotes French entrepreneurs at big industry events like the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.\nOFFERING INCENTIVES The government is trying to lure international tech talent to France by providing a fast-track work visa for entrepreneurs and their families, relocation grants and free office space. \u00a0\nEASING TAX LAWS France created a special tax status for \u201cinnovative new companies\u201d and has granted over \u20ac1.17 billion in tax exemptions for 6,600 start-ups since 2004. Still, entrepreneurs say more needs to be done. In a bid to stoke more start-up investment, Mr. Macron has pledged to exempt ownership of company stakes from France\u2019s wealth tax and introduce a flat capital-gains tax of 30 percent, down from as high as 50 percent now. \nThe biggest vote of confidence in Station F is from Facebook. \nA few years ago, the social media giant set up an artificial intelligence hub in Paris \u2014 its third after Silicon Valley and New York \u2014 to recruit from what it saw as a source of talented engineers at France\u2019s elite universities, and from around Europe. The unit researches improvements to image and speech recognition, and other artificial intelligence applications. \nThe company is now anchoring an incubator program at Station F called Startup Garage, which will mentor 12 budding tech entrepreneurs every six months in health, education and other fields, and capitalize on their creative ideas. In exchange for coaching, Facebook will observe how the start-ups approach issues like privacy, and identify cutting-edge tech trends, said Caroline Matte, 26, Facebook\u2019s French start-up program manager.\n\u201cFrance can definitely become a start-up nation,\u201d said Ms. Matte, a French national. \u201cThe potential is there.\u201d   ", "date": "June 29, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/29/business/station-f-tech-incubator-france.html", "tags": "taking french silicon tech lesson \u201d start-ups start-up culture entrepreneurs station valley france"}
