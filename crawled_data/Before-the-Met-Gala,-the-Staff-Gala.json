{"title": "Before the Met Gala, the Staff Gala", "content": "If the fashion world waits with bated breath for the First Monday in May \u2014 the immovable date of the annual Met Gala, the so-called \u201cOscars of the fashion world\u201d \u2014 a little preview arrives the Saturday just before.\nThat is when Sally Singer, the creative director of Vogue, hosts a party of her own, on the same theme as the Met Gala, for the Vogue staff who will work the event. (Many are pressed into service as, essentially, exquisitely dressed human statuary, lining the entrance hall of the Met.) Before service, then, a staff meal of sorts: dinner, dancing and dressing up, with a few well-placed celebrity friends for spice, the kind who might go to the Met but maintain an aspirational level of cool nonetheless.\n\u201cThis is the first year that Chlo\u00eb Sevigny and Alexa Chung can\u2019t come,\u201d Ms. Singer said. \u201cThey\u2019re two of my favorite guests.\u201d\nThe theme this year being \u201ccamp,\u201d the Stonewall Inn was selected as the space, and as the sun began to set on the West Village, Lyft after Lyft (a sponsor) arrived to deposit models and staffers in improbably poufy gowns at its historic door. The 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots, generally considered the opening salvo of the L.G.B.T. rights movement, is in June, and just inside the entryway hangs a marker: \u201cThis is a Raided Premises. Police Dept.\u201d If this \u2019wall could talk, camp would surely be in its vocabulary.\nAs worn by Vogue\u2019s party guests, camp tended to express itself as a willingness to expand to greater circumferences than usual, and the space was soon crowded with radiating layers of tulle. \nNot everyone got into the theme \u2014 Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez, the designers of Proenza Schouler, did not wear the bunny ears their friend Sara Moonves (of W magazine) had brought for them. Ms. Moonves was lop-eared in a pair of her own \u2014\u00a0but many did their best interpretations. The designer Batsheva Hay came with a Zabar\u2019s bag; the Paper magazine editor Mickey Boardman in a sequined Celine Dion top from the Caesars Palace gift shop. Dara Allen, a young model recently anointed by Vogue, wore a pixieish pageboy wig, rhinestoned eyebrows and white baby-doll dress by Vera Wang. \n[Related: Lady Gaga\u2019s Many Met Gala Dresses on the 2019 red carpet.]\n\u201cI feel like a baby, an alien and Liza Minnelli,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s Baby \u2018Cabaret\u2019 in Space.\u201d She paused, having not quite captured the effect, then added, \u201cOn Ice. And the hat is fashionably late.\u201d\nOnce Marc Jacobs, the designer, and Kacey Musgraves, the singer-songwriter, had arrived, the crowd whooshed upstairs, for a dinner of mini-burgers and pigs in blankets catered by the Four Seasons and a performance by Aquaria, a winner of \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race.\u201d \n\u201cDrag queens at the Met? Very cool,\u201d she announced from the stage. \u201cDrag queens at Stonewall before the Met? A little predictable, but still cool.\u201d Then she lip-synced to Eartha Kitt and a standup bit by Bette Midler.\nThen it was back downstairs to dance until (and after) Stonewall opened its doors to the public at 11 p.m. Sometime around then, a weathered West Villager in glitter lipstick stopped to surveil the scene. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she asked, casting a wary eye at Aweng Chuol. The model was leaning against the Stonewall window in a printed gown by Richard Quinn and a wig of Marilyn Monroe peroxide curls. \u201cIt looks like she should be at fashion week at Lincoln Center.\u201d", "date": "May 6, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/06/fashion/met-gala-vogue-staff-dinner.html", "tags": "fashion gala stonewall \u201d vogue theme many \u2014 met staff"}
