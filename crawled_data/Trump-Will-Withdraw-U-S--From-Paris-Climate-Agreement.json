{"title": "Trump Will Withdraw U.S. From Paris Climate Agreement", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump announced on Thursday that the United States would withdraw from the Paris climate accord, weakening efforts to combat global warming and embracing isolationist voices in his White House who argued that the agreement was a pernicious threat to the economy and American sovereignty.\nIn a speech from the Rose Garden, Mr. Trump said the landmark 2015 pact imposed wildly unfair environmental standards on American businesses and workers. He vowed to stand with the people of the United States against what he called a \u201cdraconian\u201d international deal.\n\u201cI was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris,\u201d the president said, drawing support from members of his Republican Party but widespread condemnation from political leaders, business executives and environmentalists around the globe.\nMr. Trump\u2019s decision to abandon the agreement for environmental action signed by 195 nations is a remarkable rebuke to heads of state, climate activists, corporate executives and members of the president\u2019s own staff, who all failed to change his mind with an intense, last-minute lobbying blitz. The Paris agreement was intended to bind the world community into battling rising temperatures in concert, and the departure of the Earth\u2019s second-largest polluter is a major blow.\nMr. Trump said he wanted to negotiate a better deal for the United States, and the administration said he had placed calls to the leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Canada to personally explain his decision. A statement from the White House press secretary said the president \u201creassured the leaders that America remains committed to the trans-Atlantic alliance and to robust efforts to protect the environment.\u201d\nBut within minutes of the president\u2019s remarks, the leaders of France, Germany and Italy issued a joint statement saying that the Paris climate accord was \u201cirreversible\u201d and could not be renegotiated.\nThe decision was a victory for Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist, and Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, who spent months quietly making their case to the president about the dangers of the agreement. Inside the West Wing, the pair overcame intense opposition from other top aides, including Gary D. Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, the president\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump, and his secretary of state, Rex Tillerson.\nMs. Trump, in particular, fought to make sure that her father heard from people supportive of the agreement, setting up calls and meetings with world leaders, corporate executives and others. But by Thursday, aides who pushed to remain part of the agreement were disconsolate, and it was Mr. Pruitt whom the president brought up for victory remarks at the Rose Garden event.\nThe president\u2019s speech was his boldest and most sweeping assertion of an \u201cAmerica first\u201d foreign policy doctrine since he assumed office four months ago. He vowed to turn the country\u2019s empathy inward, rejecting financial assistance for pollution controls in developing nations in favor of providing help to American cities struggling to hire police officers.\n\u201cIt would once have been unthinkable that an international agreement could prevent the United States from conducting its own domestic affairs,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\nIn Mr. Trump\u2019s view, the Paris accord represents an attack on the sovereignty of the United States and a threat to the ability of his administration to reshape the nation\u2019s environmental laws in ways that benefit everyday Americans.\n\u201cAt what point does America get demeaned? At what point do they start laughing at us as a country?\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want other leaders and other countries laughing at us anymore. And they won\u2019t be.\u201d\nBut business leaders like Elon Musk of Tesla, Jeffrey R. Immelt of General Electric and Lloyd C. Blankfein of Goldman Sachs said the decision would ultimately harm the economy by ceding the jobs of the future in clean energy and technology to overseas competitors.\nMr. Musk, who had agreed to be a member of a two business-related councils that Mr. Trump set up this year, wrote on Twitter that he would leave those panels.\n\u201cClimate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,\u201d he said.\nUnder the accord, the United States had pledged to cut its greenhouse gas emissions 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 and commit up to $3 billion in aid for poorer countries by 2020.\nBy stepping away from the Paris agreement, the president made good on a campaign promise to \u201ccancel\u201d an agreement he repeatedly mocked at rallies. As president, he has moved rapidly to reverse Obama-era policies aimed at allowing the United States to meet its pollution-reduction targets as set under the agreement.\n\u201cWe are getting out,\u201d Mr. Trump said Thursday. \u201cBut we will start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that\u2019s fair. And if we can, that\u2019s great.\u201d\nIn his remarks, Mr. Trump listed sectors of the United States economy that would lose revenue and jobs if the country remained part of the accord, citing a study \u2014 vigorously disputed by environmental groups \u2014 asserting that the agreement would cost 2.7 million jobs by 2025.\nBut he will stick to the withdrawal process laid out in the Paris agreement, which President Barack Obama joined and most of the world has already ratified. That could take nearly four years to complete, meaning a final decision would be up to the American voters in the next presidential election.\nRepublican lawmakers hailed Mr. Trump\u2019s decision, calling it a necessary antidote to the overreach of Mr. Obama\u2019s policies aimed at reducing planet-warming carbon emissions.\n\u201cI applaud President Trump and his administration for dealing yet another significant blow to the Obama administration\u2019s assault on domestic energy production and jobs,\u201d said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader.\nBut Mr. Trump\u2019s call for new global negotiations about the planet\u2019s climate drew derision from Democrats in the United States and other heads of state.\nPresident Emmanuel Macron of France and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada each issued rebukes to Mr. Trump. \u201cMake our planet great again,\u201d Mr. Macron said.\nOn Twitter, Miguel Arias Ca\u00f1ete, the European Union\u2019s commissioner for climate, said that \u201ctoday\u2019s announcement has galvanized us rather than weakened us, and this vacuum will be filled by new broad committed leadership.\u201d\nMr. Obama, in a rare assertion of his political views as a former president, said, \u201cThe nations that remain in the Paris agreement will be the nations that reap the benefits in jobs and industries created.\u201d\n\u201cEven in the absence of American leadership; even as this administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future; I\u2019m confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we\u2019ve got,\u201d Mr. Obama said.\nIn recent days, Mr. Trump withstood withering criticism from European counterparts who accused him of shirking America\u2019s role as a global leader and America\u2019s responsibility as history\u2019s largest emitter of planet-warming greenhouse gasses.\nAfter a fierce debate inside the administration, the White House on Thursday took on the trappings of a celebration. The Rose Garden was packed with reporters, activists and members of Mr. Trump\u2019s administration. Scores of staff members lined the sides of the Rose Garden as a military band played soft jazz.\nSupporters of the Paris agreements reacted with pent-up alarm, condemning the administration for shortsightedness about the planet and a reckless willingness to shatter longstanding diplomatic relationships.\n\u201cRemoving the United States from the Paris agreement is a reckless and indefensible action,\u201d said Al Gore, the former vice president who has become an evangelist for fighting climate change. \u201cIt undermines America\u2019s standing in the world and threatens to damage humanity\u2019s ability to solve the climate crisis in time.\u201d\nCorporate leaders also condemned Mr. Trump\u2019s action.\nOn its website, I.B.M. reaffirmed its support for the Paris agreement and took issue with the president\u2019s contention that it was a bad deal for American workers and the American economy.\n\u201cThis agreement requires all participating countries to put forward their best efforts on climate change as determined by each country,\u201d the company said. \u201cI.B.M. believes that it is easier to lead outcomes by being at the table, as a participant in the agreement, rather than from outside it.\u201d\nMr. Immelt, the chairman and chief executive of General Electric, took to Twitter to say he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with the decision. \u201cClimate change is real,\u201d he said. \u201cIndustry must now lead and not depend on government.\u201d\nBut Mr. Trump was resolute.\n\u201cIt is time to put Youngstown, Ohio; Detroit, Mich.; and Pittsburgh, Pa., along with many, many other locations within our great country, before Paris, France,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is time to make America great again.\u201d\nThe mayor of Pittsburgh, Bill Peduto, responded on Twitter, \u201cI can assure you that we will follow the guidelines of the Paris Agreement for our people, our economy & future.\u201d", "date": "June 1, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/01/climate/trump-paris-climate-agreement.html", "tags": "agreement u.s. united states \u201d trump climate withdraw paris"}
