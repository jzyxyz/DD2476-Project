{"title": "Where does Tory-DUP deal leave power-sharing talks?", "content": "Northern Ireland will receive an extra \u00a31bn over the next two years as part of the deal that will see the Democratic Unionist Party's 10 MPs back Theresa May's minority government in Commons votes.\nDUP leader Arlene Foster said the \"wide-ranging\" pact was \"good for Northern Ireland and the UK\" -  but where does it leave talks to restore power-sharing in Belfast?\nArlene Foster made a point of finishing her comments outside Number 10 by announcing she was returning immediately to Stormont to try to re-establish the power sharing executive.\nTheresa May's deputy, Damian Green, also defended the financial largesse as an attempt to help Stormont politicians to overcome their differences.\nAfter her Westminster election success, the DUP leader is going nowhere. \nHer party argues that Sinn F\u00e9in should abandon its red line of refusing to share power with Mrs Foster until an inquiry into the controversial RHI heating scheme is over. \nAccording to this logic, republicans should not look Theresa May's gift horse in the mouth, but concentrate on resuming their ministerial duties and help to hand out the extra cash.\nGerry Adams's initial response treats the DUP-Conservative deal like a \"curate's egg\" - that is \"good in parts\". \nThe Sinn F\u00e9in president acknowledged that the extra cash would \"help to ease the enormous pressure\" on Northern Ireland's public services. \nRead more analysis from BBC News NI Business Editor John Campbell\nBut he added that \"the devil is in the detail\" - and attacked the agreement as providing a \"blank cheque for a Tory Brexit\".\nWith the deadline for the Stormont talks on Thursday, there is not much time for the politicians to ponder their options. \nSinn Fein will want to make more progress on their other objectives, like greater legal recognition for the Irish language. \nIt is uncertain whether republicans will erase their red line, but the DUP-Tory deal has given them something to think about.
