We know how this story ends if we keep with that rhetoric,\" said the Birdman, Babel and Revenant director.\nReferring to climate change he said: \"The world is melting and these guys are basically ruling with rage and anger and lies and they are basically writing fiction and making people believe those are real thing and facts.\"\nThe 55-year-old, who was joined on the jury press conference panel by judges including Babel actor Elle Fanning and Oscar-nominated director Yorgos Lanthimos, added: \"I'm not a politician but as an artist I can express through my job with a heart open what I think and be truthful to what I leave through the work that I did.\"\nA few hours later, the festival's opening film - Jarmusch's dark zombie comedy - provided a slightly more satirical swipe on the leading world authorities, regarding current climate change and immigration policies.\nThe film, starring Bill Murray, Adam Driver and Tilda Swinton, concerns a zombie apocalypse brought about by \"polar fracking\" that sends the Earth off its axis.\n\"Maybe it'll all just go away like a bad dream,\" declares Murray.\n\"I doubt it,\" replies Driver, \"This is all gonna end badly\".\nThe topical movie comes just weeks after the Extinction Rebellion protests brought parts of London to a standstill.\nThe Dead Don't Die, which also features Selena Gomez, Chloe Sevigny and a brilliant cameo by the undead coffee-addicted Iggy Pop, earlier saw Steve Buscemi lampoon US President Donald Trump's signature Make America Great Again cap.\nHis character donned a similar one bearing the slogan Keep America Racist Again.\nThere were fits of laughter across the press screening throughout, though, and none more so than when Murray appeared to briefly nod off during a meandering pre-screening speech by French comedian Edouard Baer.\nThe opening ceremony was simultaneously beamed into 600 cinemas across France.\nStars of The Dead Don't Die headed off into the lively Cannes night, but are set to appear before the press again to answer questions on Wednesday morning.\nThe film festival is expected to get even more political as the week goes on, thanks to new works by socially-conscious Cannes veterans Ken Loach and Terrence Malick, as well as the first ever competition-listed film by a black woman - in the form of Mati Diop's Atlantics.\nI\u00f1\u00e1rritu and the eight-strong panel will watch and then discuss the merits of all 21 films in competition over the next fortnight.\nThe winner will be awarded the esteemed Palme d'Or prize at the festival finale and the boss declared on Tuesday that the panel would make a decision based on \"the art\" and not \"the name or fame\" of each director's offering.", "date": "15 May 2019", "href": "https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-48276693", "tags": "film opening \u2018 world leaders warning cannes festival director fires die ignorant dead press"}
