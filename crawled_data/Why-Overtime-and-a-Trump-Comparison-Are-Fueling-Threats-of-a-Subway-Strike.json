{"title": "Why Overtime and a Trump Comparison Are Fueling Threats of a Subway Strike", "content": "[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]\nThe claim was stunning: A single worker on the Long Island Rail Road earned $344,000 in overtime last year. \nYes, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority confirmed, the worker managed to log 3,864 hours of overtime, part of a trend in which dozens of transit workers received millions of dollars for working extra hours. \nHigh overtime costs have been a longstanding problem at the authority, but the latest figures have sparked an angry standoff between Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and the transit workers union. \nMr. Cuomo accused workers of fraud and called for an investigation. The transit union\u2019s leader, John Samuelsen, likened the governor to President Trump and argued that overtime was necessary to fix the failing system.\nMr. Samuelsen even said the growing tension could lead to a subway strike \u2014 something New York City has not seen since 2005. \nA strike is unlikely, but the fact that it was raised shows how acrimonious things have grown between Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat who controls the authority, and the Transport Workers Union, an ally of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s as he ran for a third term last year.\nHere\u2019s what we know about the overtime debate:\nYes. His name is Thomas Caputo, and he was the chief measurement operator at the Long Island Rail Road \u2014 a job that involves operating a track geometry car that inspects the rails to identify areas that need repairs. \nThe overtime bonanza brought his total pay last year to $461,646, according to a recent report by the Empire Center, a research nonprofit. That is more than the salary of Andy Byford, the subway leader who makes $325,600 a year \u2014 or what Mr. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio earn.\nMr. Samuelsen defended Mr. Caputo\u2019s pay, saying that he was assigned by management to do the extra work and that he was the only employee with \u201cthat particular skill set.\u201d Mr. Caputo, who retired last month, had worked at the authority for 30 years and had seniority to select overtime assignments for other jobs he was qualified for, transit officials said.\nAnother worker, Michael Gundersen, a maintenance supervisor for the subway and bus system, earned more than $271,000 in overtime last year, bringing his total pay to $379,453.\nThe authority\u2019s chairman, Patrick Foye, said five employees at the Long Island Rail Road were being disciplined for overtime abuse. Mr. Foye has also called for an independent investigation of the problem. \nAt an emergency M.T.A. board meeting on Friday, transit officials said much of the overtime costs were for workers making urgent repairs. In 2017, Mr. Cuomo declared the subway to be in a state of emergency and created a \u201csubway action plan\u201d to fix the system. The Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North Railroad have also been plagued by delays.\nMr. Samuelsen said the agency needs more workers to implement the subway action plan.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to pay overtime, hire enough staff,\u201d Mr. Samuelsen said.\nMr. Cuomo says some transit workers have abused the overtime and attendance system.\n\u201cThis is about stealing, this is about fraud, this is about people saying they worked and charging the taxpayers when they didn\u2019t work, right?\u201d Mr. Cuomo told reporters on Sunday. \u201cThat\u2019s stealing. It\u2019s criminal.\u201d\nThe accusations from Mr. Cuomo \u2014 and his ally, Lawrence S. Schwartz, on the authority\u2019s board \u2014 have angered the transit union, which is negotiating a new labor contract with the authority. The union\u2019s current contract expires on Wednesday, though the terms will continue until a new agreement is reached.\nMr. Samuelsen said comments by Mr. Schwartz and the authority\u2019s decision to send police officers to monitor transit workers had heightened the conflict. \n\u201cThis is the type of behavior you\u2019ve engaged in that triggers strikes on the New York City subway system,\u201d Mr. Samuelsen said at the board meeting. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that as a threat. That\u2019s the truth.\u201d\nOn Monday, Mr. Samuelsen compared Mr. Cuomo to Mr. Trump, saying the governor was circulating lies about workers.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no evidence at all of widespread criminality. It\u2019s a big lie,\u201d Mr. Samuelsen said in an interview. \u201cThis is what Donald Trump does.\u201d\nDani Lever, a spokeswoman for Mr. Cuomo, said there were two separate issues: the lack of an effective time and attendance system for subway and bus workers, and \u201calarming reports of potential overtime fraud\u201d at the Long Island Rail Road. \nA strike would be, to put it simply, unpleasant. A three-day strike on the subway and bus system in 2005 paralyzed the city. \nBut in recent years, the authority has taken a friendlier tone with the union, and its workers have received significant raises. The Transport Workers Union, which represents more than 38,000 subway and bus workers, has also donated more than $275,000 to Mr. Cuomo\u2019s political campaigns through various branches of the organization.\nStill, Mr. Cuomo said he would not stand for overtime abuse, especially after the authority raised subway and bus fares and Mr. Cuomo approved new revenue streams for the agency. Mr. Cuomo recently persuaded state lawmakers to pass congestion pricing, a plan to toll drivers entering the busiest parts of Manhattan to raise money for the subway.\n\u201cThey\u2019re paying higher fares and they\u2019re going to pay higher tolls,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said. \u201cNow do your job, M.T.A. Perform and perform at a higher rate than you\u2019re now performing.\u201d", "date": "May 14, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/nyregion/cuomo-transit-workers-union-mta.html", "tags": "authority comparison samuelsen subway \u201d trump workers strike fueling cuomo threats overtime"}
