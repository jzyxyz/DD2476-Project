{"title": "With Second Ave. Subway, Cuomo Has Hands-On Role and Eye on the Future", "content": "As governor of New York, Andrew M. Cuomo has no shortage of complex problems demanding his attention. But his ire has recently been focused on a small switch in a subway station deep below the streets of Manhattan.\nDelays with the switch, known as a shunt trip breaker, were holding up progress on the Second Avenue subway \u2014 a \u201cdemonic device that has frustrated us for months,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said as he inspected a new station at 96th Street on the Upper East Side on Monday.\n\u201cThere\u2019s 800 little things like shunt trip breakers that you have to get past,\u201d the governor said. \u201cEach station has its own little problems.\u201d\nThe notorious Second Avenue subway, nearly a century in the making, is inches from the finish line, and Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, has made it his mission to complete the project by New Year\u2019s Eve. On regular visits to the line\u2019s three new stations, he obsesses over design details and equipment glitches at a surprising level of involvement for a governor, which some critics say seems primarily aimed at promoting his image.\nA 24-block trek with Mr. Cuomo this week through the new subway tunnels and stations offered a rare glimpse inside the long-delayed $4.4 billion project that for many New Yorkers had come to symbolize a dream that might never be realized. The shiny modern stations are filled with dozens of workers and a steady whir of buzz saws, but the line appears remarkably close to being done.\nYet with 18 days left in the year, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority has not announced an opening date for this first phase of the line. Though Mr. Cuomo said he was optimistic about meeting the year-end deadline, he conceded that any problems with a series of final tests could delay the opening.\n\u201cThis fire safety test could go bad, and then you\u2019re nowhere,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said after climbing a ladder onto the platform at the 86th Street station, clad in work boots and khaki pants, though notably missing the hard hat worn by others.\nFor Mr. Cuomo, the opening of the Second Avenue subway is part of an ambitious Robert Moses-style agenda to improve the region\u2019s infrastructure, which includes a new Tappan Zee Bridge and overhauls of La Guardia Airport and Pennsylvania Station. He says he wants to prove that government can do big things, but the plans also appear aimed at burnishing his legacy, possibly with an eye toward seeking higher office in 2020.\nA day after visiting the new stations, Mr. Cuomo was aboveground on Tuesday, standing in front of the Tappan Zee Bridge in Tarrytown to trumpet progress toward a 2018 opening. During the subway tour on Monday \u2014 at least his third trip to the line in four days \u2014 Mr. Cuomo marveled at the work it took to dig the tunnels as he walked along the train tracks to the 72nd Street station.\n\u201cWhen was the last time we built something that we said, \u2018Wow\u2019?\u201d he said. \u201cThis is wow.\u201d\nHis push to meet the deadline is an effort to improve the reputation of the often-maligned transportation authority, which runs the region\u2019s subways, buses and commuter railroads and is known for delays on major construction projects. Beyond the required testing, workers are still racing to finish station entrances and other final work.\n\u201cIf we\u2019re not done January 1,\u201d the governor said, \u201cI will stand up and say we failed to make the deadline, and I\u2019m disappointed.\u201d\nFor months, Mr. Cuomo has held weekly meetings at his office with the project\u2019s leadership team to address \u2014 and sometimes vent about \u2014 the latest issues and concerns. He became more involved about a year and a half ago, he said, when officials at the authority told him they wanted to push back the long-established December 2016 deadline by a year or two.\n\u201cThe meetings are not a love fest,\u201d said Charlie Hall, a construction manager from the engineering firm Parsons Brinckerhoff who is overseeing the project. \u201cThe meetings started because there were issues, and things weren\u2019t getting done. People are challenged in those meetings.\u201d\nOn an unannounced stop at the 86th Street station a few months ago, Mr. Cuomo was angered to see no one was working on a problematic escalator, Melissa DeRosa, his chief of staff, said. He walked around shouting, \u201cWho is working on the escalator?\u201d until the person appeared, she added.\nWhile many business leaders and transportation experts welcome the governor\u2019s attention to long-festering problems, some have questioned how he will finance all of the plans and his increased efforts to influence the transportation authority, as well as the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. A bitter fight at the Port Authority this month over building a new bus terminal in Manhattan led the agency\u2019s chairman, John J. Degnan, to publicly criticize Mr. Cuomo\u2019s behind-the-scenes maneuvering.\nAnd after Mr. Cuomo announced plans in October to eliminate tollbooths at the transportation authority\u2019s bridges and tunnels, some board members bristled at being asked to quickly approve the proposal with few details. James E. Vitiello, a board member from Dutchess County, expressed concern that electronic tolling could lead to lower revenue for the agency.\nThe governor\u2019s strong sway raised the question, Mr. Vitiello said, \u201cAre we a perfunctory board, or are we really a board of independent fiduciaries?\u201d\nMr. Cuomo says he wants to streamline the authority\u2019s bureaucracy. He argues he is overseeing the largest building effort in the region since the era of Mr. Moses, the hard-charging and imperial 20th-century dealmaker whose biography \u201cThe Power Broker\u201d Mr. Cuomo says he has read \u201cmultiple times in my life.\u201d Asked about their similarities, the governor said Mr. Moses was \u201cdictatorial,\u201d whereas he himself believed in a more inclusive approach.\n\u201cYou have to get it done,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you have to get it done in a way that brings the community along.\u201d\nOfficials hope to finish testing at the Second Avenue stations by Dec. 22, giving workers a weeklong \u201ccushion\u201d in case there is a problem, Mr. Cuomo said. They are unlikely to set a firm opening date for the line, which will run as an extension of the Q train, before the tests are completed. Mr. Cuomo said he did not favor an idea transit officials had discussed to possibly skip any stations that were not ready, in order to say the line opened on time.\nAs Upper East Side residents and transit enthusiasts eagerly await the opening, some advocates are focused on making sure construction begins quickly on the second phase of the line, which would extend it to 125th Street in Harlem. Others would like to see Mr. Cuomo devote a similar level of energy to the problems facing New York City\u2019s entire transit system, like slow bus service and severe subway overcrowding.\n\u201cWhen the governor puts his mind to something, it happens,\u201d said Nick Sifuentes, the deputy director of the Riders Alliance, an advocacy group. \u201cThat\u2019s what we need for the whole system.\u201d", "date": "Dec. 13, 2016", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/13/nyregion/second-ave-subway-andrew-cuomo.html", "tags": "authority second subway \u201d line future ave. hands-on cuomo station new role eye governor"}
