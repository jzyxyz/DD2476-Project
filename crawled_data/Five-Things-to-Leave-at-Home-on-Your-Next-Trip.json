{"title": "Five Things to Leave at Home on Your Next Trip", "content": "There are few things that can help reduce travel stress like learning how to pack less. I\u2019ve watched screaming couples lug massive suitcases across the cobblestones of Sicily, and seen tiny travelers miserably dwarfed by massive backpacks in train stations as often as I\u2019ve marveled at surly ones in the street frantically gathering up acres of clothes from a broken rolling bag. The tragedy of over-packing knows no bounds.\nBut before you can just \u201cpack less,\u201d you have to know what not to pack.\nVoltage converters are pretty much a thing of the past. The power adapter (also known as the \u201cwall wart\u201d) that comes with nearly every electronic product, be it a phone, tablet, e-reader, even many laptops, likely converts all incoming voltage into what it needs. Take a look at the side of the adapter, it should say something like \u201cAC 100-240V 50/60Hz.\u201d This means it can accept any voltage between 100 and 240 at either 50 or 60 cycle. So not only our 120V/60Hz, but everything from Tokyo\u2019s 100V/50Hz to London\u2019s 230V/50Hz and even St. John\u2019s 220V/60Hz.\nWhat you need instead are cheap travel outlet adapters. These change the two vertical prongs of US-style plugs to whatever the local version is. Round in Europe, tilted in Australia, massive rectangles in the UK, and so on. For about $10 you can get a few with one region/country\u2019s plug style to fit all your power adapters. For about double that, a somewhat bulkier \u201cuniversal\u201d adapter with multiple prong styles built in should work just about everywhere.\nThe exceptions to this? Hair dryers, most things with motors, and older laptops with big power bricks. If it doesn\u2019t have the voltage range listed above, or it has just a single cord direct from the wall to the device (as in, there\u2019s no adapter) it might not work. For those devices you may need a voltage converter, but more than likely, it may not work even if you have one.\nEven if I weren\u2019t bald since I was a teenager, I\u2019d still advise against bringing a hair dryer. As mentioned above, your hair dryer almost certainly isn\u2019t going to work overseas. Don\u2019t bring it. Pretty much every hotel, hostel, and most Airbnbs are going to have one available for you.\nThe same is true for things like shampoo and soap. Hotels and Airbnbs will provide these to you for sure, although they\u2019re somewhat less common in hostels. Unless you have specific products you can\u2019t live without (and that\u2019s fine, I do too), you can probably skip these. Bringing these also creates the possibility of them leaking in your bag, and now you\u2019ve got soapy underwear.\nYou also don\u2019t really need bottles of easily-obtained medications like over-the-counter painkillers. These are readily available at virtually any destination. Just remember the drug name, not the brand name. \u201cAdvil\u201d might be tough to find in some places, but \u201cibuprofen\u201d is everywhere. (Google is also handy when trying to find the name of a specific medicine in the local language, like Imodium or Benadryl.) Oh, and what we call acetaminophen (Tylenol) everyone else calls paracetamol. Same drug.\nHowever, some cold medicines, long-dose painkillers (such as Aleve), and just about anything you need a prescription for, are probably worth bringing. Just make sure you do it safely and legally.\nYou don\u2019t need to bring cash. A.T.M.s are everywhere and usually cheaper compared to those in the US. Yes, you might get an A.T.M. fee, but that will likely be less than the fee charged by retail currency converter shops like the ones at airports.\nUnless you\u2019re heading someplace particularly rural, you\u2019ll should be able to find an A.T.M. with ease. Besides, depending on the country, stores probably prefer credit cards anyway.\nAs far as credit cards go, outside the United States, American Express and Discover cards aren\u2019t nearly as widely accepted. Visa and Mastercard are far safer bets. Ideally, bring a card that doesn\u2019t charge foreign transaction fees. Wirecutter, The New York Times company that reviews products, has a number of card recommendations that don\u2019t charge those fees and offer other perks. If you\u2019re not sure about your current card, call the company and ask \u2014 and always let them know before you travel so they won\u2019t flag your foreign activity as fraud and freeze your account.\nIf you pay by card, some places will let you choose to pay in local or your home currency. Paying in your home currency will likely cost more as you\u2019ll get a poor conversion rate and a transaction fee for the \u201cprivilege.\u201d Unless you know your card charges big foreign fees, paying in local currency is cheaper.\nMobile payments, like Apple Pay and Google Pay, or apps like Venmo and Square where you\u2019re able to use your phone to buy things, are growing in popularity at home and abroad. However, these aren\u2019t widespread enough to rely on as a main form of payment. Their availability will depend not just on the country you\u2019re visiting, but the specific shop you\u2019re in.\nYou don\u2019t need a different outfit for every day of your trip. In fact, unless you have to bring something bulky that\u2019s specific to your destination \u2014 a winter parka to see the Northern Lights, custom fins to dive the Great Barrier Reef \u2014 you should be able to do any length of trip with carry-on luggage and a day pack/big purse. My longest trip so far was just under five months, and I brought a 40 liter (roughly carry-on sized) backpack, and a 15 liter day pack for my camera and other electronic gear.\nIf you\u2019re gone for more than a week, just budget two hours sometime during your trip to do laundry. Pretty much every hotel, hostel, and Airbnb will have laundry facilities in the building or nearby. (But avoid the exorbitant cost of having the hotel do your laundry for you.) Worst case, you can hand-wash in a sink. I\u2019ve only had to do that few times.\n What to pack? I usually bring six shirts, underwear, and pairs of socks, plus jeans and shorts. (You might consider adding a pair of khakis or dress pants for an evening out.) I\u2019ve met people who bring less, but enough for one week seems pretty common for frequent travelers I\u2019ve met.\nMaybe you\u2019ll go on a night out, so you need dress shoes. Or maybe you\u2019ll go riding, so you\u2019ll need that saddle. Maybe you will need a diving bell and a hang glider. But more than likely, you won\u2019t. The most pervasive and insidious thought while packing is \u201cwell, I might need this.\u201d That train of thought, and even I get it right before any trip, just results in a lot of useless bulk and weight.\nExamine what you\u2019re packing closely. Do you really want to carry that across the narrow alleys of Europe or packed streets of Asia for two weeks on the off chance that maybe, for an hour, you\u2019ll need it? Every person I\u2019ve seen with too much luggage ends up not using the vast majority of what they packed. If you do change your plans and end up needing something special, like an unexpected hike on a glacier, there\u2019s almost certainly going to be options nearby to help you gear up.\nSo leave food (other than snacks for the plane), pillows, that third pair of shoes, that second belt, boots for city trips, oxfords or heels for jungle trips, and so on. Rain gear is fine, two umbrellas in case you lose the first one is excessive.\nA safe rule of thumb: if you think you might need it, you won\u2019t. Worst case, you can buy it there. Then you\u2019ll have something new with a story attached, and what\u2019s better than that?", "date": "Oct. 11, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/11/travel/five-things-leave-at-home-on-next-trip.html", "tags": "next need things pack leave five trip home might \u201d bring every voltage like less"}
