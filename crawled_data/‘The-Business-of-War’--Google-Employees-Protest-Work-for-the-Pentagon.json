{"title": "\u2018The Business of War\u2019: Google Employees Protest Work for the Pentagon", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Thousands of Google employees, including dozens of senior engineers, have signed a letter protesting the company\u2019s involvement in a Pentagon program that uses artificial intelligence to interpret video imagery and could be used to improve the targeting of drone strikes.\nThe letter, which is circulating inside Google and has garnered more than 3,100 signatures, reflects a culture clash between Silicon Valley and the federal government that is likely to intensify as cutting-edge artificial intelligence is increasingly employed for military purposes.\n(Read the text of the letter.)\n\u201cWe believe that Google should not be in the business of war,\u201d says the letter, addressed to Sundar Pichai, the company\u2019s chief executive. It asks that Google pull out of Project Maven, a Pentagon pilot program, and announce a policy that it will not \u201cever build warfare technology.\u201d\nThat kind of idealistic stance, while certainly not shared by all Google employees, comes naturally to a company whose motto is \u201cDon\u2019t be evil,\u201d a phrase invoked in the protest letter. But it is distinctly foreign to Washington\u2019s massive defense industry and certainly to the Pentagon, where the defense secretary, Jim Mattis, has often said a central goal is to increase the \u201clethality\u201d of the United States military.\nFrom its early days, Google has encouraged employees to speak out on issues involving the company. It provides internal message boards and social networks where workers challenge management and one another about the company\u2019s products and policies. Recently, the heated debate around Google\u2019s efforts to create a more diverse work force spilled out into the open.\nGoogle employees have circulated protest petitions on a range of issues, including Google Plus, the company\u2019s lagging competitor to Facebook, and Google\u2019s sponsorship of the Conservative Political Action Conference.\nEmployees raised questions about Google\u2019s involvement in Project Maven at a recent companywide meeting. At the time, Diane Greene, who leads Google\u2019s cloud infrastructure business, defended the deal and sought to reassure concerned employees. A company spokesman said most of the signatures on the protest letter had been collected before the company had an opportunity to explain the situation.\nThe company subsequently described its work on Project Maven as \u201cnon-offensive\u201d in nature, though the Pentagon\u2019s video analysis is routinely used in counterinsurgency and counterterrorism operations, and Defense Department publications make clear that the project supports those operations. Both Google and the Pentagon said the company\u2019s products would not create an autonomous weapons system that could fire without a human operator, a much-debated possibility using artificial intelligence.\nBut improved analysis of drone video could be used to pick out human targets for strikes, while also better identifying civilians to reduce the accidental killing of innocent people.\nWithout referring directly to the letter to Mr. Pichai, Google said in a statement on Tuesday that \u201cany military use of machine learning naturally raises valid concerns.\u201d It added, \u201cWe\u2019re actively engaged across the company in a comprehensive discussion of this important topic.\u201d The company called such exchanges \u201chugely important and beneficial,\u201d though several Google employees familiar with the letter would speak of it only on the condition of anonymity, saying they were concerned about retaliation.\nThe statement said the company\u2019s part of Project Maven was \u201cspecifically scoped to be for non-offensive purposes,\u201d though officials declined to make available the relevant contract language. The Defense Department said that because Google is a subcontractor on Project Maven to the prime contractor, ECS Federal, it could not provide either the amount or the language of Google\u2019s contract. ECS Federal did not respond to inquiries.\nGoogle said the Pentagon was using \u201copen-source object recognition software available to any Google Cloud customer\u201d and based on unclassified data. \u201cThe technology is used to flag images for human review and is intended to save lives and save people from having to do highly tedious work,\u201d the company said.\nSome of Google\u2019s top executives have significant Pentagon connections. Eric Schmidt, former executive chairman of Google and still a member of the executive board of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, serves on a Pentagon advisory body, the Defense Innovation Board, as does a Google vice president, Milo Medin.\nIn an interview in November, Mr. Schmidt acknowledged \u201ca general concern in the tech community of somehow the military-industrial complex using their stuff to kill people incorrectly, if you will.\u201d He said he served on the board in part \u201cto at least allow for communications to occur\u201d and suggested that the military would \u201cuse this technology to help keep the country safe.\u201d\nAn uneasiness about military contracts among a small fraction of Google\u2019s more than 70,000 employees may not pose a major obstacle to the company\u2019s growth. But in the rarefied area of artificial intelligence research, Google is engaged in intense competition with other tech companies for the most talented people, so recruiters could be hampered if some candidates are put off by Google\u2019s defense connections.\nAs Google defends its contracts from internal dissent, its competitors have not been shy about publicizing their own work on defense projects. Amazon touts its image recognition work with the Department of Defense, and Microsoft has promoted the fact that its cloud technology won a contract to handle classified information for every branch of the military and defense agencies.\nThe current dispute, first reported by Gizmodo, is focused on Project Maven, which began last year as a pilot program to find ways to speed up the military application of the latest A.I. technology. It is expected to cost less than $70 million in its first year, according to a Pentagon spokeswoman. But the signers of the letter at Google clearly hope to discourage the company from entering into far larger Pentagon contracts as the defense applications of artificial intelligence grow.\nGoogle is widely expected to compete with other tech giants, including Amazon and Microsoft, for a multiyear, multibillion-dollar contract to provide cloud services to the Defense Department. John Gibson, the department\u2019s chief management officer, said last month that the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud procurement program was in part designed to \u201cincrease lethality and readiness,\u201d underscoring the difficulty of separating software, cloud and related services from the actual business of war.\nThe employees\u2019 protest letter to Mr. Pichai, which has been circulated on an internal communications system for several weeks, argues that embracing military work could backfire by alienating customers and potential recruits.\n\u201cThis plan will irreparably damage Google\u2019s brand and its ability to compete for talent,\u201d the letter says. \u201cAmid growing fears of biased and weaponized AI, Google is already struggling to keep the public\u2019s trust.\u201d It suggests that Google risks being viewed as joining the ranks of big defense contractors like Raytheon, General Dynamics and the big-data firm Palantir.\n\u201cThe argument that other firms, like Microsoft and Amazon, are also participating doesn\u2019t make this any less risky for Google,\u201d the letter says. \u201cGoogle\u2019s unique history, its motto Don\u2019t Be Evil, and its direct reach into the lives of billions of users set it apart.\u201d\nLike other onetime upstarts turned powerful Silicon Valley behemoths, Google is being forced to confront the idealism that guided the company in its early years. Facebook started with the lofty mission of connecting people all over the world, but it has recently come under fire for becoming a conduit for fake news and being used by Russia to influence the 2016 election and sow dissent among American voters.\nPaul Scharre, a former Pentagon official and author of \u201cArmy of None,\u201d a forthcoming book on the use of artificial intelligence to build autonomous weapons, said the clash inside Google was inevitable, given the company\u2019s history and the booming demand for A.I. in the military.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a strong libertarian ethos among tech folks, and a wariness about the government\u2019s use of technology,\u201d said Mr. Scharre, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security in Washington. \u201cNow A.I. is suddenly and quite quickly moving out of the research lab and into real life.\u201d", "date": "April 4, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/technology/google-letter-ceo-pentagon-project.html", "tags": "company letter protest \u2018 work pentagon defense military business \u201d war employees google"}
