The Council\u2019s mission is to cooperate on Arctic issues, especially how to protect its fragile environment. \nThe Arctic is heating up far faster than the world average because of rising greenhouse gas emissions, scientists have warned. Over the past five years, the region has been warmer than at any time since 1900, when record keeping began.\nDescribing the rapidly warming region as a land of \u201copportunity and abundance,\u201d Mr. Pompeo cited its untapped reserves of oil, gas, uranium, gold, fish, and rare earth minerals. Melting sea ice, he said, is opening up new shipping routes. \u201cWe\u2019re entering a new age of strategic engagement in the Arctic, complete with new threats to Arctic interests and its real estate,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said.\nHis remarks appeared to shock many diplomats and observers, because the Arctic Council\u2019s mandate has nothing to do with security issues.\n\u201cEverything has been focused on constructive cooperation where you don\u2019t bring outside problems in,\u201d said Malgorzata Smieszek, a political scientist and a fellow at the International Arctic Science Committee, a nonprofit group. \u201cAll of a sudden, the speech today shifted everyone\u2019s attention to, \u2018Are we looking at next conflict in Arctic?\u2019 when the real issue here is still climate change. No speech will change that.\u201d\nMr. Pompeo was particularly pointed in his remarks on China, which has observer status at the Arctic Council, warning that Beijing\u2019s efforts to build infrastructure in the region and partner with Russia on new sea routes could risk turning the Arctic into another area of competing territorial claims, like the South China Sea. \u201cChina\u2019s pattern of aggressive behavior elsewhere will inform how it treats the Arctic,\u201d he said. \nGao Feng, the head of the Chinese delegation to the council, said Mr. Pompeo\u2019s speech signaled the start of \u201ca new bad era.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not happy,\u201d he said immediately after the speech. \u201cIt\u2019s a country that stepped out of the Paris Agreement and then they\u2019re talking about protecting the environment of the Arctic.\u201d\nMr. Pompeo also took aim at Russia. He expressed concern about Moscow\u2019s claim over the Northern Sea Route and its efforts to expand its military presence in the Arctic.\nMr. Pompeo said that Washington was \u201cfortifying America\u2019s security and diplomatic presence\u201d in the region, including with new military exercises and icebreakers.\nAfter Mr. Pompeo spoke, negotiators continued to try to agree on the text of a declaration to summarize the work of the Arctic Council at this meeting. The United States objects to any mention of the Paris climate agreement, the global accord that calls on countries to set their own targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, several officials involved in the negotiations said. The Americans, they said, were also objecting to any mention of a major scientific report published in the fall that calls for swiftly cutting emissions to avert the worst effects of climate change.\nMr. Pompeo, speaking on Sunday to reporters traveling with him to Finland, criticized the Paris Agreement for lacking incentives or penalties. \u201cThere was literally flowery talk,\u201d he said.\nOne official involved in the council talks called them \u201cdifficult.\u201d Another said of the eight-nation talks, \u201cThere\u2019s seven countries on one side, and the U.S. on the other.\u201d\nWithout consensus among all eight member countries, the Arctic Council would not issue a declaration summarizing its work. That would be highly unusual.\n\u201cProvided we have a declaration, climate change will be addressed,\u201d said Aleksi Harkonen, the Finnish chairman of the council. \u201cIt could not be otherwise.\u201d\nFor more news on climate and the environment, follow @NYTClimate on Twitter.", "date": "May 6, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/06/climate/pompeo-arctic-china-russia.html", "tags": "arctic council warning china united states new \u201d pompeo climate russia region rattles sharp talks"}
