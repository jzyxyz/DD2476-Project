{"title": "Robert E- Lee Descendant Slams Trump Over Praise For Confederate General", "content": "A descendant of Robert E. Lee said in a video tweet Saturday that he was \u201cdisheartened\u201d to hear President Donald Trump praise the Confederate general, saying Trump is supporting an \u201cidol of white supremacy and hatred.\u201d\nTrump at a rally in Ohio Friday hailed the military skills of Lee, calling him a \u201ctrue great fighter and a great general\u201d who racked up victories against the Union \u2014 until he was defeated by Ulysses S. Grant. The president only focused on Lee\u2019s military skills and hailed Grant in his home state of Ohio. But Trump\u2019s chief of staff John F. Kelly has also called Lee an \u201chonorable man.\u201d\n\u201cLast night I was disheartened to hear Donald Trump, our president, make comments about Robert E. Lee as a great general, as an honorable man. These were far from the truth,\u201d said Robert Lee IV, who is the great-great-great-great nephew of the general.\n\u201cRobert E. Lee fought for the continued enslavement of black bodies. It was for state\u2019s rights, yes, but it was for state\u2019s rights to own slaves,\u201d\u00a0added Lee, who is an ordained minister.\nTrump\u2019s comments made Lee \u201csaddened by the state of our nation,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m encouraged because we are going to work to end this,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are going to vote. We are going to show Donald Trump that white supremacy has no place in ... our government. We are going to show him who the people are and what really matters in this nation.\u201d\nLee also criticized his ancestor as an\u00a0\u201cidol of white supremacy, racism, and hate\u201d when he was invited to speak at the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards in the wake of the Charlottesville violence. He called racism \u201cAmerica\u2019s original sin.\u201d He later stepped down as pastor of a North Carolina church because of the backlash from the speech, The Washington Post reported at the time.\nTrump has previously supported protecting statues commemorating Confederate leaders, including Lee, calling them \u201cbeautiful.\u201d\nMinutes before touting Lee\u2019s military skills at the Ohio rally, Trump urged black people to vote Republican to \u201chonor\u201d the GOP.", "date": "\n10/14/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/robert-e-lee-descendant-slams-trump-for-praising-confederate-general_n_5bc2a93de4b040bb4e82d9b6", "tags": "going e. lee e- slams trump robert confederate \u201d state general praise descendant"}
