Exams are scrapped by presidential whim. Tens of thousands of public teachers have been fired. Outside religious groups are teaching in schools, without parental consent.\nThe battle over how to shape Turkey\u2019s next generation has become a tumultuous issue for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, as he seeks re-election on Sunday in a vote that is shaping up as a referendum on his deepening imprint on the country after 15 years at the helm.\nMr. Erdogan has already chipped away at Turkey\u2019s democratic institutions, purging the courts and civil service of suspected opponents, bringing the media to heel, and leaving in place a state of emergency after a failed coup in 2016 that has added a new level of precariousness to the campaign.\nHis opponents fear that his re-election to a newly empowered presidency after constitutional changes last year will give Mr. Erdogan almost unchecked authority to push his agenda even further and fundamentally alter Turkish society.\nEducation has become a central issue as parents around the country are protesting his changes and scrambling to find schools of their choice as standards slide and unemployment swells.\nMost controversial has been Mr. Erdogan\u2019s push to expand religious education, in ways that thrill his supporters and alarm his critics.\nMr. Erdogan has made no secret of his desire to recast Turkey in his own image, one rivaling the legacy of Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, the founder of the republic and its first president.\nTheir visions for Turkey could not be more different. Atat\u00fcrk was a nationalist and secularist whose sensibility permeates Turkish culture. Mr. Erdogan is an Islamist who rose from the conservative, religious working class that most resented westernized secularism.\nEven while prime minister, six years ago, Mr. Erdogan declared his desire to \u201craise a pious generation.\u201d\n\u201cDo you expect that a party with a conservative, democratic identity would raise an atheist youth?\u201d he said, challenging his opponents about the aims of his Justice and Development Party. \u201cYou may have such an aim, but we don\u2019t.\u201d\nThe words revealed a cause close to Mr. Erdogan\u2019s heart and those of his supporters in his conservative, rural and religious base.\nFor them, the drive for religious schools represents a democratization of education and the reversal of the discrimination under the secular republic.\nTurkey\u2019s religious roots run deep, even if the separation of religion and state is well established. Even Mr. Erdogan\u2019s main presidential challenger, Muharrem Ince, has not opposed the drive for religious schools, but rather sought to seize the issue from him.\nA former physics teacher, Mr. Ince speaks proudly of his early career teaching in a religious school. He has attacked Mr. Erdogan for using the religious schools to win votes, not the schools themselves.\nBut he promises religious schools and courses will be optional, and vows to raise a generation of scientists and space engineers for the digital age.\nThe stance is clearly intended to unite an electorate that has been divided by Mr. Erdogan\u2019s program, which has replaced many secular public schools with religious ones, known as Imam Hatip schools. (The name means Cleric Preacher.)\nThe Imam Hatip schools teach the national curriculum, but roughly half their courses are religious and their core classes \u2014 those which a student has to pass to matriculate \u2014 are the Quran and Arabic.\nMr. Erdogan has vastly expanded the schools, from just 450 schools 15 years ago to 4,500 nationwide today. His government increased the budget for religious education this year by 68 percent, to $1.5 billion.\nAs the elected head of the government, Mr. Erdogan has every right to make the changes he wants, said Batuhan Aydagul of the Initiative for Education Reform, a nongovernmental organization that seeks to improve critical thinking in the education.\nEighty-seven percent of the school population is still in nonreligious schools, he noted. \u201cThis is not Pakistan,\u201d he said.\nBut especially among the aspiring middle class of Istanbul and other cities, parents have complained that Mr. Erdogan has aggressively pushed religious instruction in ways divisive, deceptive and damaging to educational standards.\nSome parents are pulling their children from the religious schools and sending them to private ones, or settling unhappily for technical and vocational schools.\nThe Education Ministry has acknowledged that 69 percent of places in Imam Hatip schools remained unfilled as late as 2016. But the schools keep sprouting up.\nIn Besiktas, a district on the European side of Istanbul, parents have been fighting a losing, two-year battle to prevent their neighborhood school from being turned into an Imam Hatip school.\n\u201cWe started with a slogan \u2018Don\u2019t Touch my School,\u2019\u201d said Gunay Imir, a retired factory worker and trade unionist whose youngest son is still at the school. \u201cThen we saw the problem was much more widespread and now we have the Movement for Secular, Scientific Education.\u201d\nThe movement coordinates activists from 20 cities around the country, she said.\nStill, the school has been partially converted into an Imam Hatip school, and religious instruction has increased.\nLast year, a class of 12-year-olds were shown a film about demons that was so violent and scary that several had nightmares, parents said.\n\u201cThe film teaches if you renounce your faith you will have this horror,\u201d said one parent, Erdogan Delioglu. Despite parents\u2019 complaints, the same film was shown to another class last month.\n\u201cThey are stealing the children\u2019s future,\u201d Mr. Delioglu said.\nIn early May, an Islamic organization visited and gave a talk to girls from the seventh and eighth grade.\n\u201cThey said don\u2019t wear leggings as it will arouse men\u2019s attention,\u201d said Oya Ustundag, an accountant who has a son in the eighth grade. \u201cThey said only hands, eyes and feet should be shown.\u201d\nIn Acibadem, a middle-class district on the Asian side of Istanbul, parents organized marches and protests at the school gates twice a week after they heard in 2013 \u2014 through the school\u2019s drivers \u2014 that their school would be demolished and replaced by a new Imam Hatip.\nWhen confronted, the principal denied any changes, the parents said. The demolitions went ahead anyway.\nSerife Arslan, who wanted a secular education for her son, could only find an alternative miles away.\n\u201cWalk around this neighborhood now and you cannot find a single neighborhood public school,\u201d Ms. Arslan said. \u201cThey are all religious schools.\u201d\nFor Mr. Erdogan, the drive for religious education is deeply personal. He was educated at an Imam Hatip in the district of Fatih, in Istanbul, and oversaw its $12 million renovation. He sent his daughter to the one in Acibadem.\n\u201cTo some extent his being a graduate of an Imam Hatip may affect him emotionally,\u201d said Halit Bekiroglu, a spokesman for the Imam Hatip Graduates\u2019 Association, who said he knows the president personally.\nIn 2017, at the reopening of his old school, Mr. Erdogan reminisced about his time there, but also spoke with bitterness about the ignorance and discrimination he faced.\n\u201cWhen I was a student here, there was no other Imam Hatip in Istanbul,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said, in comments reported by the newspaper Haberturk. \u201cSome of our teachers would say to us, \u2018Why did you come here? Are you going to be a washer of dead bodies?\u2019\u201d\nAs a budding politician, Mr. Erdogan witnessed a military coup against the Islamist government of Necmettin Erbakan in 1997 \u2014 he was a member of his party.\nThe generals forced the closing of all religious middle schools and barred the majority of graduates from Imam Hatip schools from entering university.\nAfter Mr. Erdogan became prime minister in 2003, he at first trod carefully but, opponents say, his government also began quietly transforming education in discriminatory ways.\nOnur Kaya, the former head of the education ministry for Ankara, the capital, said that the principals of 2,000 public schools in his area were replaced, 90 percent of them by people educated in Imam Hatip high schools.\nMany of those removed, himself included, were from the Alevi minority, which won a ruling at the European Court of Human Rights in 2016 against the Turkish government for religious discrimination.\n\u201cIn 15 years, they totally cleansed them from the ministry,\u201d Mr. Kaya said.\nMr. Erdogan has done much the same in a power struggle with a former Islamist ally, the United States-based preacher Fethullah Gulen, who had played a leading role in education.\nAfter followers of Mr. Gulen made a failed coup attempt in 2016, schoolteachers \u2014 34,000 of them \u2014 were purged in the crackdown that followed.\nStill, supporters say they want to see Mr. Erdogan\u2019s push for religious education expanded to meet demand.\n\u201cOn a social level, we think it is appropriate and we even consider it not enough,\u201d said Mr. Bekiroglu of the graduates association.\nFourteen percent of pupils \u2014 roughly 1.4 million \u2014 were studying in religious schools by 2017, he said. He would like to see the number rise to 20 percent in high schools and 30 percent in middle schools.\nWhen asked about their schooling, graduates of Imam Hatip schools, who had gathered to break the Ramadan fast together in a 16th century madrasa, spoke enthusiastically of the quality and camaraderie.\n\u201cVery beautiful,\u201d said Hilal Misirli, 21, \u201cbecause you study subjects others take, but also what you believe.\u201d\nBut many link Turkey\u2019s recent fall in international rankings \u2014 it dropped in the PISA index, which evaluates critical thinking, from 44th to 49th out of 72 countries \u2014 to constant disruptions and the focus on religion.\n\u201cWhen I started 18 years ago the quality was high,\u201d said Aysel Kocak, a district leader of the Union for Laborers of Education and Science, who teaches math at a technical school in Istanbul\u2019s third district. \u201cNow I cannot teach them as intensively as I would wish.\u201d\nShe pointed to a working-class district of Istanbul, in Kagithane, that has two public high schools, but seven Imam Hatip schools \u2014 five for girls \u2014 and eight technical schools.\n\u201cThis illustrates what this government proposes for low income people,\u201d she said, \u201cthat your son will end up as cheap labor and your daughter in an Imam Hatip.\u201d", "date": "June 18, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/18/world/europe/erdogan-turkey-election-religious-schools.html", "tags": "religious turkey \u2018 divides imam generation parents \u201d raise schools pious hatip plan erdogan \u2014"}
