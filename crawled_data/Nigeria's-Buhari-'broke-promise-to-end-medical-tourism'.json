{"title": "Nigeria's Buhari 'broke promise to end medical tourism'", "content": "A leading Nigerian doctor has accused President Muhammadu Buhari of reneging on a promise to end \"medical tourism\" by seeking treatment in the UK. \nNigerians spent $1bn (\u00a3690m) on foreign medical trips in 2013, most of which was unnecessary, said Dr Osahon Enabulele.\nNigerian politicians were mostly treated by Nigerian doctors in the UK, he added. \nMr Buhari flew to London on Monday to be treated for an ear infection.\nIt is unclear where the 73-year-old would be treated for what his office described as a \"persistent\" infection. \nDr Enabulele, vice-president of the Commonwealth Medical Association, said it was a \"national shame\" that Mr Buhari went to the UK for treatment when Nigeria had more than 250 ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialists, as well as a National Ear Centre. \nMr Buhari should lead by example by using Nigerian doctors and facilities, and ensure government officials do not go abroad on \"frivolous\" medical trips, he added.\nThe UK had more than 3,000 Nigerian-trained doctors, and the US more than 5,000, Dr Enabule said, accusing the government of failing to address the brain drain by improving working conditions and health centres.   \nMr Buhari, in a speech delivered on his behalf to the Nigeria Medical Association in April, said the government's hard-earned cash would not be spent on treating officials overseas, especially when Nigeria had the expertise. \nNigeria is one of Africa's biggest oil producers but most of its citizens live in poverty.  \nMr Buhari took office last year on a promise to tackle corruption and waste.
