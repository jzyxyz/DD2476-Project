{"title": "Hungary Creates New Court System, Cementing Leader\u2019s Control of Judiciary", "content": "BUDAPEST \u2014 Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary tightened his grip on power on Wednesday, as the Hungarian Parliament, controlled by Mr. Orban\u2019s far-right party, approved the creation of a parallel court system that cements executive control over the judiciary.\nOnce the new system begins operating within the next 12 months, Mr. Orban\u2019s justice minister will control the hiring and promotion of its judges, who will have jurisdiction over cases relating to \u201cpublic administration\u201d \u2014 including politically sensitive matters like electoral law, corruption and the right to protest.\nHungary\u2019s existing judiciary, which already faces significant meddling by Mr. Orban\u2019s government, will continue to work \u2014 but with a reduced mandate, and with no oversight of the parallel court system, known as the administrative courts.\nCivil rights watchdogs see the move as the latest erosion of democratic institutions under Mr. Orban, who since entering office in 2010 has created a blueprint for backsliding from the liberal democracy that took hold in Eastern Europe in the 1990s. His example has been followed in democracies like Poland, and has won admirers among a generation of populist figures in France, Italy, the Netherlands and the United States.\nMr. Orban has already spent nearly eight years undermining the independence of Hungary\u2019s courts and other institutions. He has appointed an old friend as leader of the judicial system, stacked the Constitutional Court with loyalists, altered the electoral process to favor his party, brought most of the Hungarian media under the control of his closest allies, and appointed friends and party colleagues to lead state watchdog institutions, including the prosecution service.\nThis month, he forced a leading private university to leave Hungary, and waived competition regulations to allow loyalist media owners to \u201cdonate\u201d hundreds of newspapers, television channels, radio stations and websites to a central fund controlled by three of his closest supporters.\nIn a submission to Parliament, the Hungarian government justified the new judicial system by arguing that it was in keeping with European norms, and conformed to recommendations from international bodies such as the Venice Commission, an advisory panel on constitutional matters.\nThe courts will be independent and more efficient than the existing system, according to a separate statement by Zoltan Kovacs, the Hungarian government spokesman.\n\u201cIn administrative courts, rulings would be made by judges who are more experienced, better equipped and more knowledgeable about the unique body of law that regulates public administration,\u201d Mr. Kovacs wrote.\n\u201cIndependent administrative courts exist in many other European countries, for example in Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany and Poland,\u201d he added.\nCritics say, however, that the system is a clear infringement of judicial independence.\nThe new court system \u2014 and particularly its ability to influence Hungary\u2019s election system \u2014 completes Hungary\u2019s transition from a liberal democracy to a \u201ccompetitive authoritarian regime,\u201d said Cas Mudde, a University of Georgia professor who is an expert on populism, the far-right and contemporary authoritarianism.\nMr. Orban\u2019s Fidesz Party had already tilted elections and the news media heavily in its favor, but Mr. Mudde said, \u201cwith the government also in full control of the elections, with no independent judiciary oversight, we can no longer pretend elections will be even remotely free and fair.\u201d\n\u201cThis means Hungary becomes an authoritarian regime, in which opposition is allowed to exist, but not allowed to fundamentally challenge, let alone change, the regime,\u201d Mr. Mudde said.\nOpposition parties have struggled to dent Mr. Orban\u2019s large majority in Parliament. They have been hampered by their own infighting, restrictions on private media, the failure of state institutions to investigate or prosecute allegations of government wrongdoing, and a restructuring of the electoral system that encourages small opposition parties to run individually rather than as a united bloc.\nBut opposition lawmakers did manage on Wednesday to land a rare glancing blow against Mr. Orban, delaying the parliamentary vote on a raft of new legislation, including the courts law, by blocking access to the speaker\u2019s podium inside the parliamentary chamber and blowing whistles for more than two hours.\nTheir anger was directed primarily at a piece of legislation that allows companies to force employees to work up to 400 extra hours a year, or roughly one extra day per week.\nThe government says the law is a necessary response to a growing shortage of workers, but critics fear it undermines basic labor rights, and argue that its passage through the Parliament is invalid for procedural reasons.\nSensing a rare opportunity to attract new supporters, opposition lawmakers have centered their ire on what they term \u201cthe slave law,\u201d rather than the new court system, which has primarily drawn the attention of rights watchdogs and international observers.\n\u201cWe are representing the worker class in Parliament, and we are very much focused on the slave law,\u201d said Balazs Lang, communications director for the Hungarian Socialist Party, the second-largest opposition party. \u201cPeople will have to work every Saturday, if Mr. Orban wants it.\u201d\nThe standoff in Parliament gave Mr. Orban a rare moment of public discomfort, after an opposition lawmaker, Bence Tordai, live-streamed a confrontation between them.\n\u201cAre you proud of the slave law?\u201d Mr. Tordai asked Mr. Orban. \u201cWhat would be a good name for this law? Perhaps you\u2019d prefer the serf law? Are you building a new slavery or new serfdom?\u201d\nWhen Mr. Orban reacted only with silent discomfort, Mr. Tordai said: \u201cViktor Orban is not at his best right now. The great debater doesn\u2019t have a single word.\u201d\nIn protest over the new laws, a crowd of around 2,000 people marched through central Budapest on Wednesday, briefly blocking several roads and a major bridge. Protesters gathered outside Mr. Orban\u2019s party headquarters, where two protesters \u2014 one holding a European Union flag \u2014 scaled a low balcony, before assembling outside Parliament.\n\u201cWhy did I come here?\u201d asked Sarolta G. Szabo, a 26-year-old student. \u201cIt\u2019s enough what Viktor Orban is doing to my country, my home. It\u2019s like they\u2019re going back to the Communist time.\u201d\nSome chanted \u201cOrban, get out of here,\u201d and \u201ctraitor,\u201d while others held a banner that said, \u201cStudents with the workers against the slave law.\u201d\nBut the protest against Mr. Orban was comparatively small. Mr. Orban\u2019s party won nearly half of the vote last April in a general election that election observers said was free but not fair.", "date": "Dec. 12, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/12/world/europe/hungary-courts.html", "tags": "control hungary cementing judiciary court party orban \u201d system creates leader new \u2014 law"}
