{"title": "How Rep- Steve King Almost Lost", "content": "SIOUX CITY, Iowa \u2014 Yidnekachew Yilma immigrated to the U.S. seven years ago from Ethiopia. On Tuesday evening, he was among a handful of voters inside a Lutheran church\u2019s gymnasium, casting a ballot near a basketball hoop. He walked out into the cold and the wind, the sun setting over Sioux City, smiling. He felt proud. \n\u201cI got my citizenship two months ago, so this is the first time\u201d to vote, he told HuffPost. \u201cI\u2019m excited.\u201d \u00a0\nYilma, 33, works at a meatpacking plant. The man who represents him in Congress, white supremacist Rep. Steve King, would rather people like Yilma not live in northwest Iowa, or anywhere else in America. \nKing is arguably the most bigoted member of Congress. For years, he\u2019s parroted and promoted the propaganda of white nationalists and neo-Nazis, and openly associated with fascist and far-right figures at home and overseas. \u201cDiversity is not our strength,\u201d he once wrote in a tweet.\nYilma said he\u2019d heard King didn\u2019t like immigrants. He decided to vote for King\u2019s Democratic opponent, J.D. Scholten, after seeing one of Scholten\u2019s campaign ads on YouTube. \u201cI trust him,\u201d Yilma said. \nIn the week leading up to Tuesday\u2019s election, to the shock of political observers, it seemed Scholten had a real shot at unseating King, an eight-term congressman who\u2019s routinely won re-election by over 20 percentage points in this rural, deeply conservative corner of the Hawkeye State. One pre-election poll had shown Scholten trailing King by just 1 percentage point. \nBut by late Tuesday night, the dream of a Democratic upset here was over. Scholten \u2014 a towering, 38-year-old former minor league baseball player and paralegal with a shaved head \u2014 walked around his election night party at a hotel on the Missouri River. He hugged and thanked supporters, posed for selfies and did interviews with local TV stations. \nAs the party died down, Scholten was a couple of beers deep and feeling candid. Earlier, he\u2019d done the polite and customary thing of calling King to congratulate him.\n\u201cStraight up, it sucked,\u201d Scholten told HuffPost about the call. He\u2019d lost to King by 3 percentage points. \n\u201cThe difficult thing in all of it is why the Iowa I know, the Iowa I grew up in, continues to go for King,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd honestly, that\u2019s the toughest question I have, and I still don\u2019t have a good answer for it. It\u2019s frustrating because, like, the bar of white nationalism, the bar of racism, the bar of anti-Semitism is so damn low. And we don\u2019t have a representative who can cross that bar. And that\u2019s difficult for me to grasp.\u201d \nKing has never denied being a white nationalist. On Oct. 21 he even appeared to defend the term itself, telling a local TV host that, although \u201cwhite nationalist\u201d is \u201ca derogatory term today, I wouldn\u2019t have thought so maybe a year, or two or three ago.\u201d \nYet on election night, over 159,000 people in Iowa voted for King anyway. And although there are multiple reasons for why King keeps winning here \u2014 including racism, name recognition, party loyalty and issues like abortion rights \u2014 it\u2019s maybe more instructive to consider why King came so close to losing this time. \nThere are 70,000 more registered Republicans than registered Democrats in Iowa\u2019s 4th Congressional District. President Donald Trump beat Democratic rival Hillary Clinton here by 27 points. That Scholten came within 3 points, or about 10,000 votes, of King is remarkable and shows he garnered support from Republicans.\n\u201cI\u2019m voting for Scholten,\u201d a middle-aged white woman said softly to HuffPost Monday night at a campaign rally for Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds. King, who had spoken at the rally, was standing just a few feet away. \u201cHe\u2019s too extreme,\u201d the woman, who asked not to be named, said of King. \nAlthough King has long been a bigot, he\u2019s been particularly transparent about his fascist beliefs during his eighth term in Congress. Just last month, King endorsed a mayoral candidate in Toronto who has recited the \u201c14 words,\u201d a neo-Nazi slogan. Also last month, HuffPost uncovered an interview that King had given to an Austrian publication associated with Europe\u2019s neo-fascist \u201cidentitarian\u201d movement.\nIn that interview, King pushed the anti-Semitic idea that the liberal, Jewish billionaire George Soros is funding what\u2019s called the \u201cGreat Replacement,\u201d the conspiracy theory that immigration from non-white countries spells the end of white European culture and identity. (It\u2019s the equivalent of the \u201cJews will not replace us\u201d chant at the deadly Charlottesville, Virginia, white supremacist rally last year.) \nKing had managed to espouse all this nonsense with little political consequence until late October, when the massacre of 11 worshipers at a Pittsburgh synagogue by a white nationalist brought King\u2019s own white nationalism under heightened scrutiny. Two days after the shooting, the polling firm Change Research published a poll showing King leading Scholten by only 1 percentage point. \u00a0\nSuddenly the head of the National Republican Congressional Committee felt compelled to denounce King. Corporate campaign donors, under pressure for giving money to a bigot, ditched him. The Sioux City Journal, which had endorsed King in prior elections, endorsed Scholten, whose campaign was being inundated with donations: $640,000 in one 48-hour period. \nStill, it\u2019s hard to say how many voters abandoned King because of his bigotry. When King spoke at Gov. Reynolds\u2019 rally Monday night, he wasn\u2019t interrupted by a heckler calling him a racist. He was interrupted by a 44-year-old farmer, Dolf Ivener, upset over the price of soybeans. \n\u201c$7.50 for soybeans, I\u2019m going to go broke because of you, Steve King!\u201d Ivener yelled, before being escorted out of the rally. \u201cI\u2019m going to go broke because of you.\u201d \nTrump\u2019s trade war with China, which King supports, has taken a real toll on farmers here. China bought 94 percent fewer soybeans this year from America than in 2017. \u00a0\nScholten likes to remind reporters of the Midwest\u2019s oft-forgotten history of progressive economic populism. In the 1980s, it wasn\u2019t a far-right figure like King representing this part of Iowa. It was a Democrat named Berkley Bedell, one of Scholten\u2019s political heroes. Bedell was a populist who focused on economic inequality. (Scholten keeps a photo on his phone of a Bedell campaign flyer from the \u201980s: \u201cDoes the 1% now own your government? Does the 99% have a chance?\u201d) \nScholten\u2019s campaign, which refused to take corporate PAC money, focused less on King than it did on progressive economic policies: increasing the minimum wage (Iowa has one of the lowest minimum wages in the country), strengthening unions and fighting Big Agriculture, which is squeezing farmers here for every penny they\u2019re worth. \n\u201cThe average person in Congress is 58 years old with a net worth of a million dollars,\u201d Scholten told HuffPost. \u201cI\u2019m different. I\u2019m 20 years younger and about a million dollars short of that average because, you know what, I understand what it means to live paycheck to paycheck. I understand what it means to not have health care at times.\u201d (Note: The median net worth in Congress is about $1.1 million. Over half of the members of Congress are millionaires.) \nScholten campaigned hard. For six months, he drove around in an RV he called \u201cSioux City Sue,\u201d visiting voters in each of the district\u2019s 39 counties, sometimes attracting hundreds of people to town halls in deep-red parts of the district. At night he slept in the RV, which he often parked at Walmarts. (King, meanwhile, barely campaigned here, buying his first TV ad only a few days before the election.)\nAlthough Scholten was forceful in denouncing King\u2019s bigotry on the campaign trail, he spent more time depicting King as an absent and ineffective representative. \nIt was a message that resonated with The Des Moines Register\u2019s editorial board, which called its endorsement of Scholten \u201ca no-brainer for any Iowan who has cringed at eight-term incumbent King\u2019s increasing obsession with being a cultural provocateur.\u201d\n\u201cIn his almost 16 years in Congress, King has passed exactly one bill as primary sponsor, redesignating a post office,\u201d the newspaper\u2019s board wrote. \u201cHe won\u2019t debate his opponent and rarely holds public town halls. Instead, he spends his time meeting with fascist leaders in Europe and retweeting neo-Nazis.\u201d\nHuffPost tried multiple times in Iowa to ask King\u2019s campaign about why he was polling so poorly in this year\u2019s midterm election campaign. At Reynold\u2019s campaign rally on Monday, King\u2019s son and campaign manager, Jeff King, blocked a HuffPost reporter from attempting to talk to King. \nOn election night, at King\u2019s results-watching party, Jeff King asked HuffPost to leave the building. When asked why, he instructed HuffPost to refer to his quote in The Des Moines Register. \u00a0\n\u201cWe are not granting credentials to The Des Moines Register or any other leftist propaganda media outlet with no concern for reporting the truth,\u201d read Jeff King\u2019s quote. \nOther alleged \u201cleftist propaganda\u201d outlets barred from covering King\u2019s party included the conservative Weekly Standard and The Storm Lake Times, a Pulitzer-winning newspaper based in King\u2019s district. It seemed King, known for being generous with reporters on Capitol Hill, was suddenly on the defensive. \nWith the close election results, there\u2019s hope among progressives that Scholten could mount a successful race next time. He had no name recognition when he started this race. Now people know who he is. \nOn Tuesday night, Scholten\u2019s phone lit up with text messages from big-name Democrats, including Sen. Corey Booker of New Jersey, congratulating him on running such a good race. Earlier he\u2019d heard from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California.\u00a0\nFor now, though, Scholten won\u2019t say whether he\u2019ll run against King in 2020. All Scholten knew, he said, was that he wanted eggs for breakfast in the morning and that, for now, he\u2019s just another \u201cunemployed\u201d and \u201csingle\u201d thirtysomething in America. \n\u201cIt just sucks,\u201d Scholten said. \u201cI wanted to beat him.\u201d\n\ufeffCORRECTION:\u00a0\ufeffA previous version of this story misstated the average net worth of a member of Congress as $900,000. That is the average net worth of a member of the House of Representatives. For Congress members overall, the figure is $1.1 million.", "date": "\n11/10/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/congressman-steve-king-almost-lost-white-supremacist_n_5be5f7a2e4b0769d24cd2a77", "tags": "steve iowa \u201d white night almost king rep- lost congress campaign scholten huffpost"}
