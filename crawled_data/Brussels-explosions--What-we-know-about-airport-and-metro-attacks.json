{"title": "Brussels explosions: What we know about airport and metro attacks", "content": "Bombings at Brussels airport and a metro station in the city on Tuesday 22 March killed 32 people from around the world. \nMany more were injured in the attacks. The toll does not include three bombers who died. \nTwin blasts struck the main terminal of Zaventem international airport, in the north-east of the city. \nAnother explosion hit the Maelbeek metro station in the city centre, close to several European Union institutions.\nThe so-called Islamic State group said it was behind the attacks.\nThe bombers have been named as follows:\nFrom Paris to Brussels: Why the attacks are linked\nTwo explosions, moments apart, tore through the check-in area of Zaventem airport at 07:58 local time (06:58 GMT).\nOne eyewitness reported hearing shouts in Arabic just before the explosions. \nOfficials said the bombs were detonated just seconds apart at opposite ends of the departures hall. Witnesses said people ran from the site of the first blast, only to be caught in the second, near the main entrance.\nVideo: What eyewitnesses saw\nJust over an hour later, a further blast happened at the Maelbeek metro station in the city centre, close to several EU institutions. \nA three-carriage train was just leaving the station in the direction of Arts-Loi, the next stop a short distance away, when the blast happened, according to Brussels transport operator STIB. \nThe bomb was apparently detonated in the middle carriage, which was running along the platform at the time. The driver immediately halted the train and evacuated the carriages.\nThirty-two people died in the three explosions or later from their injuries, in addition to the three bombers.\nAll have been identified, the Crisis Centre said in an update (in French) on 29 March. Sixteen of them died in the airport attack, and 16 others at Maelbeek. \nSeventeen of the dead were Belgians, and the rest were foreign nationals, the centre said.\nIn total, 340 people were injured in both attacks, and 57 victims remained in Belgian hospitals on 7 April, according to another update.\n\"What we feared, has happened,\" Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel told a news conference.\n\"We realise we face a tragic moment. We have to be calm and show solidarity.\"\nVictims of the Brussels attacks\nIn pictures: Brussels blasts\nPolice have conducted several raids across Brussels since the attacks.\nMost recently, on 8 April, Belgian media reported that Mohamed Abrini, the key remaining suspect in November's Paris terror attacks, had been arrested. \nSources cited in reports said Abrini was also likely to be the \"man in the hat\" seen on CCTV before the blasts in the Brussels airport departure hall on 22 March.\nProsecutors confirmed that several arrests had been made in connection with the Brussels attacks, but did not give further details.\nIn the aftermath of the attacks, police were approached by a taxi driver who said he had driven three men with big bags to the airport on the morning of the attacks.\nLocal media reported that the driver had refused to take one of men's large bags because there was not enough room in the vehicle. \nPolice later found a large nail bomb at the address the taxi driver gave them, along with 15kg of TATP high explosive, chemicals, detonators, bomb-making materials and an Islamic State flag.\nTATP, or triacetone triperoxide, was the explosive used by the suicide bombers in Paris. It is produced by combining chemicals sold in pharmacies and hardware stores.\nAlso found at the address was a note written by Ibrahim el-Bakraoui that read: \"I don't know what to do, I am in a hurry, I am on the run, people are looking for me everywhere and if I give myself up I will end up in a cell.\"\nWhy has Belgium's capital been attacked?\nFrom Paris to Brussels: Why the attacks are linked\nTwelve people were arrested in raids across Belgium, France and Germany on 24 and 25 March. Some have been charged.\nThey include:\nThe 'scumbag's lawyer' acting for Salah Abdeslam\nSalah Abdeslam's luck runs out\nBelgium raised its terror threat to its highest level following the attacks. \nThe UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) says in its travel advice that visitors should \"remain vigilant, stay away from crowded places and follow the instructions of the Belgian authorities\". \nUK Foreign Office warns against travel to Brussels\nCrisis information\nBrussels Zaventem airport closed after the attacks, with all flights diverted elsewhere or cancelled. \nFlights began resuming on 3 April, and the airport advises all passengers to arrive at the airport three hours before their departure time.\nThe whole metro system was shut after the attacks but was later reopened with a few restrictions.\nAirport security under the spotlight again\nSecurity measures have been stepped up in western European countries following the attacks. \nFrench Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said an extra 1,600 police officers were deployed to train stations, airports and border crossings. France has been on alert since 130 people were killed in attacks in Paris last November.\nBritish airports and transport hubs also increased security as a precaution. The UK's official terrorist threat level remains unchanged at \"severe,\" the second-highest level on a five-point scale, meaning an attack is highly likely.\nGerman authorities stepped up security measures at airports, train stations and the borders with Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, a spokesman for the federal police said.", "date": "9 April 2016", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-35869985", "tags": "airport people know explosions metro three brussels police station paris attacks"}
