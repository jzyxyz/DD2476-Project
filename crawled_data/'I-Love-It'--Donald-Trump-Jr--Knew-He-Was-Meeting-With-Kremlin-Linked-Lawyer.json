{"title": "'I Love It'- Donald Trump Jr- Knew He Was Meeting With Kremlin-Linked Lawyer", "content": "Donald Trump Jr. released images of an email exchange Tuesday that show he was contacted in June 2016 about a meeting with a Kremlin-linked lawyer. At that meeting, he was told, he could obtain \u201csome official documents and information that would incriminate\u201d former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\nTrump Jr., President Donald Trump\u2019s eldest son,\u00a0released the images just as The New York Times published a story describing the emails. An editor for the Times confirmed\u00a0that Trump Jr. posted the emails after being informed of the Times\u2019 story.\nIn an email sent to Trump Jr. on June 3, 2016, music promoter Rob Goldstone said he could facilitate a meeting to provide Trump Jr. with information that \u201cwould be very useful to your father,\u201d at the time a Republican presidential candidate.\n\u201cThe Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father,\u201d Goldstone wrote in an email to Trump Jr.\n\u201cThis is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government\u2019s support for Mr. Trump \u2015 helped along by Aras and Emin,\u201d Goldstone added. \u201cWhat do you think is the best way to handle this information and would you be able to speak to Emin about it directly?\u201d\nTrump Jr. replied, \u201cIf it\u2019s what you say I love it.\u201d\nThe documents posted by Trump Jr. show that he forwarded the email exchange to Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who is now a presidential adviser, and to Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s then-campaign manager, on June 8 \u2015 one day before the meeting took place at Trump Tower in New York.\nAs The New York Times notes, there\u2019s no evidence in the emails to suggest the meeting was related to the Russian hacking of Democratic National Committee emails, many of which were provided to WikiLeaks and released over the last few months of the presidential campaign.\nTuesday\u2019s revelation comes after an earlier New York Times story on Trump Jr.\u2019s meeting with the Kremlin-linked lawyer.\u00a0In response to that story, published Saturday, Trump Jr. claimed he \u201cprimarily discussed\u201d an adoption program with the lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, whose clients have included Russian state-owned businesses and the son of a senior Russian government official. Trump Jr.\u00a0changed his statement a day later, admitting he attended the meeting to obtain \u201cpotentially helpful information\u201d about Clinton.\nThe president has so far remained silent on the controversy, tweeting instead about Senate Democrats, the Olympics and a military plane crash.\u00a0Mark Corallo, the spokesman for the president\u2019s personal lawyer, told The New York Times on Sunday that the president \u201cwas not aware of\u00a0and did not attend the meeting.\u201d\nIn a\u00a0statement\u00a0on\u00a0Tuesday, Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s press secretary said Pence was not aware of the meeting.", "date": "\n07/11/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-jr-emails_n_5964e8b9e4b005b0fdc8815c", "tags": "jr. information jr- president new meeting trump \u201d kremlin-linked knew donald times love lawyer"}
