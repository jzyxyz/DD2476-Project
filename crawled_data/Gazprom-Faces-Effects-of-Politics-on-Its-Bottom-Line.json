{"title": "Gazprom Faces Effects of Politics on Its Bottom Line", "content": "MOSCOW \u2014 European antitrust regulators are striking at Gazprom\u2019s core, going after the Russian energy giant\u2019s pricing policies and its politically hued control over natural gas pipelines.\nBut market forces, more than regulatory pressures, are stacking up against the company, as it struggles to maintain its earnings power and geopolitical heft.\nLong used by President Vladimir V. Putin to further Russia\u2019s economic and political interests, Gazprom has used its muscle to dictate prices and set terms for natural gas supplies across Europe. This worked for years because customers had few other options.\nBut politics, Gazprom is quickly realizing, are not always good for profits.\nThose same policies are making it difficult to maneuver, as Gazprom finds itself competing against a wide array of ever more deft and efficient private drillers and shippers in the natural gas industry. In Europe, cheaper liquefied natural gas shipped from Qatar is taking the place of Gazprom gas.\nGazprom\u2019s direct role in the Kremlin\u2019s foreign policy is only adding to the challenges. As Russia has deepened its ties to Asia, Gazprom has been saddled with a $50 billion commitment to build a new pipeline to China that will take years to produce profits. At home, its substantial debts and Western sanctions over the Ukraine crisis have sharply limited its borrowing abilities.\n\u201cThe biggest problem for Gazprom is its weakness across the board,\u201d said Matthew Rojansky, the director of the Wilson Center\u2019s Kennan Institute for Russian studies in Washington. \u201cThat will apply anywhere they try to operate. They are just not the dominant force they were five years ago.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cThe difference between Gazprom today and Gazprom five years ago is its ability to think in terms of poker, to simply intimidate other people off the table with sheer resources, is gone.\u201d\nStill, politics may trump profits, when it comes to the antitrust case.\nThe European Commission accused Gazprom on Wednesday of abusing its dominance in charging higher prices in Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, countries largely dependent on Russian gas. The company, regulators said, also pursued \u201can overall strategy to partition Central and Eastern European gas markets,\u201d by reducing customers\u2019 ability to resell the gas to other countries.\nGazprom denied that it had violated any rules, defending its hybrid model that blends corporate and government strategies. Regulators, it expected, would consider that the company has \u201csocially significant functions and has the status of a strategic government-controlled business entity.\u201d\nThe model \u2014 and specifically its function for the state \u2014 is likely to complicate the case.\nEven though regulators are taking aim at a business strategy that is losing favor, Mr. Putin may not be willing to back down. Gazprom\u2019s pipeline politics have played an important foreign policy role in Eastern Europe for more than a decade.\nStill, analysts say that any forceful response is likely to wait until after July, when European Union member states vote on whether to renew financial sanctions on Russia. Russia has been hoping for an easing of sanctions.\n\u201cIf the sector sanctions don\u2019t come off, Russia will hit back,\u201d said Cliff Kupchan, chairman of the Eurasia Group. \u201cWorsening energy relations with the E.U. will be one more reason why Russia will see no downside to escalating the fight in Ukraine.\u201d\nAfter the fall of Communism, Gazprom seemed to be making a smooth transition to a profit-focused company, from its origins as the Soviet Ministry of Natural Gas. Early in his tenure, Mr. Putin put in place policies that were favorable toward investors, which bolstered profit. When the company lifted restrictions on foreign stock ownership in 2006, its share price briefly soared.\nMr. Putin compared its product \u2014 energy \u2014 to a candy everybody in Europe wanted. But he said it would be held tight in Russia\u2019s \u201csweaty fist.\u201d\nGazprom became central to a political and economic strategy of reasserting Russia\u2019s influence in the former Soviet and satellite states of Eastern Europe. Gazprom\u2019s gas sales were also a good source of revenue for the Kremlin, adding to the country\u2019s wealth of oil exports.\nCountries that offered Russia geopolitical advantages, such as the lease of a naval base in Ukraine under the former government, won lower energy prices in exchange. Those that did not were penalized, as when Russia shut off the gas going to Ukraine in 2006 and 2009 and blocked flows to Europe, too.\nBut Gazprom\u2019s strategy, the same one under scrutiny by regulators in Europe, has been losing sway.\nSales of the company\u2019s main product, gas shipped by pipeline from Siberia to European utilities, were down one-fifth in the first quarter compared with historical averages, analysts say. Liquefied natural gas shipped from Qatar and elsewhere was cheaper.\nThis year, Gazprom\u2019s base price for natural gas was about $330 per thousand cubic meters, the standard unit for gas trading in Europe. Gas offloaded from liquefied natural gas carriers from the Middle East cost about $270.\nPrices on those cargoes tumbled after the shale gas boom in the United States dried up demand outside Europe. And new liquefied natural gas operations in the United States, according to experts, may further weigh on prices. New supplies of gas are also coming online in the next decade from Azerbaijan and possibly Iran, if tensions ease over that country\u2019s nuclear program.\nWith competition rising, customers also are not as willing to sign binding, long-term contracts, the type that Gazprom has readily used.\n\u201cIt is just getting more difficult to sell its gas at its own terms,\u201d said Adnan Vatansever, a lecturer at King\u2019s College in London, who did a study on Gazprom\u2019s long-term contracts. He estimates that such contracts are set to decline by a third within the next decade.\n\u201cOn the bright side, if Europe moves towards a more competitive market and Gazprom gets convinced that it needs to abide by the rules, this may eventually help to depoliticize\u201d the perennially troubled Eurasian gas trade, Mr. Vatansever added.\nThe Ukraine crisis \u2014 and its various political ripples \u2014 are amplifying the financial pressure for Gazprom.\nAs tensions have escalated with Europe and the United States, Mr. Putin has been trying to shift Russia\u2019s trade focus to Asia. Last year, Russia struck deals to supply natural gas to China for 30 years from fields in Siberia, to be shipped via two new pipelines. Eventually, Russia could ship more gas to China than to Germany, currently its largest customer.\nBut the plan is years from bearing financial fruit for Gazprom. Just one of the pipelines is projected to cost about $50 billion, and hoped-for Chinese financing has been slow in materializing.\nIt\u2019s an expensive undertaking, particularly at a time when Gazprom already faces financial troubles.\nGazprom has $6 billion of debt coming due this year. But the company cannot easily refinance those bonds and loans. The Western sanctions target the company\u2019s banking arm, Gazprombank; it can only tap the market for short-term loans.\n\u201cGazprom was always an arm of the Russian state,\u201d said Mr. Rojansky of the Kennan Institute. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that people are finally realizing this and taking action against the Russian state, but that it now seems that Russia is vulnerable to such action.\u201d", "date": "April 22, 2015", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/23/business/international/gazprom-faces-effects-of-politics-on-its-bottom-line.html", "tags": "company faces effects natural gazprom bottom gas \u201d line europe years russia politics \u2014"}
