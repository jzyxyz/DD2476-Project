{"title": "The Liberal Establishment Suddenly Sounds Very Ambitious On Health Care", "content": "A prominent liberal think tank just put out an ambitious new health care proposal. \nThat doesn\u2019t sound like news, until you consider which think tank it is \u2015 and exactly what it\u2019s proposing.\nThe think tank is the Center for American Progress, which is based in Washington and has close ties to the Democratic Party establishment. The proposal, which its authors call \u201cMedicare Extra for All,\u201d would create a new public program, based on Medicare, that would be open to anybody.\nThe proposal, which Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar\u00a0of The Associated Press first reported Wednesday evening, also calls for automatically enrolling the uninsured, among others, in this new program \u2015 in the hopes of finally achieving universal coverage.\nSome will call this plan a single-payer proposal, because it\u2019s easy to imagine, someday, everybody being part of this new version of Medicare. Some will say it\u2019s not a single-payer proposal, because it envisions a permanent, potentially large role for private insurance \u2015 as a provider of highly regulated plans that would function more or less the way private plans for seniors on Medicare operate today.\nBut whatever the proposal\u2019s label, it\u2019s plainly a more ambitious \u2015 and more progressive \u2015 health plan than the Democratic Party\u2019s most influential thinkers have embraced in the past. And that\u2019s what makes it noteworthy.\nIt\u2019s a reflection of how far the party\u2019s internal conversation has shifted in the direction of government-run insurance \u2015 even since the 2016 presidential campaign, when Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) made a pure single-payer system the cornerstone of his Democratic primary run. It\u2019s also a leading indicator of how Democrats plan to approach health care as they start thinking about the 2020 presidential campaign.\nThe shift is real \u2015 and an outgrowth of changing circumstances in politics and policy. For most of the last few years, and especially in 2017, Democrats were preoccupied with trying to defend the Affordable Care Act from repeal at the hands of the Republicans. \nThe architects of the 2010 health care law, including President Barack Obama, understood that it didn\u2019t go far enough \u2015 that it didn\u2019t cover enough people and that it didn\u2019t offer sufficiently good coverage to enough people. \nThey had hoped to revisit and improve the law, but never had the chance. Instead, they\u2019ve ceded power to President Donald Trump and the Republicans,\u00a0who, unable to wipe Obamacare off the books, have tried to undermine\u00a0it instead.\u00a0Amid that environment, many of the program\u2019s problems have lingered \u2015 and some have gotten worse.\nBut with the threat of full repeal receding, at least for the moment,\u00a0Democrats are starting to think about what comes next. And increasingly they are thinking about public insurance as a supplement or substitute for private insurance.\u00a0\nDiscussions are underway among wonks and scholars, including a group that the Century Foundation and American Prospect magazine convened last month for a day of intense policy discussion in Washington.\n Discussions are also taking place in Congress, where some Democrats have proposed opening up Medicaid to more people, others are talking about doing the same for Medicare\u00a0and a third of the Democratic caucus endorsed the latest proposal from Sanders \u2015 which would actually eliminate private insurance altogether and give everybody a more generous version of Medicare.\nNow comes the Center for American Progress, known for reflecting and shaping the Democratic Party\u2019s consensus, with a proposal that would be among the more ambitious ideas out there \u2015\u00a0while still less sweeping than what Sanders has in mind.\nCAP\u2019s plan envisions a public insurance program that looks vaguely like Medicare but with a more generous benefit structure. (Medicare doesn\u2019t have a limit on out-of-pocket expenses, for example.) The new program would eventually absorb, through some kind of automatic enrollment, all Americans who have no insurance, are in Medicaid or buy private coverage on their own through HealthCare.gov or directly from insurers.\nEmployers could continue to offer coverage and, because of the plan\u2019s structure, it\u2019s likely most would \u2015 at least for the short- to medium-term future. But employers would have the option to buy coverage from the new Medicare plan and, critically, individual employees could opt into the new plan even if their employers were offering coverage.\nIn these respects, CAP\u2019s proposal bears more than a small resemblance to some other plans in circulation\u00a0\u2015 including one that Yale political scientist Jacob Hacker and the Economic Policy Institute\u00a0first sketched out in 2007, as well as a scheme that writer Jon Walker\u00a0put forward in the pages of Shadowproof just a year ago.\n\u201cThere is a broad consensus within the broad progressive debate that health care is a right and that everybody should have health care,\u201d Neera Tanden, president of CAP, told HuffPost. \u201cAnd we recognize the virtue of a strong public plan available to all the people.\u201d\nThe center\u2019s plan has other provisions \u2015 including a call to limit payments to the providers and producers of health care \u2015 that would ultimately raise some of the same questions Sanders plan did during the campaign. \nCutting those payments too dramatically can cause major disruptions in the health care industry, but without those dramatic cuts, any plan can quickly become too expensive. \u00a0\nCAP\u2019s idea does not envision everybody with private insurance giving up their current coverage, as Sanders has proposed, but at least some people would end up losing their existing coverage. If the experience with the Affordable Care Act proved anything, that transformation is frequently a traumatic experience \u2015 for the people who go through it and for the political system as well.\nThe center\u2019s plan is still just a vague framework, which means it leaves lots of unanswered questions \u2015 starting with the exact financing mechanism. And to conservatives, of course, it would be exactly the wrong way to approach health care \u2015 increasing spending, regulation and taxes, rather than decreasing all three.\nBut this may be a case in which a plan\u2019s details matter less than the signal it sends \u2015 about the future of the Democratic Party and maybe about the health care system as well.\u00a0", "date": "\n02/22/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/liberal-health-care-proposal_n_5a8e4385e4b0161d431869d1", "tags": "establishment plan coverage sounds suddenly proposal medicare \u2015 insurance liberal ambitious new care health"}
