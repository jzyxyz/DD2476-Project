{"title": "In a Trade War, China Might Boycott U.S. Goods. That Could Backfire.", "content": "TAICANG, China \u2014 If China calls for a boycott of American goods, Chinese workers like David Xu could be in trouble.\nMr. Xu is one of thousands of residents of this port town who cash paychecks from American companies. He works as a technician at a Procter & Gamble manufacturing and distribution center here, one of the company\u2019s biggest in China. Across town, Nike has opened a huge distribution center, its largest in Asia.\nIn all, more than 40 other American companies have set up shop here, making chemicals, lighters and a broad range of other products for a Chinese market eager for American goods.\n\u201cThere is no deep hatred for American companies,\u201d said Mr. Xu, who has worked for Procter & Gamble for 13 years. \u201cThe impact of this trade conflict shouldn\u2019t be big. After all, American companies bring so many conveniences to the lives of Chinese people.\u201d\nSome Chinese state media outlets have hinted darkly that Beijing could weaponize its hundreds of millions of shoppers should Washington go through with its recent tariff threats and start an all-out trade war. On Weibo, China\u2019s version of Twitter, there are sporadic calls to boycott Apple\u2019s iPhones. Beijing has done it before, ably punishing Japanese, South Korean and Philippine products and companies over political disputes.\nA Boycott America plan could be much tougher to pull off.\nWhile competition from Chinese-made smartphones is rising, iPhones remain popular. Shopping mall developers, eager for the extra cachet, clamor for Starbucks to open stores. Nike dominates the sportswear market in China. Chevrolet is one of the country\u2019s most popular brands.\nAnd notably, many of those products are made by Chinese workers. Factories in China assemble iPhones, stitch up Nike apparel and footwear and make Chevrolets and Fords. It isn\u2019t clear how many jobs this creates, but the American Chamber of Commerce in China said that more than one-third of its 800-plus member companies have more than 1,000 employees in the country.\n\u201cChina needs the U.S., the U.S. needs China,\u201d said Max Baucus, a former United States ambassador to China. \u201cWe are joined at the hip economically.\u201d\nThe United States has also supplied much of the investment underpinning China\u2019s economic growth. Between 1990 and 2017, America pumped more than $250 billion into China, according to a report by the Rhodium Group and the National Committee on United States-China Relations.\n\u201cThe U.S. multinationals have been playing a very critical part of China\u2019s development story, providing investment, technology, brands,\u201d said Erlend Ek, trade research manager of China Policy, a Beijing-based advisory firm. \u201cThey have a very good relationship with each other.\u201d\nThere\u2019s another reason that Beijing may be reluctant to try a boycott: American multinationals are aiding the Chinese government in some important projects. IBM and Walmart, for example, are collaborating with the e-commerce company JD.com and Tsinghua University to improve food safety in China, a priority for Beijing.\nThat isn\u2019t to say that the idea is off the table.\nThe Global Times, a nationalist tabloid controlled by the People\u2019s Daily, the Communist Party\u2019s official newspaper, warned that a \u201cpeople\u2019s war\u201d could be waged against the United States. On Chinese social media, the phrase \u201cChina is not scared!\u201d has become a popular hashtag, the People\u2019s Daily illustrating it with an image of Chinese and American boxing gloves.\n\u201cThe patriotism and collectivism of the Chinese people will likely play a role,\u201d the newspaper said in an editorial last month. \u201cAnd the slogans to boycott American cars and other big commodities may ring through the Chinese internet and get a response.\u201d\nStill, China has other ways to strike back without involving consumers.\nChina\u2019s proposed retaliatory tariffs would hit companies like Boeing. It can tell its local governments to stop buying technology from IBM or Microsoft. It can gum up business plans with regulatory hassles.\nTu Xinquan, the dean of the China Institute for W.T.O. Studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, warned that the possibility of a consumer boycott on American goods \u201ccannot be ruled out.\u201d\n\u201cBut perhaps once the battle begins, it\u2019s possible that we wouldn\u2019t even need the people to wage the boycott, because the government\u2019s measures could be powerful enough,\u201d Mr. Tu said.\nJust the prospect of a consumer boycott worries some American business executives. Despite frustrations that include opaque regulations, the weak rule of law and demands to hand over technology to Chinese partners or officials, the allure of being able to access nearly 1.4 billion consumers with the help of a huge labor force still holds appeal.\nConsumers in China can be a potent force. In 2012, Chinese nationalists wrecked Japanese stores and car dealerships and boycotted Japanese cars because of a territorial dispute, hurting sales for years. In 2016, online vendors stopped selling dried mangoes from the Philippines after a United Nations tribunal ruled in favor of Manila in another territorial dispute.\nLast year, the South Korean conglomerate Lotte was forced to shut down more than 80 stores in China after the South Korean government provided land for an American missile defense system that Beijing strongly opposed.\nMore recently, Chinese nationalists have besieged the social media accounts of Western companies that labeled Taiwan, a self-governing island that Beijing considers a breakaway region, and Tibet as countries.\nWilliam Zarit, the chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said a boycott \u201cis one of the many tools that the Chinese have in their toolbox.\u201d\n\u201cBecause of the structure of the government and the political power of the party, they can call for a boycott and get a pretty good response,\u201d Mr. Zarit said. \u201cSo that concerns me.\u201d\nTaicang, a 90-minute drive from Shanghai, underscores how interdependent the two economies are.\nSome of the biggest names in corporate America, like Honeywell and Exxon Mobil, have converged on this city of close to a million people. Its economy is growing faster than the country\u2019s as a whole. It is richer than Shanghai on a per-capita basis. Last year, Taicang topped a list of China\u2019s 10 happiest \u201ccounty-level cities\u201d for the second year in a row.\nIn a sprawling factory, Procter & Gamble makes its Head & Shoulders, Pantene and Vidal Sassoon shampoos and then distributes them along with other cosmetics and skin care products. When the factory opened, the company said it would provide 1,500 jobs for Chinese workers. Across town is a 200,000-square-meter Nike logistics center, which that company has also said would employ 1,500 people.\nIn total, 42 American factories are in the Taicang economic development zone, with a total annual output value of about $4.7 billion, the government of the much larger city of Suzhou, which administers Taicang, said in February.\nThe influx of money can be seen in the relative affluence of the Procter & Gamble employees, most of whom drive Japanese-made cars to work. One female employee, surnamed Li, said workers were confident that what they made in the factory would appeal to Chinese consumers, who she said were rational about what they bought.\nAnalysts say Beijing is aware of the importance of American companies to China\u2019s economy. Ernan Cui, a consumer analyst at the research firm Gavekal Dragonomics, said a boycott could have many victims.\n\u201cDue to the integration of the economies, whatever China does to the U.S. will end up hurting itself,\u201d Ms. Cui said.", "date": "April 19, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/19/business/china-trade-us-boycott.html", "tags": "american goods backfire china might u.s. companies beijing \u201d war chinese trade could boycott"}
