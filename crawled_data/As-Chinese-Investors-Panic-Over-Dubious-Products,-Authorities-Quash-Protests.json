{"title": "As Chinese Investors Panic Over Dubious Products, Authorities Quash Protests", "content": "In online chat groups, thousands of small investors who had put their savings into dubious digital products plotted a big protest in Beijing this week.\nUnder pressure from local officials, one woman\u2019s family begged her not to go. After a visit from the local police, a man\u2019s boss threatened to break his contract if he participated. At airports, bus and train stations across China, scores of people making their way to Beijing were confronted by police officers who urged them \u2014 sometimes with force \u2014 to turn around.\nThose who did make it to the headquarters of the Chinese banking regulator in Beijing on Monday faced hundreds of police officers sent to quash it. Some were dragged off, while others were shoved into buses leaving the city.\nFor Chinese officials, the financial is quickly becoming political.\nIn recent years, millions of ordinary investors across China have plowed their savings into online financial products that promised big profits with little risk. But the sudden collapse of hundreds of these peer-to-peer lenders in recent months has prompted a panic, leaving many investors with little information and little way to get their money back.\nFrustrated investors are appealing to local and national authorities. As many see it, the government encouraged the growth of these online lenders, which were intended to connect mom-and-pop investors with borrowers. The state, these investors say, should make them whole.\nWhile the Communist Party always tries to tamp down protests to maintain social stability, the current discontent among investors belies a bigger problem for the Chinese authorities. A vast, unruly shadow banking system, where some companies have lured people with get-rich-quick schemes, has created hidden debt bombs that could leave the economy vulnerable. And it comes at a tricky time for the leadership, as China deals with signs of slowing growth, a wavering stock market and an escalating trade war with the United States.\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe in the government,\u201d said Liu Yu, a 35-year-old shopkeeper who traveled 13 hours to Beijing on Monday to protest. He said he lost $9,000 on a lending platform called Catch the Money Cat, which notified investors on July 20 that it was having problems paying back investors and that the police in the city of Hangzhou were investigating. \u201cThere is no credibility,\u201d he added.\nWhen these digital products emerged in China a decade ago, they were pitched as an outlet for small-time borrowers, who were mostly ignored by the country\u2019s big state-run banks. For investors ponying up the money to lend, the gains were tantalizing, with some promoting returns as high as 40 or 50 percent.\nLightly regulated, they attracted ordinary people \u2014 from students to grandparents \u2014 in droves through an advertising blitz on mobile apps, in movie theaters and even in residential elevators. Many products appeared to have the government\u2019s imprimatur, since they used state-owned banks to help facilitate payments and create the appearance of safer investments. Thousands of companies pulled in an estimated $194 billion from as many as four million individuals.\nTang Zehui, 42, a factory worker who rode a 30-hour train to Beijing this week from southwestern Sichuan Province, said she had turned to these investments, as many others in China had, because the interest rate on regular savings accounts was too low.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any good ways to manage our finances,\u201d said Ms. Tang, who said she lost about $22,000 to Leadercf.com, which is based in the southern city of Guangzhou. Ms. Tang said she trusted it because the state\u2019s support seemed to be implicit.\nThe platforms were supposed to be matchmakers, providing a place for savers to meet borrowers who needed short-term loans. But with little regulation, many of these companies pooled together investors\u2019 money and then tried to find borrowers, creating a potential mismatch when it came time to pay out.\nIn 2016, they were told to register with local financial regulators and comply with new rules or face being shut down. But the deadline was postponed to an unspecified date.\n\u201cMany people see these products as similar to saving,\u201d said Yu Baicheng, director of research at Wangdaizhijia, an independent provider of data on China\u2019s online lending industry. \u201cThey are not aware of the potential risks.\u201d\nThere have been blowups in the past. The founder of a $9 billion lending platform called Ezubao was sentenced last year to life in prison for bilking investors. In January, more than $5 billion of investor money disappeared from a popular investment portal called Qianbao, which had been praised by the official state news media.\nA deeper worry started to set in this summer, after the government warned about the risk of losses.\n\u201cHigh returns mean high risks,\u201d Guo Shuqing, the chairman of China\u2019s Banking Insurance Regulatory Commission, said in June in public remarks at a conference. Any product that offers an 8 percent return, Mr. Guo said, is \u201cvery dangerous.\u201d Investors in products with returns of 10 percent or more, he went on, should \u201cbe prepared to lose all the principal.\u201d\nAlmost immediately, the concerns prompted a run on the industry, as investors demanded their money back. A wave of defaults followed, with each collapse setting off the next, like a set of dominoes.\nSome executives shut down their businesses and fled with client money, while others suspended operations following a flood of demands from investors for repayment. Many are now under investigation.\nIn early July, Money Pig, a company based in the southern city of Shenzhen, notified tens of thousands of investors that their accounts had been suspended. Trying to get their money back, investors gathered at a police station there a few weeks later. The group of office workers, students and businessmen wore face masks, sunglasses and white T-shirts that read, \u201cGive me my hard-earned money back!\u201d and \u201cGovernment, save our investors!\u201d\n\u201cI started to panic,\u201d said Chen Shuaipeng, 30, a salesman who flew to Shenzhen for the protest from the eastern city of Tianjin. He said he had $93,000 of savings in a Money Pig account before it was frozen.\nIn Hangzhou, a group of investors who showed up to talk to officials was large enough to fill two sports stadiums, according to state news media reports. Others have gathered to protest in Nanjing and Shanghai, according to news reports and widely circulated videos online.\n\u201cThe entire industry is facing panic, and the speed of collapse is still accelerating,\u201d said Xue Hongyan, director of Suning Financial Research Institute, which studies the industry.\nOfficials trying to control the situation are faced with a fast-moving crisis. In July alone, 168 lending platforms halted their operations, according to Wangdaizhijia.\nIn recent weeks, large numbers of disgruntled investors have started to share their experiences online, updating one another about investigations. Soon, investors were talking about banding together for a big protest in Beijing on Monday.\nChina\u2019s censors quickly took note, and soon one chat room after another was closed down. Investors switched between different chat apps to avoid censorship, using forums like QQ, WeChat, YeeCall, Qunduoduo and Telegram.\nMr. Gao, who asked not to use his full name for fear that he might lose his job at a machine manufacturing company, first learned online about plans for the protest in Beijing. He had lost nearly $126,000 when the lending portal Tangxiaoseng collapsed.\nAfter Mr. Gao discussed his trip to Beijing in several WeChat groups, the local police went to his home. \u201cI said one word in our chat group, and they came to my door, asking me not to go petitioning.\u201d\nBut Mr. Gao said he felt emboldened to let the government know what had happened to him. Quoting China\u2019s premier, Li Keqiang, Mr. Gao said, \u201cif you can\u2019t see sunshine where you are, please come to Beijing.\u201d\nHe went to Beijing a few days before the planned protests only to discover that a dozen government officials had visited his company and urged his boss to ask him to return. When he got home on Monday, his company asked him to sign a letter promising not to engage in protests; otherwise he would be fired.\n\u201cI think I won\u2019t be able to keep my job,\u201d he said.", "date": "Aug. 9, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/09/business/chinese-lending-platform-panic-protests.html", "tags": "authorities protests \u201c china investors beijing online chinese panic products money many government dubious quash"}
