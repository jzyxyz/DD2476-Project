{"title": "After Guaid\u00f3\u2019s Failed Effort to Beckon Military, Rival Protests Grip Venezuela", "content": "A day after the Venezuelan opposition\u2019s call for a military uprising failed, the country\u2019s political crisis returned to a protracted standoff punctuated by violence on Wednesday, with the government and protesters seeking to project strength at rival May Day rallies.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no turning back,\u201d Juan Guaid\u00f3, the opposition leader, told supporters in Caracas, the capital, where tear gas fired by riot police officers shrouded some protest sites. \u201cDespite the repression, we\u2019re still here.\u201d\nThere were reports late in the day that armed pro-government forces used live fire against some protesters in Altamira, part of a Caracas area where the opposition is strong. A 27-year-old woman died from a gunshot wound to the head while protesting there, according to local rights groups.\nThousands of Mr. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s supporters in Caracas and elsewhere heeded his call to demonstrate, although not enough to meet his promise to stage \u201cthe biggest march in history.\u201d Still, his ability to remain at large and to rally supporters \u2014 after his attempt to recruit the military to his side sputtered on Tuesday \u2014 underlined the weaknesses in the government of his opponent, President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.\nMr. Guaid\u00f3 called on Venezuelan workers to begin \u201crolling strikes\u201d starting Thursday, building to a general strike later in the month. It was unclear how much pressure that would apply since most companies already operate at minimum capacity after five years of recession.\nThe protest against Mr. Maduro on May Day, a national holiday for workers in Venezuela, was a test for Mr. Guaid\u00f3 in his ambition to claim the leadership of a country suffering from a crumbling economy that has left the population lacking food and medical care.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how many in the military support us, but change has begun,\u201d said Rafael Rondon, a retiree who joined the protest in eastern Caracas. \u201cThe soldiers have families and the same needs as us.\u201d\nWhile the opposition has received the backing of more than 50 countries since Mr. Guaid\u00f3 proclaimed himself interim president more than three months ago, its momentum on the street has flagged. Protest fatigue and constant power and water outages have sapped morale.\nAttempts by Mr. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s supporters to gather at rallying points in Caracas\u2019s downtown Wednesday were swiftly repressed by police officers and national guard members with tear gas, forcing them to fall back to the middle-class opposition stronghold of Chacao in the east of the capital. Thousands of opposition supporters, dressed in the national colors and waving Venezuelan flags, packed Chacao\u2019s Altamira Plaza by midafternoon to hear Mr. Guaid\u00f3 speak.\nHe never came, canceling his speech as pro-government security forces tightened cordons around the capital.\nSome protesters showed frustration at Mr. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s failure to persuade enough military officers to switch sides despite the massive collapse in living standards and the tightening of American sanctions.\n\u201cIf the soldiers were really on our side, we wouldn\u2019t be in this situation,\u201d said Yaneyfer Sayago, a former clothing vendor whose stall went bust in the economic crisis.\nNear the Chacao rally, a few hundred masked youths armed with stones and Molotov cocktails fought running battles with national guard members around the perimeter of La Carlota air base, which on Tuesday became the epicenter of a skirmish between loyalist soldiers and a few dozen national guard members who switched allegiance to Mr. Guaid\u00f3.\nChacao\u2019s health authorities said 39 protesters were injured on Wednesday. The defense minister, Vladimir Padrino, said on Twitter that eight soldiers had been wounded by firearms while \u201cconfronting coup violence.\u201d He added, \u201cHow long will the impunity last?\u201d\nAcross town in central Caracas, thousands of Mr. Maduro\u2019s supporters dressed in red marched along the main highway toward the presidential palace. Most appeared to be retirees or public sector workers. Many were brought in from across the country by public buses that stretched for miles on the side of the highway.\nIt was one of the biggest pro-government demonstrations in Caracas in months, underlining the government\u2019s desire to portray strength and tenacity after the failed uprising.\nThe United States backed Mr. Guaid\u00f3 from the start and has remained a stalwart supporter. The Trump administration would prefer a peaceful transition, said Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, but he restated in an interview with the Fox Business Network Wednesday morning that \u201cmilitary action is possible.\u201d\n\u201cIf that\u2019s what\u2019s required, that\u2019s what the United States will do,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said.\nMr. Guaid\u00f3 tried to jump-start the drive to remove Mr. Maduro on Tuesday, appearing at a military base alongside Leopoldo L\u00f3pez, the country\u2019s best-known political prisoner. Mr. L\u00f3pez had apparently been freed by security forces, leading many to speculate that a rebellion against Mr. Maduro might be afoot.\nBut no major military defections were reported, and in the streets, forces loyal to Mr. Maduro clashed with protesters. More than 70 people were wounded on Tuesday, according to a hospital that treated them.\nMr. L\u00f3pez eventually fled to the Spanish Embassy in Caracas.\nThe United Nations human rights office in Geneva said it was \u201cextremely worried\u201d about the possibility of excessive force against peaceful demonstrations.\n\u201cWe call on all sides to show maximum restraint and on the authorities to respect the right of peaceful assembly,\u201d said a spokeswoman, Marta Hurtado. \u201cWe also warn against the use of language inciting people to violence.\u201d\nMr. Maduro has said he will not back down.\n\u201cWe are over the shock and surprise, and now we will take this all on with nerves of steel,\u201d he said in a televised address on Tuesday night.\nIn Washington, American officials said they believed top government officials had been preparing to turn on Mr. Maduro. Mr. Pompeo said that Mr. Maduro had been prepared to leave the country for Havana, but that he had decided against fleeing at the behest of Russia.\nA Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, denied Mr. Pompeo\u2019s assertion. \u201cWashington tried its best to demoralize the Venezuelan Army, and now used fakes as a part of information war,\u201d she told CNN.\nRussia, an important backer of Mr. Maduro, also said Wednesday that it had warned the Trump administration against meddling in Venezuela. The message was conveyed in a telephone call between Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov and Mr. Pompeo, Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry said in a statement on its website.\n\u201cIt was stressed on the Russian side that Washington\u2019s interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state, the threat against its leadership is a gross violation of international law,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe continuation of aggressive steps is fraught with the most severe consequences.\u201d", "date": "May 1, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/01/world/americas/venezuela-protests-guaido-maduro.html", "tags": "guaid\u00f3 effort military protests \u201c maduro venezuela grip opposition supporters failed rival caracas said beckon"}
