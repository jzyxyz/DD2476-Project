{"title": "Lena Headey 'Broke Down In Tears' After Wrapping 'Game Of Thrones'", "content": "\u201cI didn\u2019t think I was going to be emotional,\u201d Lena Headey told me when I asked her how it felt to bid farewell to the deliciously deceitful character who made her a household name.\u00a0\nSince 2011, the actress has been playing the role of evil queen Cersei Lannister on HBO\u2019s globally successful series\u00a0\u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d which will debut its eighth and final season in April. She wrapped her last scenes as Cersei back in July, but the moment she walked off set is ingrained in Headey\u2019s memory.\u00a0\n\u201cIt was [sad], yeah,\u201d she told HuffPost while promoting her new movie \u201cFighting with My Family,\u201d in theaters now. \u201cI thought I wasn\u2019t going to let myself get to that point because I had the last day to get through. And then when I left and I got in the car, I broke down in tears and I was,\u201d she paused, \u201cyeah, devastated.\u201d\u00a0\nHer co-star and on-screen brother-lover Nikolaj Coster-Waldau had similar feelings when it came to completing his run as Jaime Lannister.\u00a0\n\u201cIt was a little bit emotional at the very, very end,\u201d he told HuffPost last year. \u201cIt\u2019s also just a build-up because throughout the season we had a lot of teary goodbyes and farewell dinners. When my turn came around, I really didn\u2019t think it was going to faze me, but I have to admit that right when they said, \u2018This is a series wrap for Nikolaj,\u2019 there might have been a tiny bit of moisture in the air, just around my eyes,\u201d Coster-Waldau added, laughing.\u00a0\nCrying after the end of a physically and emotionally draining shoot is understandable, but Headey, for one, was also reflecting back on what the Emmy-winning series has done for her career.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cI mean, listen,\u201d she explained, \u201cwe all know if you\u2019re visible, people look at you differently. You\u2019re allowed in rooms you were never allowed in before, you get meetings with people, and people listen to what you have to say. So in regards to that, it\u2019s obviously changed my ability to start making and doing and developing things, which I\u2019m thrilled about. I\u2019ve wanted to do that for a long time. \u2018Thrones\u2019 changed my life in that way, and I\u2019m incredibly grateful.\u201d\u00a0\nHer hope is to focus on directing, as well as star in and produce future projects. As for whether or not she\u2019s nervous to find well-rounded roles after portraying someone as dynamic as Cersei,\u00a0Headey said no, adding that she\u2019s always looking to play women who are more than just \u201cthe wife\u201d or \u201cthe mother.\u201d\n\u201cNobody wants to play a character who\u2019s really fucking dull and has no history,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s always more interesting for me whether it\u2019s a history that you create for a fictional character or one you look into while researching real people. Everyone has a story. You have to bring that story with you.\u201d\nSpeaking of story, fans have been clamoring for any and all details in the lead-up to the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d Season 8 premiere, knowing full well that the tight-lipped cast is in possession of knowledge that will most likely blow their minds.\u00a0\nHeadey, unfortunately, only offered up one little tidbit of information: that she\u2019s \u201cabsolutely satisfied\u201d with the series finale. \u201cCan\u2019t say any more than that,\u201d she added, delightfully cackling at my request for spoilers.\u00a0\nShowrunners Dan Weiss and David Benioff, as well as A Song of Ice and Fire creator George R.R. Martin, have gone to great lengths to keep the plot summaries of the final six episodes completely secret \u2015 going as far as allowing actors only 24 hours with the scripts and staging fake scenes to throw off paparazzi on set. But in the end, it will all be worth it, according to Coster-Waldau.\u00a0\n\u201cI wrote the writers when I finished reading and just said, \u2018I don\u2019t think you could\u2019ve done a better job at finishing this story,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, it was very satisfying but also very surprising and all the things that I was hoping for. It still made sense. It wasn\u2019t like one of those where the killer is suddenly revealed in the last act and you go, \u2018Oh! I didn\u2019t see that coming.\u2019 Here, they\u2019ve done a really, really good job.\u201d\u00a0\nSeason 8 of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d premieres April 14 on HBO.\u00a0", "date": "\n03/02/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/lena-headey-game-of-thrones-final-season_n_5c780232e4b0d3a48b5780d6", "tags": "going really thrones season series \u201d wrapping last headey tears lena"}
