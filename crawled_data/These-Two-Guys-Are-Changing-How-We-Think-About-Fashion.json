{"title": "These Two Guys Are Changing How We Think About Fashion", "content": "\u201cRULE-BREAKING\u201d IS A PHRASE thrown around in fashion a lot. But who makes these rules? And aren\u2019t rules what fashion is based on? After all, fashion isn\u2019t just the clothes on your back. \u00adIt\u2019s the form of those clothes at a given moment, adhering to certain codes that define them as forward-thinking, as now, as \u00e0 la mode. Which often, as on a menu, translates simplistically to a lump of something fancy plopped on top of an existing offering, as opposed to tinkering about with the guts or really changing anything. Rules in fashion are made by the industry: the editors, the designers, the corporations who fund the whole thing. And so, genuine rule-breakers don\u2019t come along that often. Fashion enjoys the status quo. It sells clothes, it makes money.\nBut what if the rules are broken? People have stopped buying clothes with quite the alacrity they used to, and large conglomerates have begun to see their profits slip southward. Designers are fleeing houses after a few short seasons. Plenty of brands, rattled by the instability of luxury markets, are now trying to close the gap between runway and retail, offering goods ever faster to consumers, hoping to whip them into a frenzy of acquisition. There\u2019s a general unease in fashion, to say the least.\nAnd the clothes themselves? They wind up bit players in the Sturm und Drang of it all, overshadowed by financial finagling and designer wrangling, when they should be the focus of the conversation. There is a glut of clothing at every price point, especially in high fashion, where labels proliferate and multiple seasons (spring, prefall, winter, resort, capsules galore) concurrently jostle to justify a seemingly endless influx of clothing. But how much of that actually connects with what people really want to wear today? How they want to look, maybe even feel? The soft sell, rather than the hard?\nIt matters, at least, to two. One is the designer Alessandro Michele, who after anonymously toiling away at Gucci for 12 years, was appointed creative director of the 95-year-old Florentine brand in January 2015. In three seasons, the 43-year-old Italian has managed to entirely remake the brand, pulling back from its sexy image to explore a more romantic side. The other is Demna Gvasalia, a 35-year-old Georgian from the former Soviet Union, who started his Paris fashion collective Vetements in 2014 after working at Maison Margiela and Louis Vuitton, where he became frustrated with the increasing demands of the fashion industry. Six months ago, based on the sheer strength of his fledgling streetwear-based label, he was named the artistic director of Balenciaga, the century-old French house, in a twist that shocked the industry given Gvasalia\u2019s distinct lack of star power \u2014 similar to Michele\u2019s out-of-the-backroom appointment. He debuted his first collection for Balenciaga last month to ecstatic reviews.\nRelative anonymity is the immediate connection between Gvasalia and Michele, but there's something deeper at play than the fact that, until 15 months ago, you'd probably never heard of either. Gvasalia's frustration is quietly mirrored by Michele, who has said that he'd planned to leave Gucci before being surprised with the creative director offer. More than that, there\u2019s a synergy between their approaches to gender lines \u2014 ignoring them \u2014 and to the runway, which they use to actually show clothes, not just to stage a spectacle. They both talk frequently, incessantly, about clothes, rather than fashion; about reality, about appealing to, and ultimately dressing, the girl (or guy) on the street.\nBut their streets are worlds apart. Gvasalia and Michele\u2019s aesthetics are diametrically opposed. Gucci\u2019s embroidered and preciously embellished clothes look like family heirlooms; Vetements\u2019 seem fresh from the trash bag, jumbled and crumpled and intentionally misshapen. Gvasalia\u2019s Balenciaga adds a third element to the mix, focusing on a \u201ccouture attitude,\u201d on the way garments are worn and their relationship with the body. These included embroidered evening dresses and strict tweed suits with exaggerated basques, as well as curving parkas and Perfecto-style jackets based on grand opera coats. The architecture of the garments at Balenciaga and Vetements is exciting, innovative.\nThat even includes the standard T-shirt, cut long in the body at Vetements with stiffened sleeves or a high-\u00adrise neckline, as if being worn back to front. Other garments are cut too small or too large, and sit unusually on the body. They\u2019re often made of synthetic fabrics like velour and nylon. By contrast, Gucci\u2019s clothes are generally simplistic in shape (track tops, single-\u00adbreasted blazers, bowed blouses, a predilection for a 1970s flare) with a focus on shimmering surfaces and overloaded detailing: sequins, custom-\u00adwoven jacquards, buttons in the form of jeweled lion\u2019s heads or gumdrop pearls, sleeves dipped in mink.\nHowever different their collections, though, Gvasalia and Michele\u2019s ideas about fashion are interwoven. The connection is the moment, the collective nerve they seem to have touched in the cultural consciousness. People identify with the aesthetics these designers are proposing, with the \u201cuniverse\u201d their clothing represents, as badges of belonging. At Vetements\u2019 fall show, high-school-age fashion fans thronged a church in the Eighth Arrondissement, dressed in Vetements and vintage mashed together, emulating the appearance of the similarly teenage street-cast models. It was difficult to see where the runway ended and reality began. In Milan, Gucci\u2019s models were outnumbered by audience members wearing Michele\u2019s fur-lined house slippers, chinoiserie jackets and foliage-festooned accessories. The newly revamped Gucci store on Via Montenapoleone was mobbed all week long, and not just by fashion types. Michele is pulling in consumers who previously felt put off by Gucci\u2019s hedonistic repute, but who now feel drawn to its beautifully \u00admade jackets, dresses heavy with embroidery, handbags patterned with flowers or embroidered with bees. \u201cTake it,\u201d Michele told me backstage before his last Gucci men\u2019s wear show, gesturing at the heaving rail of soon-to-be-shown Gucci wares. \u201cMake it yours.\u201d\nTHAT\u2019S THE APPEAL of many of these clothes: Rather than a tub-thumping, dictated silhouette, both Gvasalia and Michele propose individual, individualistic items, designed to stand by themselves. They\u2019re clothing people, not \u201cfashioning\u201d them. The collections themselves include countless styles, worn every which way. There\u2019s no trend, no given shape, no definitive singular statement. Their work turns on its head the previously predominant idea of the \u201ctotal look,\u201d of a designer proposing an outfit to be sold head-to-toe. (Incidentally, these \u201clooks,\u201d which have dominated the past decade or so of fashion, are also often strictly proscribed to be photographed for magazines as such, ensuring a singular retail and marketing vision.) Both Gvasalia and Michele conceive their garments as individual entities: a great jacket, a great skirt, a good dress, nice shoes. They mix it all together on the runway, but the notion is to pull it apart into individual pieces. Gvasalia even named his label Vetements \u00adbecause, \u201cit\u2019s really just about that ... just clothes,\u201d he once told me.\nTheir clothes also don\u2019t change much from season to season, which is breaking another rule: that of perpetual change, of fashion simulating newness purely by its contrast with that which came before. Gvasalia and Michele\u2019s clothing may not be designed, specifically, for seasons to be jumbled together. But they can be. Their greatest provocation to the establishment has been to eschew the industry\u2019s built\u00ad-in obsolescence, to challenge the very fabric of time.\nTogether, what they are proposing ideologically is affecting the way other designers think, how they design and subsequently how we all dress. First and foremost, Gvasalia and Michele\u2019s work feels exciting because it aims outside of fashion\u2019s insular bubble. There\u2019s a pragmatism behind the collections of both. They frequently talk about \u201cwardrobes,\u201d about \u201creality,\u201d one that actually feels authentic rather than some fashion construct. At the fall shows, many designers seemed intent on reflecting the way real people dress, as opposed to cold and calculated \u201censembles.\u201d That\u2019s the influence of Gvasalia and Michele.\nIt\u2019s a magpie approach to dressing, trying to please all of the people all of the time. They\u2019re about choice, about freedom \u2014 a word Michele uses often. In effect, they\u2019ve surrendered the power designers previously held over customers, in which a designer\u2019s specific eye and taste deemed what was an acceptable, even cool, way to dress. Gvasalia and Michele have collapsed the very perception of fashion as rule-maker.\nWe\u2019ve reached the point in fashion where focusing on the garments, as opposed to the gumpf fluffed about them, constitutes rule-breaking. The individual \u2014 the individual customer, the individual garment, the individualist look rather than the one dictated by a fashion designer or a fashion magazine \u2014 is at the root of their success. It\u2019s something that had been missing in fashion. Vetements is only in its fifth season, but Gvasalia has more than a hundred stockists worldwide, where his clothes consistently sell out. Gucci sales under Michele have exceeded analysts\u2019 expectations, rising 13.4 percent in the final quarter of 2015, to $1.2 billion.\nBack in 1989, the late John Fairchild, legendary publisher of Women\u2019s Wear Daily, hypothesized that fashion hangs from six designers by a golden thread. That they were referenced and ripped off by a legion of others. \u201cAll eyes are on these six,\u201d stated Fairchild, in his book \u201cChic Savages.\u201d \u201cThey show the rest of the industry where to go.\u201d Now there are even fewer. We brought Michele and Gvasalia together three hours after Gvasalia\u2019s Balenciaga debut, and two hours before Michele returned to Rome to begin designing Gucci\u2019s spring 2017 collection. The two had never met before.\nAlexander Fury: It\u2019s interesting getting you to talk together for the first time because what you do is, on the surface, so immediately, incredibly different. Your aesthetics are opposed, and yet there are so many underlying similarities. Alessandro, you\u2019ve spoken to me about strange ideas of beauty; and Demna, you\u2019ve said of Vetements: \u201cIt\u2019s ugly, that's why we like it.\u201d\n[Gvasalia laughs]\nAlessandro Michele: But ugly is beauty. No?\nDemna Gvasalia: I think that beauty is in everything, if you look for it. I mean it\u2019s too easy to say something is classically beautiful. It\u2019s clear for everyone. You don\u2019t need to think.\nMichele: A hidden beauty. I was talking with Miuccia [Prada] in Milan, and she told me something really funny, but it was true. She told me: \u201cWhen I started in fashion, everything was about super-beautiful, aggressive, polished beauty. And I arrived, with these kind of ugly girls. They really criticized me a lot, for years and years.\u201d\nGvasalia: Until they understood.\nMichele: Yes, until they understood. \u201cIt\u2019s easier for you,\u201d she told me. Because now it\u2019s a bit different. But I think it\u2019s always hard, because when you change the language, they need time ...\nGvasalia: To digest it.\nFury: Which I suppose is now the same with you coming to Balenciaga. The work of both of you, at Balenciaga and Gucci, is about unexpected sides of those labels. They\u2019ve always been there, but they weren\u2019t as publicized.\nGvasalia: Because it\u2019s a new story, I think. That\u2019s also what makes it exciting. You have a base, this amazing platform, but then you make something new, that works with what was there before.\nMichele: I think also that every single designer sees something different in the same brand. I think that creative work is what you see through your eyes. It\u2019s like ... when I think about Gucci, I was trying to find the most crazy piece of the company. Because after a lot of years, Gucci for me was, in a way, flat. Without soul. But in the archive you can find a lot of quirky soul. They created a lot of strange kinds of objects. I think that my job could be easy, because we don\u2019t have a ready-to-wear story, so you can invent what you want. It\u2019s just about travel, suitcases, leather goods. But I was obsessed with this idea of the jet set that, honestly, I don\u2019t think exists anymore. I don\u2019t want to talk with something that is completely dead. But now, the street \u2014 I\u2019m obsessed, like you, with the street.\nGvasalia: Because it\u2019s also something you see.\nMichele: Yes.\nGvasalia: And you see it through your filter. I think the normality, in a way, has so many ways of being inspiring. And you can do so much with it actually. With what you see.\nFury: It\u2019s challenging, too. How can you make normality interesting?\nGvasalia: And then also clothes that are wearable that people desire. That they say, \u201cI need to have that thing.\u201d I think that\u2019s also something that, somehow ... you do a show and then in the store, half of those pieces wouldn\u2019t be there. Which doesn\u2019t make any sense. To really have this kind of honesty.\nFury: Traditionally, very little of what designers create for the shows actually winds up in stores for sale. It just exists to be photographed. Is it a vital part of your creative process that the pieces in the runway show will be the bulk of what\u2019s produced to sell?\nMichele: Yes. Reality is a huge piece of our work. I think that fashion, for a long time, has been in a prison. Without freedom. I think that without freedom, with rules, it\u2019s impossible to create a new story. I mean, I\u2019ve worked in fashion for a long time \u2014 but I understand that after years and years of product, product, product. It\u2019s something that kills everything. Also the market. A product without an idea, a soul, an attitude. If you don\u2019t give people the idea that they belong to a tribe ...\nGvasalia: They need that.\nMichele: They need that.\nGvasalia: And that\u2019s very much what\u2019s happening now, I think. It\u2019s very much what\u2019s happening with what you do. And in such a short period of time, also. This is quite amazing \u2014 it\u2019s \u00adactually a virtue of our time, on one hand, because everything is so fast. People need to belong. Identifying them, as, well, \u201cWe\u2019re part of that.\u201d For me I have this very much at Vetements right now, but at Balenciaga the challenge is to create that. It\u2019s a following in a way.\nMichele: You don\u2019t just work with the length of the skirt. Who cares? Now, I think nobody cares. We\u2019ve seen every length of skirt ... I think that you have to give something different. And the most important thing now is also to give a real attitude to fashion. Because people want you to suggest the idea that you can really put together and create a personal point of view. You have to belong to a brand that has a story, because obviously a brand needs an aesthetic. But you need also to suggest the idea of freedom. Because when you go in the street, people are free to do what they want. There are no rules.\nGvasalia: And they choose what they buy.\nFury: I think it\u2019s interesting that you both talk about attitude.\nGvasalia: That is such a key element I think. You know, when you see someone wearing Gucci \u2014 you know that she\u2019s a Gucci woman. It\u2019s so visual.\nFury: There\u2019s also that idea that sometimes someone wears it who maybe ... doesn\u2019t have the right attitude.\nGvasalia: But it makes her have it. It makes her. And I think that\u2019s why they want it also, because they want that attitude. That look. That maybe they don\u2019t even have.\nFury: Demna, do you find it difficult to think in doublespeak, to have an attitude for Vetements and an attitude for Balenciaga?\nGvasalia: It helps me. At the beginning it was like, okay, it\u2019s going to be like Jeykll and Hyde and I\u2019ll go crazy. But I must tell you, having those in-between moments \u2014 it\u2019s like cold and hot showers. I go back and I forget about that day I spent at Balenciaga. It freshens me. For me, it really helps, creatively.\nFury: It\u2019s interesting that in your work you\u2019ve both collapsed the idea of trends. That\u2019s been dying for a long time, but fashion has been clinging onto it, as a way of categorizing all these different collections. Does that whole idea of seasonality matter?\nGvasalia: In terms of temperature? [Laughs] That\u2019s a bit confused! We deliver puffer jackets in June \u2014 and I really don\u2019t know people who buy puffer jackets in June, unless they\u2019re a fashion victim. I think that doesn\u2019t work. But seasons \u2014 the continuation, the consistency \u2014 is important. Especially when you\u2019re re-establishing or redefining the identity of a brand. I think there you really need to kind of hammer that. In \u00adslightly different ways, fresher, etc. But I think it\u2019s necessary to have that. So it doesn\u2019t look like a design exercise, every six months. I think in the \u201990s there were a lot of brands who did that. I know Margiela did it. Every six months, it had to be a new concept. Otherwise it\u2019s not strong enough. And the concept had to be so strong. It\u2019s not relevant anymore.\nMichele: It\u2019s another world. It was another era. Now the world is completely different. The customers are different. You can\u2019t repeat for a long time the same rule. Because at the end the market will stop. Now, I think that customers are ready to decide by themselves what they want to mix and match. It\u2019s not the idea of total look. It\u2019s not fresh anymore, I don\u2019t think.\nGvasalia: Because people look for that kind of individuality. They don\u2019t want to look like a campaign picture. They choose. At the end, maybe they end up [like that] but it\u2019s their decision, of how they want to stand out. Because we're so globalized and everything is so out there right away. I think there is this desire and need for being a bit different. That's why the individuality matters much more.\nFury: I think also with the way that both of you work, there\u2019s a lot of focus on individual items, as opposed to that total look. It\u2019s very much about making one thing precious.\nMichele: For me, nothing is old. I don\u2019t know why. If a dress is beautiful, and it\u2019s very \u00adpersonal, I think it can live forever. I think that we still have the idea that if you have something beautiful, next season you have to put it in the bin.\nGvasalia: It\u2019s terrible.\nMichele: This is horrible.\nGvasalia: It\u2019s also bull.\nMichele: I don\u2019t care about which season it is. Sometimes I prefer it after seasons and seasons.\nGvasalia: Often when you have the continuity between seasons, you don\u2019t have this problem. It\u2019s still relevant, in the context. It\u2019s like, \u201cOh, it\u2019s Prada last summer.\u201d If you love it, you love it. You don\u2019t care which season it is. I write the seasons on the labels of all the clothes at Vetements, for example, and the sales people at the beginning said: \u201cOh you can\u2019t do this, people won\u2019t want to wear it the year after.\u201d No, they will. And actually I think it\u2019s even an added value. It\u2019s something that continues, and still works.\nFury: That\u2019s an idea everyone seems to be connecting with \u2014 the way they\u2019re connecting with the way your clothes look, too. Do you realize that other people are feeding off the ideas that you are putting out? Can you see that fashion has shifted?\nMichele: I mean, when you work, you don\u2019t think about that kind of thing. But it\u2019s clear that something is happening. I don\u2019t know what.\nGvasalia: I think we\u2019re just happening at the right time. Also, that fashion realizes that things need to be rethought. That\u2019s why it has an impact, probably. I don\u2019t know. Actually questioning those things: I think, asking those questions makes the whole industry evolve. I think that\u2019s the impact, actually. The question of seasons, continuity, etc. I think that\u2019s what makes an \u00adimpact.\nFury: That your work is challenging these ideas that people have begun to question in themselves already.\nGvasalia: Me, I never think of that working on the collection.\nMichele: No, no.\nGvasalia: Because it\u2019s more natural. It\u2019s what I think is right. It\u2019s exactly not following rules, that\u2019s what makes it happen. Because for me, these rules don\u2019t matter. And I try to invent these other rules that work for us. And maybe other people want to appropriate those. But it doesn\u2019t always work, either. You can\u2019t always use the same model.\nMichele: I think it\u2019s the best thing you can do: if you try to feel that something is happening. I\u2019m only talking about me, because I\u2019m new in this business. I\u2019m having fun \u2014 I don\u2019t think about it. But probably if I\u2019d been on the scene for a long time, I think I would see that something changing is a good reason to express your point of view. Not to copy. I saw, for example, last season everywhere that kind of strange decoration. But fashion is not about decoration [he strokes a hand across the metallic embroidery on his own Gucci jacket], fashion is not about the wrong size [gesturing to Gvasalia\u2019s oversized coat, as Gvasalia laughs]. You have to find your language. If you try to repeat something that is not you, your language, it doesn\u2019t work.\nGvasalia: It\u2019s true. They see how it works at Gucci, so we should also do that.\nMichele: Full of birds everywhere! Flowers! I didn\u2019t plan to put birds or that kind of nature; it\u2019s just me. It\u2019s my culture. I think that it\u2019s more that something had to come.\nGvasalia: And the awareness of it. I think that everyone has been aware of it, for quite a while. Especially in the press. But somehow, suddenly, something is happening. And that makes people speak. So it explodes even more.\nFury: Both of you have talked about working with physical garments as a starting point. Which feels like something very different from perceptions of designers\u2019 working, sketching.\nGvasalia: I don\u2019t remember when I sketched last time.\nMichele: Me either.\nGvasalia: I write in my iPhone ideas now. Because I don\u2019t have a sketchbook with me. I just do notes, reminders. For Monday, when I\u2019m at Balenciaga. A collar like this.\nMichele: It\u2019s true.\nGvasalia: I think with clothing, it\u2019s so three-\u00addimensional, it\u2019s impossible to draw it. For me, I\u2019m always talking about sculpture all the time \u2014 but it is like sculpting. You need to see it in movement also, I hate working on a stock man. I prefer to have a real person, so she moves. Can she actually move in it? Can she drive? This practicality as well. But how it behaves when it\u2019s on, the motion, etc. I always start with a garment, and then I cut. I destroy so many clothes. To make more clothes.\nFury: I guess why you don\u2019t work with a stylist is an interesting question, as it\u2019s another thing that makes you stand out compared to other designers. Alessandro, you never have?\nMichele: I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s like asking, \u201cWhy you don\u2019t drink?\u201d Because I don\u2019t need it. It\u2019s because it\u2019s a process. I don\u2019t have a person that is so close to me to share so much. It\u2019s not because I don\u2019t want it or I\u2019m against the idea of a stylist. It\u2019s just my story. I didn\u2019t use [a stylist] because I love to do the styling of the show. The styling, for me, is the show. It\u2019s the collection. It\u2019s the idea \u2014 what I want to show you about my idea. So it\u2019s impossible to translate to another person. If I need a color, if I need to put something on you, in a different way. I have it in my mind. It\u2019s a vision. Who can have the same vision as me? I\u2019d love to find someone that can share with me. Because sharing is something beautiful. I love to share. But I think that I\u2019m quite obsessed with the styling. I start from both \u2014 the dress and the styling. I don\u2019t have before the dress, and after I style. I think of both together.\nGvasalia: I think styling \u2014 the stylist coming in, saying, \u201cOK, this girl\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s not for now, anymore.\nMichele: Also it\u2019s your job! In a way! It\u2019s completely my vision.\nGvasalia: When I work with Lotta [Volkova, the stylist of Vetements and Balenciaga] \u2014 she knows what I know, what I want. It\u2019s that kind of exchange again. We\u2019re very close, we really know each other, we\u2019re friends. It\u2019s not like I hired her.\nMichele: It\u2019s not a stylist \u2014 she\u2019s a friend of yours.\nGvasalia: And I like how she wears some stuff. I kind of project, because I would love to wear boots to here!\nMichele: This is completely different. It\u2019s your life. This is not a stylist. This is what I was saying before, the idea of sharing something that belongs to us. If I\u2019m inspired by a friend of mine \u2014 could be, yes. This is different. It\u2019s not styling, it\u2019s creating something new, with an energy.\nGvasalia: For me, it\u2019s more sharing of this \u2014 I actually get inspired by seeing. It\u2019s not just \u00adLotta, there are also other women around me that I ... not get inspired by, but I love the way they pull their skirt up. These elements that I\u2019m not doing myself, because I\u2019m a guy, but that gives me an idea.\nFury: You touched on it then \u2014 that idea of gender blurring, which is so relevant to both your work.\nGvasalia: \u201cGender fluidity.\u201d\nFury: I hate that term!\nGvasalia: It\u2019s the worst thing ever. It sounds vulgar.\nMichele: But it\u2019s something that is \u2014 I always say that I didn\u2019t invent anything. It\u2019s something that exists, it\u2019s our life. What can I say? It\u2019s the world. It\u2019s something that exists, I can\u2019t ignore. I understand that for a long time fashion wanted to stay inside fashion. Something like another world. Fashion is, I don\u2019t know where \u2014 in the front of the window in Rue Faubourg? I don\u2019t know. Where is \u201cfashion\u201d? Fashion is the way you dress, the way you are. Again, your attitude. So this word, gender fluidity, is kind of an invention. Because it\u2019s our life. We, all of us, are this way. Fashion is \u2014 if we want to talk about the way you look \u2014 you have, inside, all these different meanings.\nGvasalia: But it\u2019s so there, it\u2019s so normal. On Thursday the [Vetements] show finished with two identical looks: One was on a guy and one was on a girl. We didn\u2019t really think \u2014 oh let\u2019s show that both of them can wear it. We just tried them and both worked and were incredible.\nMichele: It\u2019s not a trick.\nGvasalia: No, not at all. And the guy, he loved it. And she did. I mean, it\u2019s going to be harder for today\u2019s [Balenciaga] show! It\u2019s something that is just ... normal now. Ten, 15 years ago, it wasn\u2019t something that was really happening. It would be a statement, like a conscious statement, to put a dress on a guy. Now it\u2019s just society. You want to wear a dress?\nMichele: We are really in a playground \u2014 it\u2019s nothing predictable. It\u2019s really alive. You think about people. You think again to what is happening outside. I mean, I didn\u2019t create a pair of shoes because I wanted some editorials. Never. I think of a guy in the club, outside in the street, or a friend of mine. It\u2019s a very pragmatic way to see fashion. \u201cFashion.\u201d The word \u201cfashion,\u201d it\u2019s very ...\nGvasalia: It\u2019s tricky. It needs to change!\nMichele: Because fashion is clothes. Sometimes when people talk about me in fashion, I feel \u2014 I don\u2019t want to say uncomfortable, but I still don\u2019t believe that I\u2019m in \u201cfashion.\u201d\nGvasalia: And some people who are not in the fashion industry, when I say I work in fashion, I feel ... [He shrugs, visibly uncomfortable with the word, and frowns.] Do I really have to say it?\nFury: It\u2019s such a loaded thing. It\u2019s loaded with perceptions, from the outside world. That kind of elitism.\nGvasalia: Which is not necessarily true.\nFury: But it\u2019s like you said, Alessandro \u2014 fashion being something in a window. You don\u2019t wear fashion, you wear clothes.\nMichele: I\u2019m seducing me also. I\u2019m seducing myself. Because I was bored, in a way.\nFury: With fashion?\nMichele: I can say I was a fashion person, completely bored. And I wanted to seduce myself. Because I know very well that I need to be seduced. I am doing a lot of things because I feel like a customer. I\u2019m not feeling like a special person; I\u2019m wearing what I\u2019m doing. And I do things that I love. It\u2019s about us. It\u2019s not about me.", "date": "April 11, 2016", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/11/t-magazine/gucci-alessandro-michele-balenciaga-vetements-demna-gvasalia.html", "tags": "like think changing something fashion \u201d michele two guys gvasalia \u2014"}
