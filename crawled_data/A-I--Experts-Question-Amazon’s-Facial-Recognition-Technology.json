Experts Question Amazon\u2019s Facial-Recognition Technology", "content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 At least 25 prominent artificial-intelligence researchers, including experts at Google, Facebook, Microsoft and a recent winner of the prestigious Turing Award, have signed a letter calling on Amazon to stop selling its facial-recognition technology to law enforcement agencies because it is biased against women and people of color.\nThe letter, which was publicly released Wednesday, reflects growing concern in academia and the tech industry that bias in facial-recognition technology is a systemic problem. Some researchers \u2014 and even some companies \u2014 are arguing the technology cannot be properly controlled without government regulation.\nAmazon sells a product called Rekognition through its cloud-computing division, Amazon Web Services. The company said last year that early customers included the Orlando Police Department in Florida and the Washington County Sheriff\u2019s Office in Oregon.\nIn January, two researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology published a peer-reviewed study showing that Amazon Rekognition had more trouble identifying the gender of female and darker-skinned faces in photos than similar services from IBM and Microsoft. It mistook women for men 19 percent of the time, the study showed, and misidentified darker-skinned women for men 31 percent of the time.\nBefore publishing their findings on Amazon Rekognition, the M.I.T. researchers released a similar study examining services from IBM, Microsoft and Megvii, an artificial-intelligence company in China. All three updated their services to address concerns raised by the researchers.\nIn separate blog posts from the Amazon executives Matthew Wood and Michael Punke, the company disputed the study and a Jan. 24 article in The New York Times describing it.\n\u201cThe answer to anxieties over new technology is not to run \u2018tests\u2019 inconsistent with how the service is designed to be used, and to amplify the test\u2019s false and misleading conclusions through the news media,\u201d Dr. Wood wrote. Amazon did not directly engage with the M.I.T. researchers.\nThe letter released on Wednesday was signed by the Google researchers Margaret Mitchell, Andrea Frome and Timnit Gebru; the Facebook researcher Georgia Gkioxari; William Isaac, a researcher at DeepMind, the London lab owned by Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet; and Yoshua Bengio, one of the world\u2019s most important A.I. researchers.\nLast week, Dr. Bengio was one of three people to receive the Turing Award \u2014 often called \u201cthe Nobel Prize of computing\u201d \u2014 for his work with neural networks, the technology that underpins modern facial recognition services.\n\u201cThere are no laws or required standards to ensure that Rekognition is used in a manner that does not infringe on civil liberties,\u201d the A.I. researchers wrote. \u201cWe call on Amazon to stop selling Rekognition to law enforcement.\u201d\nThe researchers added that Dr. Wood and Mr. Punke had \u201cmisrepresented the technical details\u201d of the M.I.T. study and modern facial-recognition technology. Amazon declined to comment on the letter on Wednesday.\nA day after this article was published, an Amazon spokeswoman responded, saying that the company had updated its Rekognition service since the M.I.T. researchers completed their study and that it had found no differences in error rates by gender and race when running similar tests.\nMicrosoft, by contrast, improved the accuracy of its facial recognition last year after an earlier M.I.T. study reported that its system was better at identifying the gender of lighter-skinned men in a photo database than darker-skinned women.\nDuring a February talk at the Cornell Tech graduate school in New York, Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president and chief legal officer, said the company had \u201cparticipated in the market for law enforcement in the United States,\u201d but had also turned down sales when there was concern it could unreasonably infringe on people\u2019s rights.\nIn February, Microsoft backed a bill in Washington State that would require notices to be posted in public places using facial-recognition tech and ensure that government agencies obtain a court order when looking for specific people. The bill is still pending. But the company did not back other legislation that provides much stronger protections.\nMr. Punke wrote in his February blog post that Amazon also supported regulation of facial-recognition technology and called for law enforcement agencies to \u201cbe transparent in how they use facial-recognition technology.\u201d But Amazon has declined to disclose how police or intelligence agencies are using its Rekognition system and whether the company puts any restrictions on its use.\nAmazon has said that it has not received any reports of Rekognition misuse by law enforcement, and that the company\u2019s acceptable use policy prohibits customers from using its services in ways that violate laws.", "date": "April 3, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/03/technology/amazon-facial-recognition-technology.html", "tags": "company technology amazon study microsoft \u201d experts rekognition researchers a.i facial-recognition question"}
