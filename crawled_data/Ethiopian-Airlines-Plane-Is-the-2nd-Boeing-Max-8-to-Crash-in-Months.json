The pilot sent out a distress call and was cleared to return to the airport, Bole International, the airline\u2019s chief executive told reporters.\n[Follow our live briefing here.]\nBut the plane \u2014 the same Boeing model that went down in Indonesia in October, killing all 189 people on board \u2014 lost contact with air traffic controllers six minutes after takeoff. It then plummeted to the ground near Bishoftu, a town southeast of the capital.\n\u201cAt this stage, we cannot rule out anything,\u201d said Tewolde GebreMariam, the chief executive of Ethiopian Airlines, which has a solid reputation for safety among aviation experts and is in the midst of a major expansion as part of its effort to make air travel easier across Africa.\nImages from the vast, smoky crater at the crash site revealed a grim tableau. Workers loaded black body bags into a truck, while plane fragments and various items from the flight \u2014 cigarettes, shoes, napkins with the Ethiopian Airlines logo \u2014 were strewn across the field.\nFlight 302 \u2014 a two-hour shuttle between two of the busiest capitals in East Africa \u2014 was carrying passengers from at least four continents. The dead included 32 Kenyans, 18 Canadians, nine Ethiopians, eight each from the United States, China and Italy, and seven from Britain, the airline said. The French Foreign Ministry said nine of its citizens were aboard.\nThe passengers also reportedly included delegates traveling to Nairobi for a weeklong United Nations Environment Assembly that was scheduled to start on Monday.\n[Read more about who the victims were and where they were from.]\nWhile the cause of the crash was unclear, the disaster is certain to raise more doubts about the safety of the 737 Max 8, one of Boeing\u2019s fastest-selling airplanes.\nThe plane, delivered to Ethiopian Airlines in November, was new, just like the Lion Air airplane that plunged nose down into the Java Sea last October, minutes after taking off from Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.\nFlight 302 took off in good weather, but its vertical speed became unstable right after takeoff, fluctuating wildly, according to data published by FlightRadar24 on Twitter. In the first three minutes of flight, the vertical speed varied from zero feet per minute per hour to 1,472 to minus 1,920 \u2014 unusual during ascent.\n\u201cDuring takeoff, one would expect sustained positive vertical speed indications,\u201d Ian Petchenik, a spokesman for FlightRadar24, said in an email on Sunday.\nCrashes involving new planes in good weather are rare.\nThe Lion Air accident also involved a plane that crashed minutes after takeoff and after the crew requested permission to return to the airport. The Lion Air pilots struggled to keep the plane ascending, with the jet\u2019s nose forced dangerously downward over two dozen times during the 11-minute flight.\nThe National Transportation Safety Board in the United States said it would send a four-person team to assist Ethiopian authorities investigating Sunday\u2019s crash. The Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement, \u201cWe are in contact with the State Department and plan to join the N.T.S.B. in its assistance with Ethiopian civil aviation authorities to investigate the crash.\u201d\nBoeing said in a statement on Twitter that a technical team was ready to provide assistance at the request of the safety board.\nIn the Lion Air crash, officials are investigating whether changes to the Max 8\u2019s automatic controls might have sent that flight into an unrecoverable nose dive.\nAn investigation by Indonesian authorities determined that the Lion Air plane\u2019s abrupt nose\u2010dive may have been caused by updated Boeing software that is meant to prevent a stall but that can send the plane into a fatal descent if the altitude and angle information being fed into the computer system is incorrect.\nThe change in the flight control system, which can override manual actions taken in the Max model, was not explained to pilots, according to some pilots\u2019 unions.\nGlobal alerts were sent to notify pilots flying the Max about how to counter the anti\u2010stall system.\nFamilies of some of the victims of the Lion Air crash are suing Boeing, arguing that the company failed to properly inform pilots of the updated software.\n[Read about the questions faced by Boeing after the second crash of a Boeing 737 Max 8.] ]\nLynette Dray, an aviation expert and senior research associate at University College London, said that the Max model has a more efficient engine than the previous 737 aircraft, but that \u201cit\u2019s not revolutionary new.\u201d\nBoeing has delivered more than 350 Max 8 models to airlines around the world, including in the United States, Canada and Europe. The planes entered service in 2017, generally replacing older 737\u2019s.\nWhile both of the Max 8 planes that crashed experienced similar dips and climbs during their ascents, the airlines flying them have notably different reputations. Even before the October crash, Lion Air had a notorious safety record.\nEthiopian Airlines, Africa\u2019s biggest carrier, is widely considered its best and has expanded rapidly in recent years, opening new routes all over the continent.\nThe airline has ordered 30 of the Max 8 planes and already had five in its fleet, with the first being delivered last year, according to FlightRadar24.\nBoeing had promoted the model by minimizing the costs of upgrading, saying the 737 Max 8 required little additional training for pilots who had flown a previous version of the plane. That is believed to have been a key in winning orders from airlines that had also been considering an updated model, the Airbus A320, from Boeing\u2019s archrival.\nThere has not been a crash involving Ethiopian Airlines since January 2010, when a Boeing 737 crashed into the Mediterranean Sea shortly after it took off from Beirut, Lebanon. None of the 90 people onboard that flight \u2014 82 passengers and eight crew members \u2014 survived.\nEthiopian Airlines said on Sunday that the captain of the flight, Yared Getachew, 29, had more than 8,000 flying hours and a \u201ccommendable performance.\u201d\nThe plane, which underwent a \u201crigorous first check maintenance\u201d on Feb. 4, had flown back to the Ethiopian capital from Johannesburg, South Africa, on Sunday morning, according to the airline.\n\u201cEthiopian Airlines is very, very highly regarded; it\u2019s part of the Star Alliance,\u201d Graham Braithwaite, a professor of safety and accident investigation at Cranfield University in Britain, said by phone on Sunday.\nProfessor Braithwaite was referring to the airline alliance that includes carriers like Lufthansa, Singapore Airlines and United.\nThe lead investigation will start in the country where the crash happened, Ethiopia, he said, but other countries will also be involved \u2014 Kenya and the United States, independently of Boeing, because the aircraft was made in the United States.\n\u201cThey\u2019ll want to work quite swiftly,\u201d Professor Braithwaite said. \u201cIt\u2019s in nobody\u2019s interest that a failure goes unknown.\u201d\nThe priority will be to make sure there is no link between the crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia, and other countries and airlines will no doubt be watching closely, given the plane\u2019s global popularity.\nAt Nairobi\u2019s Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, distraught family members and friends gathered at an emergency center established by the authorities. Another emergency center was set up at a nearby hotel within the airport to provide counseling.\n\u201cI came to the airport to receive my brother but I have been told there is a problem,\u201d one family member, Agnes Muilu, told The Associated Press. \u201cI just pray that he is safe, or he was not on it.\u201d\nFlight 302 was popular with aid workers based in Ethiopia who needed to exit and re-enter the country regularly so as not to violate work permits.\nThe executive director of the World Food Program, a United Nations organization, said on Twitter that staff members from the group were among the dead. Aid workers from the United Nations, Catholic Relief Services and other organizations were also aboard the plane.\nEthiopia, with about 100 million people, is the second\u2010most populous nation in Africa. Since elections in March, the new prime minister has been embarking on a series of political reforms, chiefly to officially end two decades of hostilities with Eritrea, a neighboring country and longtime rival.\nThe country\u2019s flagship carrier has undergone a major expansion, more than doubling its staff to 11,000 employees in the past decade, with the goal of easing air travel in a part of the world where flying is notoriously complicated.\nIt added nonstop flights, for instance, from Newark to Lom\u00e9, Togo, a hub for the airline, that then continue on to Addis Ababa.\nIn Africa, Ethiopian has a reputation for having a newer fleet than other airlines, for operating flights that are mostly on time and for having accommodating schedules.\nProfessor Braithwaite described Ethiopian Airways as \u201cone of the best operators in Africa.\u201d", "date": "March 10, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/10/world/africa/ethiopian-airlines-plane-crash.html", "tags": "crash airlines boeing plane \u201d months flight \u2014 ethiopian max"}
