{"title": "Here Are 13 Examples Of Donald Trump Being Racist", "content": "Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump may have failed to disavow the Ku Klux Klan\u00a0in late February, but he\u2019ll have you know he is not racist. In fact, he claims to be \u201cthe least racist person that you have ever met,\u201d and last summer he pulled out the old standby about not having a racist bone in his body.\nBut he hasn\u2019t given us a lot of reason to believe that. In fact, despite Trump\u2019s protests to the contrary, he has a long history of saying and doing racist things. It\u2019s not really surprising that he\u2019s won the support and praise of the country\u2019s white supremacists.\nHere\u2019s a running list of some of the most glaringly racist things associated with Trump. We\u2019re sure we\u2019ll be adding to it soon.\nTrump\u2019s retaliation against the parents of a Muslim U.S. Army officer who died while serving in the Iraq War was a clear low point in a campaign full of hateful rhetoric.\nKhizr Khan, the father of the late Army Captain Humayun Khan, spoke out against Trump\u2019s bigoted rhetoric and disregard for civil liberties at the Democratic National Convention on July 28. It quickly became the most memorable moment of the convention.\n\u201cLet me ask you, have you even read the U.S. Constitution?\u201d Khan asked Trump before pulling a copy of the document from his jacket pocket and holding it up. \u201cI will gladly lend you my copy,\u201d he declared.\nKhan\u2019s wife Ghazala Khan, who wears a Muslim head scarf, stood at his side during the speech but did not speak.\nIn response to the devastating speech, Trump seized on Ghazala Khan\u2019s silence to insinuate that she was forbidden from speaking due to the couple\u2019s Islamic faith.\n\u201cIf you look at his wife, she was standing there. She had nothing to say. She probably, maybe she wasn\u2019t allowed to have anything to say. You tell me,\u201d Trump said in an interview with ABC News that first appeared on July 30.\nGhazala Khan explained in an op-ed in the Washington Post the following day that she could not speak because of grief over her son.\n\u201cWalking onto the convention stage, with a huge picture of my son behind me, I could hardly control myself. What mother could?\u201d she wrote. \u201cDonald Trump has children whom he loves. Does he really need to wonder why I did not speak?\u201d\nIn May, Trump implied that Gonzalo Curiel, the federal judge presiding over a class action against the for-profit Trump University, could not fairly hear the case because of his Mexican heritage.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a Mexican,\u201d Trump told CNN of Curiel. \u201cWe\u2019re building a wall between here and Mexico. The answer is, he is giving us very unfair rulings \u2014 rulings that people can\u2019t even believe.\u201d\nCuriel, it should be noted, is an American citizen who was born in Indiana. And as a prosecutor in the late 1990s, he went after Mexican drug cartels, making him a target for assassination by a Tijuana drug lord.\nEven members of Trump\u2019s own party slammed the racist remarks.\n\u201cClaiming a person can\u2019t do their job because of their race is sort of like the textbook definition of a racist comment,\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said in a reaction to Trump\u2019s comments, though he clarified that he still endorses the nominee.\nThe comments against Curiel didn\u2019t sit well with the American public either. According to a YouGov poll released in June, 51 percent of those surveyed agreed that Trump\u2019s comments were not only wrong, but also racist.Fifty-seven percent of Americans think Trump was wrong to complain against the judge, while just 20 percent think he was right to do so.\nWhen asked whether he would trust a Muslim judge, in light of his proposed restrictions on Muslim immigration, Trump suggested that such a judge might not be fair to him either.\nWhen Trump was serving as the president of his family\u2019s real estate company, the Trump Management Corporation, in 1973, the Justice Department sued the company for alleged racial discrimination against black people looking to rent apartments in Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island.\nThe lawsuit charged that the company quoted different rental terms and conditions to black rental candidates than it did with white candidates, and that the company lied to black applicants about apartments not being available. Trump called those accusations \u201cabsolutely ridiculous\u201d and sued the Justice Department for $100 million in damages for defamation.\nWithout admitting wrongdoing, the Trump Management Corporation settled the original lawsuit two years later and promised not to discriminate against black people, Puerto Ricans or other minorities. Trump also agreed to send weekly vacancy lists for his 15,000 apartments to the New York Urban League, a civil rights group,\u00a0and to allow the NYUL to present qualified applicants for vacancies in certain Trump properties.\nJust three years after that, the Justice Department sued the Trump Management Corporation again for allegedly discriminating against black applicants by telling them apartments weren\u2019t available.\nWorkers at Trump\u2019s casinos in Atlantic City, New Jersey, have accused him of racism over the years. The New Jersey Casino Control Commission fined the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino\u00a0$200,000 in 1992 because managers would remove African-American card dealers at the request of a certain big-spending gambler. A state appeals court upheld the fine.\nThe first-person account of at least one black Trump casino employee in Atlantic City suggests the racist practices were consistent with Trump\u2019s personal behavior toward black workers.\n\u201cWhen Donald and Ivana came to the casino, the bosses would order all the black people off the floor,\u201d Kip Brown, a former employee at Trump\u2019s Castle, told the New Yorker for a September article. \u201cIt was the eighties, I was a teen-ager, but I remember it: they put us all in the back.\u201d\nTrump disparaged his black casino employees as \u201clazy\u201d in vividly bigoted terms, according to a 1991 book by John O\u2019Donnell, a former president of Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino.\n\u201cAnd isn\u2019t it funny. I\u2019ve got black accountants at Trump Castle and Trump Plaza. Black guys counting my money! I hate it,\u201d O\u2019Donnell recalled Trump saying. \u201cThe only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day.\u201d\n\u201cI think the guy is lazy,\u201d Trump said of a black employee, according to O\u2019Donnell. \u201cAnd it\u2019s probably not his fault because laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is, I believe that. It\u2019s not anything they can control.\u201d\nThree times in a row on Feb. 28, Trump sidestepped opportunities to renounce white nationalist and former KKK leader David Duke, who told his radio audience last week that voting for any candidate other than Trump is \u201creally treason to your heritage.\u201d\nWhen asked by CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper if he would condemn Duke and say he didn\u2019t want a vote from him or any other white supremacists, Trump claimed that he didn\u2019t know anything about white supremacists or about Duke himself. When Tapper pressed him twice more, Trump said he couldn\u2019t condemn a group he hadn\u2019t yet researched.\nBy Feb. 29, Trump was saying\u00a0that in fact he does disavow Duke, and that the only reason he didn\u2019t do so on CNN was because of a \u201clousy earpiece.\u201d Video of the exchange, however, shows Trump responding quickly to Tapper\u2019s questions with no apparent difficulty in hearing.\nIt\u2019s preposterous to think that Trump doesn\u2019t know about white supremacist groups or their sometimes violent support of him. Reports of neo-Nazi groups rallying around Trump\u00a0go back as far as August.\nHis white supremacist fan club includes the Daily Stormer, a leading neo-Nazi news site; Richard Spencer, director of the National Policy Institute, which aims to promote the \u201cheritage, identity, and future of European people\u201d; Jared Taylor, editor of American Renaissance, a Virginia-based white nationalist magazine; Michael Hill, head of the League of the South, an Alabama-based white supremacist secessionist group; and Brad Griffin, a member of Hill\u2019s League of the South and author of the popular white supremacist blog Hunter Wallace.\nA leader of the Virginia KKK who is backing Trump\u00a0told a local TV reporter earlier this month, \u201cThe reason a lot of Klan members like Donald Trump is because a lot of what he believes, we believe in.\u201d\nAnd most recently, the Trump campaign announced that one of its California primary delegates was William Johnson, chair of the white nationalist American Freedom Party. The Trump campaign subsequently said his inclusion was a mistake, and Johnson withdrew his name at their request.\nLong before calling Mexican immigrants \u201ccriminals\u201d and \u201crapists,\u201d Trump was a leading proponent of \u201cbirtherism,\u201d the racist conspiracy theory that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States and is thus an illegitimate president. Trump claimed in 2011 to have sent people to Hawaii to investigate whether Obama was really born there. He insisted at the time that the researchers \u201ccannot believe what they are finding.\u201d\nObama ultimately got the better of Trump, releasing his long-form birth certificate and relentlessly mocking the real estate mogul about it at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner that year.\nBut Trump continues to insinuate that the president was not born in the country.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where he was born,\u201d Trump said in a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February 2015. (Again, for the record: He was born in Hawaii.)\n\u00a0\nLike many racial instigators, Trump often answers accusations of bigotry by loudly protesting that he actually loves the group in question. But that\u2019s just as uncomfortable to hear, because he\u2019s still treating all the members of the group \u2015 all the individual human beings \u2015 as essentially the same and interchangeable. Language is telling, here:\u00a0Virtually every time Trump mentions a minority group, he uses the definite article the, as in \u201cthe Hispanics,\u201d \u201cthe Muslims\u201d and \u201cthe blacks.\u201d\nIn that sense, Trump\u2019s defensive explanations are of a piece with his slander of minorities. Both rely on essentializing racial and ethnic groups, blurring them into simple, monolithic entities, instead of acknowledging that there\u2019s as much variety among Muslims and Latinos and black people as there is among white people.\nHow did Trump respond to the outrage last year that followed his characterization of Mexican immigrants as criminals and rapists?\n\u201cI\u2019ll take jobs back from China, I\u2019ll take jobs back from Japan,\u201d Trump said during his visit to the U.S.-Mexican border in July. \u201cThe Hispanics are going to get those jobs, and they\u2019re going to love Trump.\u201d\nHow did Trump respond to critics of his proposal to ban Muslims from entering the U.S.?\n\u201cI\u2019m doing good for the Muslims,\u201d Trump told CNN in December. \u201cMany Muslim friends of mine are in agreement with me. They say, \u2018Donald, you brought something up to the fore that is so brilliant and so fantastic.\u2019\u201d\nNot long before he called for a blanket ban on Muslims entering the country, Trump was proclaiming his affection for \u201cthe Muslims,\u201d disagreeing with rival candidate Ben Carson\u2019s claim in September that being a Muslim should disqualify someone from running for president.\n\u201cI love the Muslims. I think they\u2019re great people,\u201d Trump said, insisting that he would be willing to name a Muslim to his presidential cabinet.\nHow did Trump respond to the people who called him out for funding an investigation into whether Obama was born in the United States?\n\u201cI have a great relationship with the blacks,\u201d Trump said in April 2011. \u201cI\u2019ve always had a great relationship with the blacks.\u201d\nEven when Trump has dropped the definite article \u201cthe,\u201d his attempts at praising minority groups he has previously slandered have been offensive.\nLook no further than the infamous Cinco de Mayo taco bowl tweet:\nFormer Republican presidential candidate and Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R) had a good breakdown of everything that was wrong with Trump\u2019s comment.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like eating a watermelon and saying \u2018I love African-Americans,\u2019\u201d Bush quipped.\nIn 1993, when Trump wanted to open a casino in Bridgeport, Connecticut, that would compete with one owned by the Mashantucket Pequot Nation, a local Native American tribe, he told the House subcommittee on Native American Affairs\u00a0that\u00a0\u201cthey don\u2019t look like Indians to me... They don\u2019t look like Indians to Indians.\u201d\nTrump then elaborated on those remarks, which were unearthed last year in the Hartford Courant,\u00a0by saying the mafia had infiltrated Indian casinos.\u00a0\nIn 1989, Trump took out full-page ads in four New York City-area newspapers calling for the return of the death penalty in New York and the expansion of police authority in response to the infamous case of a woman who was beaten and raped while jogging in Manhattan\u2019s Central Park.\n\u201cThey should be forced to suffer and, when they kill, they should be executed for their crimes,\u201d Trump wrote, referring to the Central Park attackers and other violent criminals. \u201cI want to hate these murderers and I always will.\u201d\nThe public outrage over the Central Park jogger rape, at a time when the city was struggling with high crime, led to the wrongful conviction of five teenagers of color known as the Central Park Five.\nThe men\u2019s convictions were overturned in 2002, after they\u2019d already spent\u00a0years in prison,\u00a0when DNA evidence showed they did not commit the crime. Today, their case is considered a cautionary tale about a politicized criminal justice process.\nTrump, however, still thinks the men are guilty.\nAt a November campaign rally in Alabama, Trump supporters physically attacked an African-American protester after the man began chanting \u201cBlack lives matter.\u201d Video of the incident shows the assailants kicking the man after he has already fallen to the ground.\nThe following day, Trump implied that the attackers were justified.\n\u201cMaybe [the protester]\u00a0should have been roughed up,\u201d he mused. \u201cIt was absolutely disgusting what he was doing.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s dismissive attitude toward the protester is part of a larger, troubling pattern of instigating violence toward protesters at campaign events that has singled out people of color.\nOne reason Trump may have exhibited special disdain for that particular demonstrator in November, however, is because he believes the entire Black Lives Matter movement lacks legitimate policy grievances. He alluded to these views in an interview with the New York Times magazine this week when he described Ferguson, Missouri, as one of the most dangerous places in America. The small St. Louis suburb is not even in the top 20 highest-crime municipalities in the country.\nTrump\u2019s racial incitement has already inspired hate crimes. Two brothers arrested in Boston last summer for beating up a homeless Latino man cited Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant message when explaining why they did it. \u00a0\n\u201cDonald Trump was right \u2015 all these illegals need to be deported,\u201d one of the men reportedly told police officers.\nTrump did not even bother to distance himself from them. Instead, he suggested that the men were well-intentioned and had simply gotten carried away.\n\u201cI will say that people who are following me are very passionate,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey love this country and they want this country to be great again. They are passionate.\u201d\nWhen Trump addressed the Republican Jewish Coalition in December, he tried to relate to the crowd by invoking the stereotype of Jews as talented and cunning businesspeople.\n\u201cI\u2019m a negotiator, like you folks,\u201d Trump told the crowd, touting his book The Art of the Deal.\n\u201cIs there anyone who doesn\u2019t renegotiate deals in this room?\u201d Trump said. \u201cPerhaps more than any room I\u2019ve spoken to.\u201d\nBut that wasn\u2019t even the most offensive thing Trump told his Jewish audience. He implied that he had little chance of earning the Jewish Republican group\u2019s support, because his fealty could not be bought with campaign donations.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to support me, because I don\u2019t want your money,\u201d he said. \u201cYou want to control your own politician.\u201d\nIronically, Trump has many close Jewish family members. His daughter Ivanka converted to Judaism in 2009 before marrying the real estate mogul Jared Kushner. Trump and Kushner raise their two children in an observant Jewish home.\nThen in July, Trump tweeted an anti-Semitic Hillary Clinton meme that featured a photo of her over a backdrop of $100 bills with a six-pointed Jewish Star of David next to her face.\n\u201cCrooked Hillary - - Makes History!\u201d he wrote in the tweet, which also read \u201cMost Corrupt Candidate Ever\u201d over the star.\nThe holy symbol was co-opted by the Nazis during World War II when they forced Jews to sew it onto their clothing. Using the symbol over a pile of money is blatantly anti-Semitic and re-enforces hateful stereotypes of Jewish greed.\nBut Trump insisted the image was harmless.\n\u201cThe sheriff\u2019s badge \u2015\u00a0which is available under Microsoft\u2019s \u2018shapes\u2019 \u2015\u00a0fit with the theme of corrupt Hillary and that is why I selected it,\u201d he said in a statement.\nMic, however, discovered that the the meme was actually created by white supremacists and could be found on a neo-Nazi forum more than a week before Trump shared it. Additionally, a watermark on the image leads to a Twitter account that regularly tweets racist, sexist political memes.\nAt a campaign appearance in California in June, Trump boasted that he had a black supporter in the crowd, saying \u201clook at my African American over here.\u201d\n\u201cLook at him,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cAre you the greatest?\u201d\nTrump went on to imply that the media \u00a0conceals his appeal among African Americans by not covering the crowd more attentively.\n\u201cWe have tremendous African-American support,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reason is I\u2019m going to bring jobs back to our country.\u201d\nIn fact, Trump has the lowest level of African-American support of any Republican presidential nominee since 1948, according to FiveThirtyEight. As of the most recent polling, just 2 percent of black voters plan to vote for him \u2015 fewer than the percentage who plan to vote for Green Party candidate Jill Stein or Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson.\nIt may not be surprising that Trump has brought so much racial animus into the 2016 election cycle, given his family history. His father, Fred Trump, was the target of folk singer Woody Guthrie\u2019s lyrics after Guthrie lived for two years in a building owned by Trump pere: \u201cI suppose / Old Man Trump knows / Just how much / Racial hate / He stirred up / In the bloodpot of human hearts.\u201d\nAnd last fall, a news report from 1927 surfaced on the site Boing Boing, revealing that Fred Trump was arrested\u00a0that year following a KKK riot in Queens. It\u2019s not clear exactly what the elder Trump was doing there or what role he may have played in the riot. Donald Trump, for his part,\u00a0has categorically denied (except when he\u2019s ambiguously denied) that anything of the sort ever happened.\nEditor\u2019s note: Donald Trump is a\u00a0serial liar,\u00a0rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist,\u00a0birther\u00a0and\u00a0bully\u00a0who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims \u2015 1.6 billion members of an entire religion \u2015 from entering the U.S.", "date": "\n02/29/2016", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-racist-examples_n_56d47177e4b03260bf777e83", "tags": "people \u201c white trump examples racist donald told black"}
