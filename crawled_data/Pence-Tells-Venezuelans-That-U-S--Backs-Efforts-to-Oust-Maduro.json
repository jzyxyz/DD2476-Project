{"title": "Pence Tells Venezuelans That U.S. Backs Efforts to Oust Maduro", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Vice President Mike Pence on Tuesday declared the United States\u2019 \u201cunwavering support\u201d for planned mass protests in Venezuela against President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, the most explicit backing yet by the Trump administration as opposition leaders try to unseat Mr. Maduro.\nThe declaration, the first in which Mr. Pence used a video to directly urge Venezuelans to take action, came after months of statements by senior Trump administration officials, including several strongly worded ones from the vice president, that said Mr. Maduro\u2019s rule was illegitimate.\n\u201cWe are with you,\u201d Mr. Pence wrote on Twitter on Tuesday in both Spanish and English, adding, \u201cWe stand with you, and we will stay with you until Democracy is restored and you reclaim your birthright of Libertad.\u201d\nThe post, which came as Venezuelan opposition leaders were calling for citizens to take to the streets on Wednesday, was accompanied by a video in which Mr. Pence said he and President Trump were united with them in their \u201ccall for freedom.\u201d\n\u201cNicol\u00e1s Maduro is a dictator with no legitimate claim to power,\u201d Mr. Pence said. \u201cHe\u2019s never won the presidency in a free and fair election, and he\u2019s maintained his grip on power by imprisoning anyone who dares to oppose him.\u201d\nMr. Maduro fired back hours later, saying that he had ordered \u201ca total and absolute revision\u201d of Venezuela\u2019s relationship with the United States. Speaking on state television, he asked: \u201cWho elects the president of Venezuela? Mike Pence?\u201d\nThe call for mass street protests against Mr. Maduro originated with the head of the National Assembly, Juan Guaid\u00f3, an opposition leader. Mr. Guaid\u00f3 was sworn in to office on Jan. 5 and soon invoked an article of Venezuela\u2019s Constitution that transfers power to the leader of the National Assembly, the nation\u2019s legislative body, in the event that the presidency becomes vacant. The assembly has declared Mr. Maduro\u2019s re-election last year illegitimate and called for new elections.\nOn Jan. 15, Mr. Pence spoke with Mr. Guaid\u00f3 by telephone to express the \u201cUnited States\u2019 resolute support for the National Assembly of Venezuela as the only legitimate democratic body in the country.\u201d\nJohn D. Feeley, a former diplomat to Latin American nations who is now a consultant to the television network Univision, said that while \u201cthe vice president\u2019s tweet stopped short of formal recognition of Guaid\u00f3 as interim president,\u201d the statement was \u201ca nudge to Guaid\u00f3 to keep pushing on an open door.\u201d\nMembers of Congress from Florida met with Mr. Trump on Tuesday and discussed Latin America policy, including on Venezuela.\n\u201cWe encouraged the president today to follow through with what he\u2019s already declared, which is that Maduro is illegitimate,\u201d said Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican. \u201cThe next logical step is to recognize the president of the National Assembly as the rightful president.\u201d\nMr. Trump and other top American officials, including Mr. Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, have consistently used harsh terms to criticize Mr. Maduro, a leftist politician who has exercised authoritarian powers and guided his country into an economic collapse that has led millions of Venezuelans to leave for neighboring countries.\nThe New York Times reported in September that the Trump administration held secret meetings with rebellious Venezuelan military officials to discuss overthrowing Mr. Maduro, though American officials eventually decided not to help the plotters.\n\u201cAll options are on the table,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters in late September at the United Nations General Assembly meeting. \u201cEvery one. The strong ones, and the less-than-strong ones. Every option \u2014 and you know what I mean by strong.\u201d\nMr. Maduro made a surprise visit to the General Assembly and railed against the United States in a 50-minute speech, calling Americans \u201cimperialists.\u201d He and Mr. Trump did not meet.\nBeforehand, Mr. Trump had said that he was willing to meet with Mr. Maduro if the opportunity presented itself. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take care of Venezuela,\u201d he said.\nMany citizens of Latin America recall a long history of the United States\u2019 supporting coups in the region by right-wing military leaders who then quashed democratic processes and rule of law to maintain power for years and sometimes decades.\nIn November, Mark Green, the head of the United States Agency for International Development, said in an interview that his agency was trying to provide help for the millions of refugees who have fled the economic collapse in Venezuela.\nThe United States announced several times last year that it was giving millions of dollars in aid to the country\u2019s neighbors, notably Colombia, to help the refugees. At least $96 million intended mainly for food and health aid has been dedicated to the effort. Some observers have argued that the United States should be providing more aid.", "date": "Jan. 22, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/22/world/americas/venezuela-usa-nicolas-maduro.html", "tags": "tells efforts \u201c maduro venezuela oust venezuelans u.s. united pence states trump backs"}
