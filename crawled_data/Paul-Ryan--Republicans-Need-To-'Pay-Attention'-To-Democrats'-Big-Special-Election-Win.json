{"title": "Paul Ryan- Republicans Need To 'Pay Attention' To Democrats' Big Special Election Win", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2015 Wisconsin Democrats scored a major upset victory Tuesday when they won a state Senate race in a district that Donald Trump easily carried in the 2016 presidential election.\u00a0\nTop Wisconsin Republicans \u2015 including House Speaker Paul Ryan \u2015 acknowledged it was a blow to their party, and it could mean bad news for the GOP in the 2018 midterm elections.\u00a0\n\u201cI know this district fairly well. It\u2019s not my district. It\u2019s over in western Wisconsin. But typically, we\u2019ve held this seat. And we lost this seat last night,\u201d Ryan told reporters in Washington on Wednesday. \u201cSo yeah, I think we should pay attention to it.\u201d\nGOP Gov. Scott Walker, who is up for re-election in Wisconsin this year, called it a \u201cwake-up call.\u201d\nDemocrat Patty Schachtner, a county medical examiner, defeated her Republican opponent in state Senate District 10. Walker called a special election for the seat after the incumbent, Republican Sheila Harsdorf, gave it up to become his agriculture secretary.\nHarsdorf first won the seat in 2000, and the district has been solidly Republican.\u00a0In 2016, Harsdorf won re-election by\u00a026 percentage points, and Trump beat Democratic rival\u00a0Hillary Clinton\u00a0by 17 points. Republican presidential candidate\u00a0Mitt Romney\u00a0carried the district in 2012.\u00a0\nTuesday\u2019s win was the latest in a series of victories for Democrats since Trump\u2019s inauguration. The party has flipped 34 state legislative seats nationwide, compared with just four pick-ups for the GOP. Democrats last year also recaptured the governor\u2019s mansion in New Jersey and \u2015 in 2017\u2032s highest-profile race \u2015 gained\u00a0a U.S. Senate seat\u00a0in Alabama.", "date": "\n01/17/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/paul-ryan-pay-attention_n_5a5f78e4e4b096ecfca9b0eb", "tags": "need election democrats win gop paul wisconsin seat \u2015 ryan- republican senate district republicans state attention special big"}
