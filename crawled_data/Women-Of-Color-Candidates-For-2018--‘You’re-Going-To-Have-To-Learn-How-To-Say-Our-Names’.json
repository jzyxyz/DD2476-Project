I love these names!\u201d Tlaib said as a roomful of women cheered, referring to congressional candidates \u2015 and likely history makers \u2015 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York, Ilhan Omar in Minnesota and Ayanna Pressley in Massachusetts. \n\u201cYes, you\u2019re going to have to learn how to say our names,\u201d Tlaib said, to laughs and applause. \nWith the primaries for the midterm elections now over, 2018 promises to be\u00a0a historic year for representation in political office.\u00a0More women won\u00a0House and Senate primaries this year than ever before. Christine Hallquist in Vermont could be the nation\u2019s\u00a0first openly transgender governor. And a number of women of color candidates, if they prevail in November, are set to shake up the makeup of the country\u2019s overwhelmingly white and male governors and members of Congress. Stacey Abrams in Georgia, for instance, could become the\u00a0first black female governor\u00a0in the U.S.\u00a0\nSpeakers at the summit emphasized the need for people to turn out to vote and back female candidates of color \u2015 and for more women of color to run for office.\n\u201cLook at this room. Isn\u2019t it amazing? Amazing women leaders are what we need to push us forward,\u201d Haaland said. She mentioned her background as a single mother who worked minimum wage jobs and used food stamps while raising her \u201cbeautiful queer daughter.\u201d\u00a0\u201cWe need more people [in office] who understand struggle and know what it means to be fierce in the face of difficulty.\u201d\u00a0\nSummit founder Aimee Allison started off the day by listing statistics on how women of color have consistently led as voters and organizers, adding that the time had come for them to be represented in elected office. Black women are among the demographic groups with the highest rates of turnout at the polls, she said. And while women of color make up 20 percent of the U.S. population, they account for only about 7 percent of members of Congress.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t even get clean water for our children, because our lens is not at the table,\u201d Tlaib said, recalling her encounters with Michigan families struggling amid the state\u2019s notorious water crisis. \u201cSo you all better run for office.\u201d\nMany speakers noted that their work as progressive women of color in politics led to not only beating Republicans but also unseating centrist establishment Democrats. \n\u201cNot all Democrats are created equal,\u201d as California Assemblywoman Wendy Carrillo put it. Several shouted out Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s victory against a 10-term Democratic incumbent.\n\u201cIf 2018 is not the year the Democratic establishment learns its lesson, it\u2019s the year voters teach it to them,\u201d declared Andrea Mercado, the director of the Florida New Majority, which is working to increase turnout among marginalized groups. In the state\u2019s primaries last month, progressive Andrew Gillum pulled off an upset win, becoming\u00a0Florida\u2019s first black gubernatorial nominee. \nToward the end of the summit\u2019s morning session, legendary workers\u2019 rights organizer Dolores Huerta took the stage and led a chant that had all the women in the room yelling.\n\u201cWho got the power?\u201d \u201cWe got the power!\u201d \n\u201cWhat kind of power?\u201d \u201cFeminist power!\u201d \n\u201c\u00bfSe puede?\u201d \u201c\u00a1S\u00ed se puede!\u201d ", "date": "\n09/20/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/she-the-people-summit-women-of-color-candidates-2018_n_5ba42778e4b0181540db8990", "tags": "\u2018 going candidates office first learn names \u201d \u2015 say year women power color"}
