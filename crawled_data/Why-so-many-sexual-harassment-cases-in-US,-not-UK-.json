{"title": "Why so many sexual harassment cases in US, not UK?", "content": "There are huge differences between UK and US media law - does this explain why more Americans are being accused of sexual harassment?\nOn 5 October, Harvey Weinstein was accused of sexual abuse and the dam broke.\nSince then, dozens of well-known Americans have been accused of sexual misconduct of some kind. This isn't drip-drip. It's a flood.\nThe list includes film stars such as Kevin Spacey, politicians such as Roy Moore, and journalists such as Mark Halperin.\nThe deluge of allegations swelled this week, engulfing big media names.\nWhile people in other countries have also been accused, the majority of cases are American.\nOne reason could be US media law and how it differs from other countries.\nIn the UK, there is a key point in libel law that explains a lot.\nWhen someone sues, they don't have to prove the story is wrong. \nThe publisher - for example, the newspaper or website - has to prove their story is right.\nThis means, before publishing, the media needs a water-tight case. To accuse someone of sexual misconduct, they would normally need proof (such as a recording) or a witness prepared to testify in court.\nIn cases of sexual misconduct, both things are hard to find.\nThere were, for example, rumours of Jimmy Savile's sexual abuse for years. Louis Theroux even asked Savile about them in 2000.\nBut the British media - worried about being sued - didn't publish. It wasn't until Savile died that ITV broke the story (in UK law, a dead person cannot be defamed).\nYou don't even need to name someone to be sued in the UK.\nIn 2012, BBC Newsnight wrongly linked Lord McAlpine to child sex abuse, without naming him. \nHe sued and within 13 days won \u00a3185,000 in damages.\nIn the US, it's far harder to sue for libel. The reason is 226 years old, but as relevant as ever.\nThe first amendment to the US constitution - adopted in 1791 - protects freedom of speech and freedom of the press.\nIt means American media law is \"radically different\" to the UK, says Stuart Karle, a professor at Columbia Journalism School in New York and former general counsel for the Wall Street Journal.\n\"In the US, the burden is on the plaintiff - the person alleging that he or she has been defamed - to prove the statement is false,\" he says.\nSo - compared to the UK - the burden of proof is flipped. Americans are less likely to sue, so US media are more likely to break the story.\nIndeed, a New York Times editorial in May said \"hardly anyone jousts with the (New York) Times when it comes to formally asserting libel\".\nAnd - for celebrities - there's another hurdle to clear when suing in the US.\nWhen a public official (such as a government employee) or public figure (such as a celebrity) sues for libel, they must prove \"actual malice\".\n\"Actual malice basically means the journalist lied,\" says Professor Karle.\n\"Either the journalist published a story they knew was false - or they acted with reckless disregard over whether it was true or false.\n\"That basically means - you lied.\"\nBut - despite the bar being higher - it doesn't mean American media has carte blanche. And, when they do get it wrong, it can cost millions of dollars.\nIn 2014, Rolling Stone magazine covered an alleged gang rape at the University of Virginia in 2012. \nThe story was retracted in 2015 and a university official - who handled sexual assault cases - sued for defamation. She was awarded $3m in damages.\nFurther back, a prosecutor sued the Philadelphia Inquirer over articles published in 1973. He won $34m.\n\"Sometimes you hear 'in the United States, reputation isn't valued',\" says Professor Karle.\n\"But the US laws are highly protective of reputation. The damages can be massive - far, far greater than one could get in the UK.\n\"So you have more (defamation) cases in the UK and more stories that aren't published or broadcast.\n\"But in the US, if a plaintiff wins, the potential damages are in the millions - or tens of millions.\"\nFor this reason - and for reasons of good journalism - American media often goes to great lengths to verify accusations.\nIn their recent story about television presenter Charlie Rose, the Washington Post spoke to eight women - three of them on the record.\nIn breaking the story about comedian Louis CK, the New York Times reported accusations from five women - four of them named.\nAnd - in an article about New York Times reporter Glenn Thrush - Vox writer Laura McGann recounted her own experience, interviewed three other women, and spoke to 40 people in the wider media.\nWhich system is better - the UK or the US - depends on your point of view.\nIf you've been wrongly accused, you may yearn for the British system - where publishing is riskier.\nIf you're a victim, you may prefer the US system - where the constitution protects freedom of speech.\nEither way, the effect is clear. \nThe US has a flood of cases. In the UK, it remains drip-drip.", "date": "21 November 2017", "href": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-42070575", "tags": "us uk story media sued harassment accused new cases sexual many law"}
