(President Barack Obama eventually had to apologize for his promise in 2013.)\nUnder the GOP health care replacement legislation, older and low-income Americans who want to buy private health insurance would be hit the hardest, receiving less generous tax credits than they do under Obamacare. Younger and more affluent people, on the other hand, would receive more assistance than they currently do.\u00a0\nThat means older and lower-income individuals could pay more for their premiums and out-of-pocket costs. Others may simply drop their insurance \u2015 since there will be no mandate to have coverage under the Republican legislation \u2015 and would have no protection from sky-high medical bills at all.\u00a0\nHealth policy experts have found that the net effect of the Republican repeal bill would be to raise costs for the average insurance enrollee by $1,542 per year in 2017, and by $2,409 in 2020.\nWhile Price was trying to tamp down fears that people will have to pay more for health insurance under the GOP scheme, Gary Cohn, Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser, was trying to convince people that it doesn\u2019t matter whether fewer Americans will have coverage.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about coverage, it\u2019s about access to care, it\u2019s about access to be able to see your doctors,\u201d Cohn said in an interview on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cThe numbers of who\u2019s covered and who is not covered \u2015 that\u2019s interesting, and I know that may make some headlines, but what we care about is people\u2019s ability to get health care and people\u2019s ability to go see their doctor.\u201d\n\u201cCoverage is really important if you lose it,\u201d responded host Chris Wallace.\nThe GOP has not been able to figure out whether its plan will lead to coverage for more people, fewer \u2015 or, as Cohn tried to argue, it just doesn\u2019t really matter.\u00a0\nIn January, Trump vowed \u201cinsurance for everybody.\u201d On Friday, Price also promised, \u201cWe don\u2019t believe that individuals will lose coverage at all.\u201d But that same day, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) seemed to acknowledge his plan won\u2019t cover as many people, in an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt.\u00a0\n\u201cWe always know you\u2019re never going to win a coverage beauty contest when it\u2019s free market versus government mandates. If the government says thou shall buy our health insurance, the government estimates are going to say people will comply and it will happen,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when you replace that with we\u2019re going to have a free market, and you buy what you want to buy, they\u2019re going to say not nearly as many people are going to do that. That\u2019s just going to happen. And so you\u2019ll have those coverage estimates. We assume that\u2019s going to happen. That\u2019s not our goal.\u201d\nAnd on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d Sunday, Ryan admitted he actually has no idea how many people will lose coverage.\n\u201cI can\u2019t answer that question. It\u2019s up to people,\u201d he said.\nObamacare extended health insurance to 20 million people who didn\u2019t previously have it.\u00a0\nLow-income Americans would also face consequences in both access and cost under the repeal bill with the GOP\u2019s plan to get rid of the expansion of Medicaid and turn it into a block grant program.\nThe bill effectively repeals Medicaid as we know it, and replaces it with a system of limited block grants to states that pays per person, rather than by the cost of health care expenses. The difference will need to be made up by the 70 million elderly, poor and working-class people on Medicaid. While people often think of Medicare as the principal health care program for the elderly, it is Medicaid that covers nursing care.\u00a0\nThirty-one states and the District of Columbia have expanded eligibility for Medicaid under Obamacare, which has resulted in about 11 million\u00a0people getting coverage. But under the Republican bill, starting in 2020, the federal government would no longer provide federal funds for people who newly qualify under the expanded eligibility standards.\u00a0\nThe federal government would continue to provide funds for any expansion enrollee who was on the program before 2020 \u2015 until he or she left Medicaid.\u00a0\nCohn, however, was not worried about these changes in his \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d interview.\u00a0\n\u201cIf you are on Medicaid, you\u2019re going to stay,\u201d he said. The expansion is not going to change. There\u2019s a roll-off period. There\u2019s a period of transition, and we\u2019re very confident that the period of transition is going to work.\u201d\nWant more updates from Amanda Terkel?
