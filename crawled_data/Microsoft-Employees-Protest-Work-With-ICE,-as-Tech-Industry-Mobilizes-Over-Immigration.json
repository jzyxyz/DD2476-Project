{"title": "Microsoft Employees Protest Work With ICE, as Tech Industry Mobilizes Over Immigration", "content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In an open letter posted to Microsoft\u2019s internal message board on Tuesday, more than 100 employees protested the software maker\u2019s work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and asked the company to stop working with the agency, which has been separating migrant parents and their children at the border with Mexico.\n\u201cWe believe that Microsoft must take an ethical stand, and put children and families above profits,\u201d said the letter, which was addressed to the chief executive, Satya Nadella. The letter pointed to a $19.4 million contract that Microsoft has with ICE for processing data and artificial intelligence capabilities.\nCalling the separation of families \u201cinhumane,\u201d the employees added: \u201cAs the people who build the technologies that Microsoft profits from, we refuse to be complicit. We are part of a growing movement, comprised of many across the industry who recognize the grave responsibility that those creating powerful technology have to ensure what they build is used for good, and not for harm.\u201d\nThe letter is part of a wave of tech workers mobilizing this week against the Trump administration\u2019s new \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy that refers for criminal prosecution all immigrants apprehended crossing the border without authorization. The policy has resulted in about 2,000 children being separated from their migrant parents, raising a bipartisan outcry.\nAt Silicon Valley companies including Google, Apple and Facebook, employees have in recent days circulated internal emails asking for donations to nonprofit groups that support immigrants. Many have shared information about protests in San Francisco and Washington. And some of the workers have spoken to their managers about the issue or called on internal message boards for their chief executives to respond.\nThe activity has had an effect. Late on Tuesday, after Microsoft\u2019s employee letter went up, the company released a memo from Mr. Nadella in which he called the immigration policy \u201ccruel and abusive\u201d and said Microsoft was not working with the federal government on any projects to separate families. Microsoft\u2019s president, Brad Smith, also published a blog post titled, \u201cThe Country Needs to Get Immigration Right.\u201d\nTheir comments came after other tech chief executives spoke up on Tuesday. Apple\u2019s chief, Timothy D. Cook, in an interview with The Irish Times, called the immigration policy \u201cheartbreaking.\u201d Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX, tweeted that he was a \u201ctop donor\u201d to the American Civil Liberties Union and said that \u201cif there is some way for me to help these kids I will do so.\u201d Sundar Pichai of Google, Dara Khosrowshahi of Uber and Chuck Robbins of Cisco also tweeted their opposition to the policy.\nOn Facebook, two former employees of the social network started a fund-raiser on Saturday to collect $1,500 for migrants who needed legal assistance because of the new policy. By Tuesday afternoon, the effort had garnered more than $5 million from donors who included numerous tech workers, according to a spokeswoman for the fund-raising drive.\nAmong the donors were Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, and its chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, a Facebook spokesman said. In a Facebook post on Tuesday, Mr. Zuckerberg called for more donations and said the policy of splitting up immigrant children from their families needed to be stopped. Ms. Sandberg, in her own Facebook post, called the cries of the children taken from their parents \u201cunbearable\u201d and added that the practice \u201cneeds to end now.\u201d\nThe activity by tech workers is reminiscent of  protests in January 2017 when many Silicon Valley employees were up in arms over an executive order from President Trump that suspended immigration from seven mostly Muslim countries. At the time, Google employees held rallies to object; Amazon and Expedia were among the companies that filed in court to stop the order. (Many tech companies comprise workers who are first-generation immigrants or who grew up in immigrant families.)\nSince then, tech workers have watched their companies increasingly come under scrutiny for their moral and ethical behavior. Many tech employees have begun organizing against actions by their own companies \u2014 in April, for example, thousands of Google employees signed a letter protesting the company\u2019s involvement in a Pentagon program that uses artificial intelligence in weaponry.\nOn Monday, the A.C.L.U. also demanded that Amazon stop selling a facial recognition software tool, called Rekognition, to police and other government entities because it feared it could be used to unfairly target immigrants. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nMicrosoft, based in Redmond, Wash., publicly promoted its work with ICE in January in a blog post, citing it as an example of the success of its technology.\nAt the same time, Microsoft has been positioning itself as tech\u2019s moral leader. Mr. Nadella and Mr. Smith have publicly said they want to protect user privacy and establish ethical guidelines for new technology like artificial intelligence.\n\u201cWe need to ask ourselves not only what computers can do but what computers should do,\u201d Mr. Nadella said at Microsoft\u2019s developer conference last month.\nSome Microsoft executives earlier objected to the Trump administration\u2019s new immigration policy. On Sunday, Mr. Smith penned a LinkedIn post, saying the news of migrant children being taken from their families was \u201cespecially poignant.\u201d\nYet criticism of Microsoft\u2019s work with ICE began to grow. One Microsoft engineer, Larry Osterman, tweeted on Monday to ask how working with ICE matched with the company\u2019s \u201cethical stances.\u201d\nMat Marquis, an independent developer who works with Microsoft, also said in a tweet on Monday that he no longer planned to work with the company because of its ICE contract. When he receives his last payment from Microsoft, he said, he plans to donate the money to a group providing support to families that had been separated at the border.\nLate Monday, Microsoft issued a statement saying that it was not working with federal agencies to separate children from their families at the border and that it was not aware of its services or products being used for that purpose. It also said it was \u201cdismayed\u201d by the immigration policy and urged that it be changed.\nBut for many Microsoft employees, that was not satisfactory. A group of about a dozen employees began working together to draft the protest letter, in which they said the company\u2019s statement \u201cdoes not go far enough.\u201d\nThe employees continued, \u201cWe are providing the technical undergirding in support of an agency that is actively enforcing this inhumane policy.\u201d\nThe letter added that Microsoft should not only cancel its contract with ICE but be open to a review of its contracts with government agencies domestically and internationally, and that it should create a policy stating it would not work with those \u201cwho violate international human rights law.\u201d\nMicrosoft declined to comment on the employee letter, which was posted internally on Tuesday afternoon. Within hours, it had received more than 100 signatures.\nIt was only later that the messages from Mr. Nadella and Mr. Smith decrying the immigration policy were released. \u201cWe will always stand for immigration policies that preserve every person\u2019s dignity and human rights,\u201d Mr. Nadella said.", "date": "June 19, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/19/technology/tech-companies-immigration-border.html", "tags": "policy letter protest work immigration ice microsoft tech \u201d industry families employees mobilizes"}
