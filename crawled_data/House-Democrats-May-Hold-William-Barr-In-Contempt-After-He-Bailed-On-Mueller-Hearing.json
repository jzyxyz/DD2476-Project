{"title": "House Democrats May Hold William Barr In Contempt After He Bailed On Mueller Hearing", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2015 House Democrats signaled they\u2019d move towards holding Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress after the nation\u2019s top law enforcement official\u00a0refused to show up to a House Judiciary Committee hearing or provide a full copy of Robert Mueller\u2019s special counsel report in response to a subpoena.\nBarr had previously agreed to appear before the House committee, but the Justice Department objected when Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) indicated that, in addition to questions from members of the committee, a staff attorney would question Barr for an extended period.\u00a0A Barr spokeswoman called the plan \u201cunprecedented and unnecessary\u201d and \u201cinappropriate.\u201d\nDemocrats had also issued a broad subpoena seeking the full Mueller report and its underlying evidence. But the Justice Department said that the House Judiciary Committee\u00a0\u201clacks any legislative purpose for seeking the complete investigative files.\u201d\n\u201cIt is one thing for the Attorney General to disclose a written report of prosecutorial decisions, but quite another thing to open up the entirety of the investigative file to congressional review,\u201d Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd wrote in a letter to Nadler Wednesday evening.\nNadler, speaking in front of an empty chair where Barr was supposed to sit on Thursday, indicated that the next step could be to hold Barr in contempt.\n\u201cWe will have no choice but to move quickly to hold the attorney general in contempt if he stalls or fails to negotiate in good faith,\u201d Nadler said.\n\u201cThe attorney general of the United States is sworn to uphold the Constitution as our nation\u2019s chief law enforcement officer. He has an obligation to do everything in his power to warn the president of the damage he risks and the liability he assumes by directly threatening our system of checks and balances,\u201d Nadler said.\n\u201cSadly, the attorney general has failed in that responsibility,\u201d Nadler continued. \u201cHe has failed to check the president\u2019s worst instincts. He has not only misrepresented the findings of the special counsel. He has failed to protect the special counsel\u2019s investigation from unfair political attacks. He has himself unfairly attacked the special counsel\u2019s investigation. He has failed the men and women of the department by placing the needs of the president over the fair administration of justice. He has even failed to show up today.\u201d\nOn Friday, Nadler wrote a letter to the Department of Justice urging that it comply by 9 a.m. Monday with a subpoena for the full Mueller report and its underlying evidence or else face contempt of Congress proceedings.", "date": "\n05/02/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/barr-contempt-nadler-hearing_n_5ccaed77e4b0913d078dc7d8", "tags": "hearing may hold democrats bailed mueller committee nadler \u201d house failed attorney barr general william contempt"}
