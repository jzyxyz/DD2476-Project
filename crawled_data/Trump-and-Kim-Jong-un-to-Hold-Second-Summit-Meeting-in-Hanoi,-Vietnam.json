I look forward to seeing Chairman Kim & advancing the cause of peace!\u201d\nMr. Trump revealed in his State of the Union address this week that the meeting would be in Vietnam but did not disclose the city. The United States had explored Danang, a coastal city where American troops arrived in 1965 for a war that would scar a generation, but the North Koreans were reported to prefer Hanoi.\nMr. Trump and his aides have cited Vietnam as an example of a communist nation that emerged from international isolation to develop a dynamic economy. Mr. Trump has sought to persuade Mr. Kim that giving up his nuclear weapons would enable him to transform his impoverished land into a thriving country.\nThe meeting will be the second between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim after an inaugural get-together last June in Singapore. Mr. Trump emerged from that meeting declaring that he had all but resolved the decades-long nuclear dispute and later declared that he and Mr. Kim \u201cfell in love.\u201d\nBut while North Korea has refrained from further nuclear and missile tests, it has yet to make any concrete commitment to eliminating its arsenal.\n\u201cNorth Korea, under the leadership of Kim Jong Un, will become a great Economic Powerhouse,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted on Friday. \u201cHe may surprise some but he won\u2019t surprise me, because I have gotten to know him & fully understand how capable he is. North Korea will become a different kind of Rocket \u2014 an Economic one!\u201d", "date": "Feb. 8, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/08/us/politics/trump-kim-jong-un-hanoi.html", "tags": "hold korea nuclear summit second meeting trump \u201d jong-un kim north vietnam hanoi"}
