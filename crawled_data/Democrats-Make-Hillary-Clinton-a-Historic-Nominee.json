{"title": "Democrats Make Hillary Clinton a Historic Nominee", "content": "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 The Democratic convention formally nominated Hillary Clinton for president on Tuesday, making history by choosing a woman to be the first standard-bearer of a major political party, a breakthrough underscored by a deeply personal speech by Bill Clinton calling her \u201cthe best darn change-maker I have ever known.\u201d\nAt 6:39 p.m., the hall erupted in cheers and joyful tears as South Dakota cast the decisive 15 votes to put Mrs. Clinton over the threshold of 2,382 delegates required to clinch the nomination.\nA sea of delegates waved multicolored signs with Mrs. Clinton\u2019s \u201cH\u201d campaign logo, while others fell into hugs and several women jumped up and down with elation.\nVince Insalaco, the chairman of the Democratic Party of Arkansas, where the Clintons built their public profile over two decades, said the choice of the first female presidential nominee was a historic moment.\n\u201cI\u2019m so proud to be a Democrat tonight,\u201d Mr. Insalaco said, \u201cand so proud that we can call this woman one of our own.\u201d\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s primary rival, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, played a symbolic role in hopes of unifying the party behind her. After Vermont arranged to go last in the roll call, Mr. Sanders joined its delegation to roars of \u201cBernie, Bernie\u201d and called on the party to rally behind Mrs. Clinton.\nBut it was the appearance of Mr. Clinton, shortly after 10 p.m., that stirred the crowd most, as he set out to share a more personal side of the sometimes-reserved former secretary of state.\nUnspooling memories of their 45 years together, Mr. Clinton used warm and detailed anecdotes to argue that the couple\u2019s political enemies had spent decades creating a \u201ccartoon\u201d of his wife that he was now determined to puncture. Mrs. Clinton is among the most unpopular presidential nominees in modern history, and the former president appealed to the audience to see through the political attacks on her.\n\u201cOne is real,\u201d Mr. Clinton said of the divergent portrayals of his wife, \u201cthe other is made up.\u201d He recalled the affection of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s old friends, her empathy for those in need, and the praise she had won from Republicans as a senator and as secretary of state.\n\u201cYou nominated the real one,\u201d Mr. Clinton said to a long burst of applause. Seeming to realize that he had been speaking for 38 minutes, he added in classically loquacious Bill Clinton fashion, \u201cWe have to get back on schedule.\u201d\nMr. Clinton\u2019s testimony was so personal that he even appeared to obliquely invoke problems in the couple\u2019s marriage.\n\u201cShe\u2019ll never quit when the going gets tough,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019ll never quit on you.\u201d\nEarlier in the evening, several dozen Sanders delegates paraded off in a coordinated demonstration against Mrs. Clinton\u2019s nomination. Some of them said beforehand that they were attending their first Democratic convention and felt no party loyalty or compulsion to fall in line behind Mrs. Clinton, whom they described as insufficiently progressive on new banking regulations, a $15 minimum wage, a ban on fracking and other issues.\n\u201cI\u2019m just not there yet in terms of supporting Hillary, because her words are only her words, and I don\u2019t fully trust that she\u2019ll act on our agenda,\u201d said Ingrid Olson, 38, a delegate from Iowa.\nThe final delegate count was 2,842 for Mrs. Clinton, 1,865 for Mr. Sanders and 56 \u201cno votes.\u201d\nThe scenes in the hall, and the huge street protests that continued through Tuesday night, were more fractious than those at the party\u2019s gathering in Denver in 2008. Back then, Mrs. Clinton, defeated for the nomination, moved to stop the roll call and nominate Barack Obama. Her gesture, aimed at soothing the bitterness of the primary fight, helped her supporters make peace with Mr. Obama and embrace his barrier-breaking candidacy.\nMr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton had their own brutal competition this year, and their policy differences were greater than those between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama \u2014 part of why many of Mr. Sanders\u2019s supporters are reluctant to get behind her.\nMr. Clinton\u2019s task was clear: to humanize his wife but also energize Democrats by flattering those in the hall and villainizing Donald J. Trump, the Republican nominee.\n\u201cShe never made fun of people with disabilities,\u201d Mr. Clinton said, referring to Mr. Trump\u2019s mocking of a disabled reporter last year. \u201cShe tried to empower them based on their abilities.\u201d\nYet as Mr. Clinton recounted his wife\u2019s well-chronicled professional accomplishments, he also tried to paint a portrait of a mother who is not as well known. Recounting the day they moved their daughter, Chelsea, into her freshman dorm at Stanford University, Mr. Clinton recounted how Mrs. Clinton kept looking for \u201cone more drawer to put that liner paper in,\u201d reluctant to say goodbye to her only child.\nThe speech was extraordinary in its intimacy and in Mr. Clinton\u2019s willingness to use their much-scrutinized marriage as a testament to her character. He began by recalling how he first met his future wife in 1971 at Yale Law School \u2014 he so nervous, she full of confidence \u2014 and spent almost 15 minutes describing courting her and proposing marriage three times before she said yes. At one point, trying to play a mind game, Mr. Clinton told her that she should move to Illinois or New York and run for office rather than marry him and have other young Democrats eclipse her.\n\u201cThey mean well, and they speak well, but none of them are as good as you are,\u201d Mr. Clinton told her about their political generation. \u201cShe said: \u2018Are you out of your mind? Nobody would ever vote for me.\u2019 \u201d\nThe convention underwent a notable shift as the evening went on: Mr. Sanders was barely mentioned, a deliberate decision by the Clinton campaign officials who organized the lineup of speakers. Advisers said that, with Mrs. Clinton now the nominee, they wanted to focus on her character and political record, and on taking the fight to Mr. Trump, rather than continuing to nod to Mr. Sanders and his primary fight.\nThe crowd was subdued for much of the evening, but in the most searing part, nine African-American mothers whose children were killed by gun violence or in encounters with the police took the stage to chants of \u201cBlack lives matter.\u201d The women, who have been campaigning for Mrs. Clinton for months, described how she had sat with them privately to hear their stories and worked with them to promote gun-control measures.\nOne of the mothers, Lucia McBath \u2014 whose 17-year-old son, Jordan Davis, was fatally shot after playing loud music in his car in 2012 \u2014 said Mrs. Clinton \u201cisn\u2019t afraid to say black lives matter,\u201d a phrase Mr. Trump and other Republicans have derided by saying that all lives matter. But Ms. McBath also said Mrs. Clinton knew that Americans needed to come together to keep children safe.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to keep building a future where police officers and communities of color work together in mutual respect,\u201d she said.\nConvention organizers, apparently seeking a balance with the mothers, invited the Pittsburgh police chief, Cameron McLay, to speak earlier in the evening. But as Chief McLay spoke of fallen officers and called for a criminal justice overhaul, many in the hall carried on their conversations.\nDemocrats used Tuesday to appeal to some of their traditional constituencies, but they also highlighted Mrs. Clinton\u2019s faith. A video was played in which she asked for a prayer and then joined a prayer circle, and an image on one of the screens for part of the evening showed a group of people laying hands on her.\nIt was a striking, and surely not accidental, contrast to the Republican convention last week, in which appeals to the faithful were somewhat muted and Mr. Trump scarcely mentioned faith in his acceptance speech.\nThe hosannas for Mrs. Clinton were in marked contrast to the steady stream of boos that rained down at the mention of her name on Monday. Still, the party\u2019s divisions remained in plain sight.\nMany states announced that they had split their delegates by having representatives of Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders speak separately. And it was clear that some Sanders supporters were not ready to give up. Tim Vandeveer, the chairman of the Hawaii Democratic Party, announced that Mr. Sanders had won a majority of the state\u2019s delegates, calling him \u201cthe leader of our revolution, which shall continue.\u201d\nLater, as the convention wound down after 11 p.m., black and white images of every previous president flashed on the screen, which finally seemed to crack as a smiling Mrs. Clinton suddenly appeared by video connection.\nThe hall broke out in applause and shouts of excitement as Mrs. Clinton acknowledged breaking the glass ceiling.\n\u201cIf there are any little girls out there who stayed up late to watch,\u201d she said, \u201clet me just say, I may become the first woman president, but one of you is next.\u201d", "date": "July 26, 2016", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/27/us/politics/dnc-speakers-sanders-clinton.html", "tags": "\u201c make democrats hillary clinton nominee party one \u2014 sanders mrs. historic"}
