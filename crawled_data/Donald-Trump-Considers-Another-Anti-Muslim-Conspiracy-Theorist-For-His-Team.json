{"title": "Donald Trump Considers Another Anti-Muslim Conspiracy Theorist For His Team", "content": "Back in March 2016, when the GOP primary was still a going concern and the candidates were jockeying for endorsements and assistants, we made note of the fact that Texas Sen. Ted Cruz had gone out of his way to bring into his inner circle a new foreign policy adviser who\u2019d basically distinguished himself as one of the few people in American politics more overtly anti-Muslim than Donald Trump.\u00a0\nWell, time sure flies! That adviser, Frank Gaffney, has now joined up with the Trump transition team, in some late-breaking news on a long day of clown-show crackups from Trump\u2019s squad of irregulars.\nUPDATE: Nov. 16 \u2015\u00a0Benjy Sarlin of MSNBC tweeted Wednesday morning that Gaffney is\u00a0not on Trump\u2019s transition team. During an appearance on the network, Trump spokesman Jason Miller confirmed that Gaffney is not a member of, or advising, the team.\u00a0\nGaffney, once described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as \u201cone of America\u2019s most notorious Islamophobes,\u201d\u00a0heads the Center for Security Policy. It\u2019s a think tank of sorts, well known for promoting conspiratorial theories about the Muslim Brotherhood infiltrating the U.S. government at high levels and the Sharia system replacing American democracy. (As we reported yesterday, Clare Lopez, who is a similar anti-Muslim paranoiac, is under consideration to be a deputy national security adviser in the Trump administration.)\nGaffney has long been on Trump\u2019s radar. In fact, it was a\u00a0bogus survey, created by Gaffney,\u00a0which claimed to reveal that many U.S. Muslims were willing to use violence against other Americans and that even more wanted the option to be governed by Sharia, that Trump cited when he famously called for\u00a0\u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country\u2019s representatives can figure out what is going on.\u201d\nHere are some of the more outrageous claims Gaffney has made:\nA few years ago, it looked as though the Republican Party was ready to sever ties with Gaffney and his inflammatory claims. He was banned from the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in 2011 after accusing Norquist and Khan of ties to the Muslim Brotherhood.\nBut since then, Gaffney has staged a comeback. GOP presidential hopefuls Cruz, Trump, Carly Fiorina, Ben Carson, Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee all appeared at his group\u2019s events last year. Months ago, Cruz offered the following praise for the zealot: \u201cFrank is a patriot, he loves this country, and he\u2019s clear-eyed about radical Islamic terrorism.\u201d\nNews that Gaffney could play a role on Trump\u2019s transition team as a national security adviser is very,\u00a0very bad news for Muslim Americans, to say the least.\nClarification: Language in this article has been amended to comport with the original headline that Gaffney was being considered for, but had not officially joined, Trump\u2019s transition team.\n~~~~~\nJessica Schulberg is a reporter covering foreign policy and national security for The Huffington Post.
