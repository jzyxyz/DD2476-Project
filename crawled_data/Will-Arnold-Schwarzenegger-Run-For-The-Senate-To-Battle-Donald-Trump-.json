That\u2019s when Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) will be up for re-election.\u00a0\nThe former California governor could make a bid as a Republican or as an independent candidate. If he sticks with the GOP, he\u2019ll be a very different Republican from Trump\u00a0\u2014 one who believes in climate change, immigration and redistricting reform to fix gerrymandering.\u00a0\nThe two men have already butted heads over \u201cCelebrity Apprentice.\u201d Trump, an executive producer of the show, has blamed Schwarzenegger for the program\u2019s falling ratings.\u00a0\nSchwarzenegger shot back that he hoped Trump would work as hard for all of the American people as he did for his ratings.\nAfter Trump opened the annual National Prayer Breakfast in January with a request for\u00a0prayers that Schwarzenegger\u2019s ratings would rise, the Terminator tweeted a video suggesting that maybe they should switch jobs.
