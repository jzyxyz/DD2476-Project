{"title": "Google and Facebook Face Criticism for Ads Targeting Racist Sentiments", "content": "Google and Facebook, the world\u2019s biggest sellers of online advertising, faced sharp criticism on Friday for allowing advertisers to direct ads to users who searched for or expressed an interest in racist sentiments and hate speech.\nIn response to two separate news reports exposing the issues, both companies said they would change how their systems worked.\nThe criticism began on Thursday after a report from ProPublica, a nonprofit news site, revealed that Facebook enabled advertisers to seek out self-described \u201cJew haters\u201d and other anti-Semitic topics. The company responded by saying that it would restrict how advertisers targeted their audiences on the social network.\nOn Friday, an article from BuzzFeed reported how Google allowed the sale of ads tied to racist and bigoted keywords, and automatically suggested more offensive terms as part of that process. By midday, Google said it would work harder to halt offensive ads.\nThe incidents added to a growing awareness of the complicated \u2014 and powerful \u2014 automated advertising systems that have turned Facebook and Google into two of the world\u2019s most valuable companies. The companies have learned how to maximize their ability to connect any size of advertiser to highly tailored groups of people who use their services every day, collecting billions of dollars in the process.\nBut the potential misuse of those tools has become a national concern in the past year, particularly after Facebook disclosed last week that fake accounts based in Russia had purchased more than $100,000 worth of ads on divisive issues in the lead-up to the presidential election.\n\u201cIt\u2019s shocking because it\u2019s illustrating the degree of targeting that\u2019s possible,\u201d said Eli Pariser, the author of \u201cThe Filter Bubble: How the New Personalized Web Is Changing What We Read and How We Think.\u201d \u201cBut I think the critical piece of context is this is happening when we know that a foreign country used targeted Facebook ads to influence opinion around an election.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cBefore all of this, you could see the rise of targeted advertising, you could see the rise of social politics, but the conjunction of the two in this way feels new.\u201d\nFacebook\u2019s self-service ad-buying platform allowed advertisers to direct ads to the news feeds of about 2,300 people who said they were interested in anti-Semitic subjects, according to the article by ProPublica. Facebook\u2019s algorithms automatically generated the categories from users\u2019 profiles.\nReporters from ProPublica tested Facebook advertising categories to see whether they could buy ads aimed at people who expressed interest in topics like \u201cJew hater,\u201d \u201cHow to burn jews,\u201d and \u201cHistory of \u2018why jews ruin the world.\u2019\u201d The reporters paid $30 to promote ProPublica posts to the people affiliated with the anti-Semitic categories to ensure they were real options, according to the investigation, which noted that Facebook had approved the posts within 15 minutes.\nFacebook said in a statement that users had entered the terms under the \u201cemployer\u201d or \u201ceducation\u201d fields on their profiles. Doing so violated the company\u2019s policies, the company said, and led to their appearance on the ad-buying tool.\nThe company said it would remove targeting by such self-reported fields \u201cuntil we have the right processes in place to help prevent this issue.\u201d It added that \u201chate speech and discriminatory advertising have no place on our platform.\u201d\nAfter the ProPublica report, BuzzFeed conducted a similar test on Google, where ads are purchased based on potential search terms. The site reported that upon entering terms like \u201cwhy do Jews ruin everything\u201d and \u201cwhite people ruin,\u201d the automated system suggested long lists of offensive \u201ckeyword ideas\u201d like \u201cblack people ruin neighborhoods\u201d and \u201cJewish parasites.\u201d It then allowed the purchase of some of the terms for ads.\nGoogle said that it informed advertisers when their ads were offensive and rejected, and that not all suggested keywords were eligible for purchase.\n\u201cIn this instance, ads didn\u2019t run against the vast majority of these keywords, but we didn\u2019t catch all these offensive suggestions,\u201d Sridhar Ramaswamy, Google\u2019s senior vice president of ads, said in a statement. \u201cThat\u2019s not good enough, and we\u2019re not making excuses. We\u2019ve already turned off these suggestions, and any ads that made it through, and will work harder to stop this from happening again.\u201d\nThe Daily Beast noted on Friday that Twitter was also allowing people to target ads based on some racial slurs. But the greater scrutiny is on Facebook and Google, given their sheer size and dominance of the online advertising business, which brings each company tens of billions of dollars in revenue a year.\nLast week, Facebook representatives briefed the Senate and House Intelligence Committees, which are investigating Russian intervention in the election, about ads on the site. The company told congressional investigators that it had identified more than $100,000 worth of ads on hot-button issues that were traced back to a Russian company with links to the Kremlin.\nThe ads \u2014 about 3,000 of them \u2014 focused on divisive topics like gay rights, gun control, race and immigration, and they were linked to 470 fake accounts and pages that Facebook subsequently took down, according to its chief security officer. Facebook has not released copies of the ads to the public.\nLast fall, Facebook came under fire  after ProPublica reported that advertisers could use its targeting to exclude certain races, or what the social network called \u201cethnic affinities,\u201d from housing and employment ads, a potential violation of the Fair Housing Act of 1968 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Facebook, which assigns the updated term \u201cmulticultural affinity\u201d to certain users based on their interests and activities on the site, no longer allows it to be used in ads for housing, employment or credit.\nThese series of problems with advertising make the company look unprepared to handle the power of its ad system, said Benjamin Edelman, an associate professor at Harvard Business School.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve created a very complicated ad platform \u2014 it has all kinds of options and doodads and things working automatically and manually, and they don\u2019t know what they built,\u201d Professor Edelman said. \u201cThe machine has a mind of its own.\u201d\nMr. Pariser said the types of targeting reported this week made a strong argument for increased disclosure of the funding behind political ads online, especially on Facebook. The Federal Election Commission voted on Thursday to seek public comment on disclosure requirements around online political ads, which advocates hope will lead to rules requiring more disclaimers revealing who paid for online content.\n\u201cThis is drawing a new level of public awareness to how targeted advertising can be used to manipulate and affect politics and political conversation in ways that didn\u2019t used to be feasible at all or easy,\u201d Mr. Pariser said.", "date": "Sept. 15, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/15/business/facebook-advertising-anti-semitism.html", "tags": "ads face criticism sentiments company \u201d facebook racist advertisers targeting advertising google"}
