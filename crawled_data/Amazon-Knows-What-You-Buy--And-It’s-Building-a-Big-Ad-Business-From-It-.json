{"title": "Amazon Knows What You Buy. And It\u2019s Building a Big Ad Business From It.", "content": "SEATTLE \u2014 When a chain of physical therapy centers wanted new patients, it aimed online ads at people near its offices who had bought knee braces recently on Amazon.\nWhen a financial services provider wanted to promote its retirement advisory business, it directed ads to people in their 40s and 50s who had recently ordered a personal finance book from Amazon.\nAnd when a major credit card company wanted new customers, it targeted people who used cards from other banks on the retail site.\nThe advertisers found those people by using Amazon\u2019s advertising services, which leverage what the company knows better than anyone: consumers\u2019 online buying habits.\n\u201cAmazon has really straightforward database \u2014 they know what I buy,\u201d said Daniel Knijnik, co-founder of Quartile Digital, an Amazon-focused ad agency that oversaw the ads for the clinics and retirement services. \u201cFor an advertiser, that\u2019s a dream.\u201d\nAds sold by Amazon, once a limited offering at the company, can now be considered a third major pillar of its business, along with e-commerce and cloud computing. Amazon\u2019s advertising business is worth about $125 billion, more than Nike or IBM, Morgan Stanley estimates. At its core are ads placed on Amazon.com by makers of toilet paper or soap that want to appear near product search results on the site.\nBut many ad agencies are particularly excited by another area of advertising that is less obvious to many consumers. The company has been steadily expanding its business of selling video or display ads \u2014 the square and rectangular ads on sites across the web \u2014 and gaining ground on the industry leaders, Google and Facebook.\nIn addition to knowing what people buy, Amazon also knows where people live, because they provide delivery addresses, and which credit cards they use. It knows how old their children are from their baby registries, and who has a cold, right now, from cough syrup ordered for two-hour delivery. And the company has been expanding a self-service option for ad agencies and brands to take advantage of its data on shoppers.\n\u201cThat is where the insane scale can happen for the business,\u201d said John Denny, a vice president at CAVU Venture Partners, which invests in consumer brands like Bulletproof coffee and Hippeas chickpea puffs.\nMajor online ad networks offer different ways to target customers. A brand that sells running shirts for women might turn to Google to find people who the company believes are female and interested in running based on their search and browsing history. The company may turn to Facebook for people in a women\u2019s running group.\nMany of Amazon\u2019s features are similar to those of Google or Facebook, like offering ways to target users based on their interests, searches and demographics. But Amazon\u2019s ad system can also remove a lot of the guesswork by showing ads to people who have bought the shirts on Amazon.com.\nAdvertisers have long run some targeted campaigns through Amazon\u2019s ad network. Many have done that by working directly with Amazon\u2019s staff, who would place their orders on their behalf. That option has historically been focused on larger brands because it requires a minimum advertising commitment. Over time, Amazon has given more advertisers and their agencies access to the self-service system to run their own targeting campaigns on and off Amazon\u2019s websites, and at a variety of spending levels.\nUsers of the self-service system can choose from hundreds of automated audience segments. Some of Amazon\u2019s targeting capabilities are dependent on shopping behaviors, such as \u201cInternational Market Grocery Shopper\u201d and people who have bought \u201cAcne Treatments\u201d in the past month, or household demographics, such as \u201cPresence of children aged 4-6.\u201d Others are based on the media people consume on Amazon, such as \u201cDenzel Washington Fans\u201d or people who have recently streamed fitness and exercise videos on Amazon. The company declined to comment.\nJust the Cheese, a brand run by Specialty Cheese Company in Reeseville, Wis., makes crunchy dried cheese bars that have taken off as a low-carb snack. By using algorithms to analyze how Just the Cheese\u2019s search ads performed on Amazon\u2019s site, the ad agency Quartile Digital noticed that people who searched for keto snacks and cauliflower pizza crust, both low-carb diet trends, also bought a lot of cheese bars. So Quartile ran display ads across the web targeting Amazon customers who had bought those two specific product categories. Over three months, Amazon showed the ads on websites more than six million times, which resulted in almost 22,000 clicks and more than 4,000 orders.\nThat 20 percent conversion rate \u2014 a sale to one out of five people who clicked on the ads \u2014 was \u201camazing,\u201d Mr. Knijnik said. \u201cThat is the kind of powerful granularity for building the target audiences that just Amazon can give you.\u201d\nLike other ad networks, Amazon uses cookies and other technical tools to track customers from its site onto other websites. They let the company know that a person who recently bought a diet book is now reading news on CNN and could be targeted on that site with an ad for a protein bar. Amazon does not tell the advertisers who that user is, but it does serve her ads on the brand\u2019s behalf.\nLast year, Amazon released a tool similar to those used by some other ad networks. That tool embeds a piece of computer code known as a pixel in ads shown on other sites, and tracks how that particular ad placement leads to customers viewing a product on Amazon or buying it outright.\n\u201cThey want more branding dollars, those TV dollars; that is really part of the reason they launched that advertising attribution data,\u201d said Melissa Burdick, who worked on Amazon\u2019s ad teams before leaving to found Pacvue, which provides tools for brands to optimize Amazon ads.\nAside from shopping habits, consumers give Amazon other information that it uses to aim ads. For example, Amazon\u2019s website has a section called \u201cGarage,\u201d where customers can submit their car\u2019s make and model information to make sure they buy parts that fit. In 2015, Amazon used Garage data to help an auto insurer target specific customers, according to a case study on its site. Now, on their own, brands can choose to show ads to drivers who have an Acura MDX as opposed to people who have an Acura TL via Amazon\u2019s ad portal.\nAmazon has slowly been developing ways for brands to target their own customers and shoppers, like other ad networks have offered for a while. Advertisers can upload their own customer lists, which Amazon matches with its database, and then show ads to those customers, or other people Amazon\u2019s algorithms determine are similar.\nMr. Denny of CAVU Venture Partners pointed to one of his firm\u2019s investments, One Brands, which sells protein bars on Amazon. The company can retarget customers who looked at the product page for its birthday cake-flavored bars, as well as so-called look-alike audiences that lets One Brands find consumers whose shopping behavior Amazon has determined is similar to people who have bought the bars before.\nIt not only finds those customers, but Amazon automatically shows different ads to different people based on their shopping behavior. People who do a lot of research on products may see an ad that features positive product reviews, whereas those who have signed up for regular deliveries of other products in the past might see an ad offering a discount for those who \u201cSubscribe & Save.\u201d\n\u201cEarly tests are showing this is insanely powerful,\u201d Mr. Denny said. \u201cThey can do this and nobody else can come close.\u201d", "date": "Jan. 20, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/20/technology/amazon-ads-advertising.html", "tags": "ads company ad building business bought \u201d customers buy knows brands amazon big"}
