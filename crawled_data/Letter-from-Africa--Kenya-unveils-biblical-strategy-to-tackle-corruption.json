{"title": "Letter from Africa: Kenya unveils biblical strategy to tackle corruption", "content": "In our series of letters from African journalists, Kenyan Joseph Warungu looks at the new strategy by the country's anti-corruption body to use the Bible to deter theft of public funds.\nYou know you are in deep trouble when nothing else can save you except prayer.\nThat's where Kenya is at the moment. \nThe country is sinking into deep debt, much of it the result of widespread mismanagement of public funds. \nCorruption is eating us up alive, with new scandals emerging day after day. \nAnd nothing is sacred, not even the water we need for life. \nIn parts of the capital, Nairobi, criminal cartels with alleged connections to some powerful people at the Nairobi county government are reportedly secretly disconnecting water supplies to whole residential estates. \nThis creates an artificial shortage, which they benefit from by selling water to the residents from their water trucks businesses.\nThat's why I'm in prayer mode. \nBut it's not the only reason. \nJoseph Warungu:\nYou might find it hard to prove officially that you gave birth to a Kenyan until you give birth to another child - called cash.\nThe Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC), the country's official body for fighting corruption, appears overwhelmed by the scale of the problem. \nIt has tried many things but nothing seems to be working. \nIndeed the problem appears to be getting worse, according to the commission's new national survey on corruption, which was published earlier this month.\nThe figure for those who paid bribes to receive government services has risen to 62%, up from 46% just two years ago.  \nInstitutions where bribes were most commonly paid: \nSource: Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission survey\nOne of the services said to be most prone to bribes was the collection of birth certificates. \nSo as a mother, although you may have carried a pregnancy for nine months and then given birth to a baby, the pain is not over.\nYou might find it hard to prove officially that you gave birth to a Kenyan until you give birth to another child - called cash. \nAnd there's yet another problem when it comes to reporting incidents of corruption. \nAccording to the EACC's survey, the police service was ranked first among government departments and agencies perceived to be most prone to corruption. \nSo you have nothing to drink at home because your water supply has been illegally disconnected.  \nYou cannot be reconnected because the people behind your headache are well connected to the powers that be.\nThe police will also be unlikely to help you unless you give them \"something to eat.\"\nYou're thirsty, they're hungry and the nation is tired.\nThe EACC itself is fed up.\nIt wants to do something but Kenyans will not do anything. \nAccording to its survey, 61% of the respondents have done nothing to support the fight against corruption and promote sound ethical standards in the country.\nWhy? Well, because they're scared. \nThe survey says the majority of Kenyans do not report corruption and unethical behaviour for investigation, because they fear potential harassment and reprisal.\nSo running out of ideas for tackling this menace, the anti-corruption commission has turned to a new weapon - the Bible. \nIt recently launched the Bible Study Guide to enhance its fight against corruption, hoping this will make a difference in this supposedly God-fearing country.\nThe commission itself is led by retired Anglican Archbishop Eliud Wabukala, a man of God who knows his Bible very well. \nThe EACC says that the Bible Study Guide is intended to help Kenyans \"interact with the Bible and discover God's position on corruption, and his direction on living a corruption-free life\".\nPresident Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto appear to have had their own Bible study six years ago when they won their first election.\nThey said their policies came straight out of the holy book.\nMr Ruto recently reminded everyone that the governing Jubilee Party's manifesto was anchored on biblical teachings, saying, \"the commitment to deliver on our pledges is more out of the belief that we are working for God rather than men\".\nSo clearly the good bishop is in good company.\nI personally have nothing against the Bible. \nI read it regularly and I know of quite a few characters in there who were deeply corrupt, starting with Judas Iscariot, a disciple of Christ who betrayed him for a fee only to take his own life later.\nBut there are a few questions that I and fellow Kenyans would like the good bishop to bear in mind.\nMany of the top leaders who have been accused of, or charged with, corruption are church-going, Bible readers. \nIs there another version of the holy book that the bishop could recommend to them?\nSecondly, some of the money stolen from the public, finds its way to the church in the form of offerings or tithe. \nIs the church in Kenya in danger of money-laundering?\nThirdly, what study guide will the bishop recommend to non-Christians? \nDoes corruption not affect them too?\nAs I write this, I suspect some of the \"tenderpreneurs\" - infamous cartels that bribe their way to fat government tenders - are busy plotting to submit an inflated proposal to procure and distribute a free copy of the Bible to all Kenyans. The anti-corruption commission currently has no such plans.\nThe knees of many Kenyans are sore from constant prayer for Kenya to emerge from the pipeline of catastrophes that engulf it.\nThey will be praying that once the anti-corruption commission conquers the spiritual battle, it will come up with tangible worldly tools to fight the disciples of corruption on the ground.\nThere is a famous Kenyan proverb from my people which says: \"When the lead cow develops a limp, the herd will never reach the watering hole.\"\nIn other words, the culture change must flow from the top.\nMore from Joseph Warungu:", "date": "16 October 2018", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-45863819", "tags": "letter commission nothing country kenya bible corruption tackle kenyans water anti-corruption unveils africa birth survey strategy biblical"}
