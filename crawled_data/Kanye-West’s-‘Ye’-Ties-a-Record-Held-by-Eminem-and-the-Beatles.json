Its artwork was apparently finished on the way to its listening party in Wyoming. And the album\u2019s prerelease publicity tour included Mr. West calling 400 years of slavery \u201ca choice.\u201d\nYet the album still opened at No. 1 on Billboard\u2019s chart, becoming Mr. West\u2019s eighth in a row to reach the top \u2014 tying a record of consecutive chart-toppers that is held only by Eminem and the Beatles.\n\u201cYe\u201d had 180 million streams and sold 85,000 copies as a full album, according to Nielsen, giving it the equivalent of 208,000 album sales in the United States in its first week out. Unlike Mr. West\u2019s last album, \u201cThe Life of Pablo,\u201d which was at first available only through Tidal, \u201cYe\u201d was widely available on major streaming services from the start.\n[Never miss a pop music story: Sign up for our weekly newsletter, Louder.]\nAlso this week, Post Malone\u2019s \u201cBeerbongs & Bentleys,\u201d another recent streaming hit, held at No. 2 in its sixth week out, with 121 million streams.
