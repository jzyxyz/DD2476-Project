{"title": "She Who Produces the Receipts Controls the Narrative", "content": "It used to be in reality television that if it didn\u2019t happen on camera, it didn\u2019t happen at all. But producers have found creative ways to address offscreen plot developments. They coax contestants to explain situations during talking head interviews. They stage re-enactments to cover for not having captured the drama. In recent years, on shows where participants are allowed to keep their phones, cast members have taken matters into their own hands and filmed things themselves if cameras weren\u2019t rolling.\nConsider an exchange from the reunion episode of Season 5 of Bravo\u2019s \u201cThe Real Housewives of Atlanta.\u201d Phaedra Parks was feuding with Kenya Moore over whose workout video was more successful.\n\u201cThe truth is, the numbers speak for themselves,\u201d Ms. Moore said of the reviews for her \u201cBooty Boot Camp\u201d versus Ms. Parks\u2019s \u201cPhine Body: Donkey Booty.\u201d\n\u201cIn the words of Whitney Houston, show me the receipts,\u201d Ms. Parks responded, as the rest of the women and the \u201cHousewives\u201d puppeteer Andy Cohen dissolved into laughter.\nIt\u2019s a subject of feverish debate in modern society how much is \u201creal\u201d about the exchanges on these shows. Producers push contestants to pursue spicy story lines. Editors splice together bits of conversation that make it sound as though someone said something they did not in a technique known as \u201cfrankenbiting.\u201d\nBut as the medium evolves, its participants and viewers have become increasingly fixated on telling their truth by doing as Ms. Parks suggested, and showing the receipts.\nThe phrase is said to have originated with a 2002 interview of the late Whitney Houston by Diane Sawyer. In it, Ms. Houston denies having a drug habit with an enormous price tag. \u201cI wanna see the receipts from the drug dealer that I bought $730,000 worth of drugs from,\u201d Ms. Houston says. \u201cI wanna see the receipts.\u201d\nInvoking \u201cthe receipts\u201d has become an easy way for celebrities and their observers to explain that something that has been alleged can actually be proven or disproved, though some people have been slower to pick up on its meaning. A central drama in the current season of \u201cThe Real Housewives of New York\u201d is the ongoing feud between Carole Radziwill and her former close friend Bethenny Frankel. One of their arguments revolves around whether Ms. Radziwill sent a \u201cthank you\u201d text to Ms. Frankel. They settle the dispute by consulting their message histories. Ms. Radziwill discovered, after the episode aired, that there\u2019s a term for this kind of proof. \u201cI have the receipts,\u201d she said. \u201cI learned this thing on Twitter, they say, \u2018Oh Carole, brings the receipts,\u2019 and I was like, what does that mean? And it means that I have the proof.\u201d\nReceipts come in many forms: texts, DMs, Instagrams, video recordings, audio recordings, Facebook posts, tweets, photos, videos. And while they are now a driving force of the gossip cycle \u2014 a celebrity makes a claim about another celebrity, the accused comments back, the accuser brings \u201cthe receipts\u201d in order to prove their original claim \u2014 they have also become an integral part of what we see play out on reality shows and in reality.\nIt\u2019s become a hallmark of \u201cgood TV\u201d to show a reality star assert something and cut screen back to a moment, previously filmed, when they said or did the opposite \u2014 the ultimate \u201cgotcha\u201d moment. That\u2019s the producers unfurling their receipts. But increasingly often the tables are turned: The internet has given power to reality TV stars who were once completely at the mercy of those controlling the presentation of their narratives.\nTake the Season 1 \u201cWAGS Miami\u201d reunion. The show is part of a franchise that includes \u201cWAGS L.A.\u201d and \u201cWAGS Atlanta,\u201d which follow the wives, girlfriends and wannabe girlfriends of athletes in those cities. Much of the drama that occurs between them is fueled not by what happens on camera but on the social media platforms where they harvest their income through sponsored posts.\nThe night the reunion aired, the cast member Claudia Sampedro went off in a Twitter rant. She was upset that a fellow cast member, Hencha Voigt, had behaved differently on set than she did in the \u201creal\u201d world. On Twitter, Ms. Sampedro said she was going to \u201cpull out the receipts\u201d of her relationship with Ms. Voigt, and made good on her threat by tweeting various text messages the two exchanged during the filming of the show.\nIt\u2019s much more difficult to suspend doubt about the reality of it all when contestants break character and reveal secrets in order to tell their side of the story. \u201cI was mad surprised when I watched the show!\u201d Ms. Sampedro said on Twitter, before going on to blame the show producers for misrepresenting her.\nMs. Sampedro\u2019s reveals may have been cathartic for her, but the details of her claims didn\u2019t make it into \u201cWAGS Miami.\u201d \u201cClaudia, I really don\u2019t have hate for you,\u201d Ms. Voigt told her in the Season 2 premiere. \u201cIf you want to move forward, I\u2019m over it.\u201d\nHow these shows incorporate cast members\u2019 claims about what \u201creally\u201d happened differs from program to program. The \u201cBachelor\u201d franchise is known for its tight hold on contestants and plots, which has only slightly loosened in recent years. But bloggers like Steve Carbone, who spoils \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d and its spinoffs on his website Reality Steve, benefit greatly from production\u2019s unwillingness \u2014 save for a few occasions \u2014 to acknowledge what is happening outside of filming until the show is over, if even then.\nThough the biggest attention each season goes to his reporting about finalists and proposals, his stories have increasingly included gossip about the goings-on and back stories of cast members, often sourced by viewers. Fan-unearthed racist tweets from one white cast member featured during Rachel Lindsay\u2019s recent season of \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d didn\u2019t come up on the show explicitly, but whether producers knew about his beliefs was heavily debated online, and there was a noteworthy fixation on the racial tensions between him and a fellow black cast member for several episodes. (Regardless of whether the tweets changed that season\u2019s story line, it was the main focus of the reunion episode.) \nNow, as Becca Kufrin\u2019s season of \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d picks up steam, a very similar situation with one of her suitors has cropped up online. At almost the same time, TMZ published the ultimate receipts: blurry but real photos of Ms. Kufrin taken, it looks like, after her engagement, snapped by a bystander. None of that noise has permeated the plotline of the show, but it has still satisfied fans\u2019 appetites for drama.\nThe \u201cReal Housewives,\u201d on the other hand, has evolved to a point where it\u2019s difficult to imagine what the onscreen drama would look like without real-world receipts. On Season 9 of Atlanta, Kandi Burruss printed out copies of text messages to explain her part (or lack thereof) in an alleged potential dalliance with castmate Porsha Williams (\u201cUnless you got some receipts, I don\u2019t know,\u201d fellow cast member Cynthia Bailey says about the kerfuffle). And in Season 9 of New York, Luann de Lesseps wouldn\u2019t believe her then-fiance Tom D\u2019Agostino was stepping out on her until the aforementioned Ms. Frankel showed Ms. de Lesseps pictures of him kissing another woman. \u201cPlease don\u2019t let it be about Tom,\u201d Ms. de Lesseps said upon hearing Ms. Frankel had something bad to tell her, to which Ms. Frankel famously replied, \u201cIt\u2019s about Tom.\u201d \nReceipts do not always make things clearer. Instead, they can complicate or extend a story\u2019s life. That\u2019s particularly true now that fans, not just tabloids and websites, have gotten involved in sleuthing. Soon after the popular \u201cHousewives\u201d podcast Bitch Sesh debuted, its Facebook fan page (now defunct) became a place for enthusiasts of all things \u201cHousewives\u201d to gather. The phrase \u201cboots on the ground\u201d was often used by the hosts to preface any gossip they\u2019d heard about the Housewives. Some of their listeners took that a bit too literally. As often happens in ostensibly utopian communities, the mood got dark fast. Splinter Facebook groups started to form, including one called the Thunderdome.\nMembers of the Thunderdome began to act like vigilante reporters, attempting to sleuth out gossip about their favorite and least favorite Housewives. In the fall of 2016, Kelly Dodd and Tamra Judge, stars of \u201cThe Real Housewives of Orange County,\u201d became a fixation. During the call-in portion of an episode of \u201cWatch What Happens Live!\u201d, Ms. Dodd answered a call from a Thunderdome member who had misrepresented the question she was going to ask to the production assistants, a move that was allegedly encouraged by Ms. Judge.  The caller asked about a man Ms. Dodd had supposedly cheated on her husband with \u2014 information that the caller had gotten from texts Ms. Dodd had sent that had been posted online without her knowledge. \u201cDidn\u2019t have an affair with Frank,\u201d Ms. Dodd said to the caller, as a confused Mr. Cohen looked on. \u201cDon\u2019t know where you\u2019re alluding to, you\u2019re alluding to texts that you got from some wackjob.\u201d\nThings got messier as Ms. Judge and Ms. Dodd hurled accusations against each other on social media. Facebook fan pages were shut down, and subreddits and online communities devoted to the Housewives stated that they would not allow people to speak overly negatively about members of the groups or cast members. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely disappointing that grown adults are capable of such pathetic acts and do so with their full names and photos posted right with it on Facebook,\u201d a moderator for the Reddit page BravoRealHousewives wrote (with an obscenity). \u201cThey are overall a nasty group hungry for information and what little power they think it gives them.\u201d\nThe drama was big enough that there was no way it wouldn\u2019t be included on Orange County, though if the fans that had involved themselves in it thought they would be a part of the story explicitly, they were mistaken. In Season 12 of Orange County, we learned that Ms. Judge and Ms. Dodd had not stopped warring \u2014 on social media and on camera \u2014 since the intense fan-encouraged exchange. But the details were kept out of it.\n\u201cThe social media stuff that happened between me and Tamra was absolutely obnoxious,\u201d Ms. Dodd said in an interview on the show. The camera then cut to her and Mr. Judge sitting down over lunch to discuss their issues.\n\u201cI think you\u2019re a lot like me, where I\u2019m over things,\u201d Ms. Judge said to Ms. Dodd. They then apologized to each other, and went on to joke about the size of their respective vaginas and struggles with incontinence.\nThere is one constant in the world of receipts: The possessor of the receipts is trying to gain power in a universe in which they rarely have any. We see the producers\u2019 hands are forced when they allude to what\u2019s happening behind the scenes in order to get a plot to make sense, creating an even more porous relationship between what\u2019s inside and what\u2019s outside the reality TV bubble. In this respect, receipts have become key to making good reality television, an integral part of the fabric of the medium\u2019s lexicon.\nThat does not mean what we\u2019re watching is any more true than it used to be. Often there are so many receipts it can be hard to tell what is hard evidence and what is smoke and mirrors. \u201cEveryone in this clique is so concerned with \u2018receipts,\u2019\u201d Ms. Parks said after the Season 9 Atlanta reunion, to which she had brought the ultimate receipts: her divorce papers. \u201cAs a licensed attorney, I wanted to make sure I came prepared with documents to back up the facts.\u201d\nMs. Parks soon found that after seven seasons, her contract to remain a Real Housewife was not renewed. In the court of reality television, there is rarely a receipt that will save you.", "date": "June 25, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/25/style/show-me-the-receipts.html", "tags": "controls show season produces \u201d cast receipts narrative housewives ms. reality"}
