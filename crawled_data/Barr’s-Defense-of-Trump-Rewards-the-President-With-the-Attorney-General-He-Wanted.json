{"title": "Barr\u2019s Defense of Trump Rewards the President With the Attorney General He Wanted", "content": "For 21 minutes on Thursday morning, with the nation watching, President Trump had the loyal attorney general he had always longed for.\nReading a prepared statement and then answering questions from reporters, Attorney General William P. Barr presented the special counsel\u2019s report, 90 minutes before its public release, in the best possible light for the president: No conspiracy. No obstruction. A sincerely frustrated and angered president who had willingly cooperated with investigators. No intention on the part of Robert S. Mueller III to have Congress make the hard call on whether Mr. Trump might have broken the law.\nAt one point, Mr. Barr quoted Mr. Mueller as telling him that the Justice Department\u2019s longstanding opinion that a sitting president could not be indicted was not the reason he had not pursued an obstruction charge against Mr. Trump. But when the report was released, it showed that Mr. Mueller had very much considered the Justice Department\u2019s position to be a complication if not an impediment to any charging decision.\nIt was less a performance of the nation\u2019s chief law enforcement officer than that of a defense lawyer for Mr. Trump, citing selective facts to build a case for exoneration and sidestepping elements of the report less favorable to the president. It enraged Democrats, drew heated and substantive rebuttals, and validated the fears of Mr. Barr\u2019s critics that he would bring his expansive view of presidential privilege to a norm-shattering presidency.\nMr. Barr made good on several promises: He released the confidential report to Congress and the American public. While the Justice Department redacted parts of the report for legal and intelligence reasons, it still provided a detailed and wide-ranging account of what Mr. Mueller found in his nearly two-year investigation and his reasoning for coming to the conclusions he did.\nBut those details put the conduct of Mr. Trump and his advisers in a far less flattering light than either Mr. Barr\u2019s terse news conference or his summary of the report\u2019s findings to congressional leaders last month.\nMr. Barr\u2019s presentation of the report was \u201ca masterful public relations job,\u201d said Matt Jacobs, a partner at Vinson & Elkins who worked as a federal prosecutor in San Francisco when Mr. Mueller ran that office and left the Justice Department in 2004. \u201cHe read every inference, and then some, in favor of the president.\u201d\n\u201cOn a matter of such national significance and historical significance,\u201d Mr. Jacobs said, \u201cone might have hoped that the attorney general would take a more neutral approach.\u201d\nMr. Barr is Mr. Trump\u2019s third attorney general, following Jeff Sessions, who lost the president\u2019s confidence early on when he recused himself from the Russia investigation, and Matthew G. Whitaker, who held the job in an acting capacity for three and a half months until Mr. Barr was confirmed in February.\nIt is Mr. Barr\u2019s second stint in the job \u2014 he was also attorney general under President George Bush from 1991 to 1993 \u2014 and he has increasingly shown signs of heeding Mr. Trump\u2019s demand to have a team player in the role. Last week, Mr. Barr said he would scrutinize the F.B.I.\u2019s investigation of the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia, including whether \u201cspying\u201d conducted by American intelligence agencies on the campaign\u2019s associates had been properly carried out.\nAmong the most striking examples of the gap between Mr. Barr\u2019s presentation on Thursday and the Mueller report itself came on the question of whether Mr. Trump might have obstructed justice.\nMr. Barr emphasized that he and the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, had concluded \u201cthat the evidence developed by the special counsel is not sufficient to establish that the president committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.\u201d\nMr. Barr said that Mr. Mueller had told him that \u201che had not made the determination that there was a crime\u201d when it came to obstruction of justice, and that his reasoning for that outcome was not dependent on a longstanding Justice Department position that a sitting president cannot be indicted.\nBut Mr. Mueller\u2019s report framed the issue differently. The report made clear that Mr. Mueller and his team believed it would be unfair to accuse Mr. Trump of obstruction when he would not be able to stand trial while in office and have an opportunity to clear his name. And the report specifically stated that the lack of a decision to accuse Mr. Trump of obstruction did not amount to clearing him.\n\u201cIf we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the president clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state,\u201d Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigators wrote. \u201cBased on the facts and the applicable legal standards, however, we are unable to reach that judgment.\u201d\nMr. Mueller specifically left open the possibility that Congress could be an appropriate venue in which to judge a president\u2019s conduct.\nMr. Mueller opposed Mr. Barr\u2019s long-held view that a president\u2019s use of his constitutional powers in the course of his official duties cannot constitute obstruction.\n\u201cThe conclusion that Congress may apply the obstruction laws to the president\u2019s corrupt exercise of the powers of office accords with our constitutional system of checks and balances and the principle that no person is above the law,\u201d the report said.\nMr. Barr asserted that the \u201cWhite House cooperated fully\u201d with Mr. Mueller, although Mr. Trump declined to meet with the special counsel\u2019s team, sought to have Mr. Mueller fired and oversaw an administration that repeatedly made inaccurate public statements about the investigation.\nThe special counsel called Mr. Trump\u2019s written answers to questions \u201cinadequate,\u201d largely because he often gave imprecise and incomplete responses. The report said the president did not agree to provide any answers to questions about obstruction or certain events during the presidential transition.\nFive times on Thursday, Mr. Barr noted that Mr. Mueller\u2019s report did not find evidence of a conspiracy between Russia and the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election.\nBut Mr. Mueller concluded that both sides saw mutual interests, with Russia believing it would benefit if Mr. Trump won the election and the Trump campaign expecting \u201cto benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts.\u201d\nMr. Barr expressed sympathy for the situation faced by the president, suggesting that Mr. Trump\u2019s frustration with the toll the investigation was taking on his presidency, rather than any corrupt intent, explained his actions. At times, Mr. Barr even adopted Mr. Trump\u2019s language, suggesting that he was not off base in claiming to be the victim of witch hunt.\n\u201cThere was relentless speculation in the news media about the president\u2019s personal culpability,\u201d Mr. Barr told reporters on Thursday. \u201cYet, as he said from the beginning, there was in fact no collusion.\u201d\nWhen Mr. Trump nominated Mr. Barr as attorney general in December, some viewed his age, 68, and establishment pedigree as signs that he would act independently in his handling of the Russia investigation.\nHaving already served once as attorney general, they said, Mr. Barr would be more concerned with protecting his own reputation than the president\u2019s.\nBut based on his views of executive power and his conservative social and political ideology, it was not entirely a surprise that Mr. Barr would side with Mr. Trump against those who argued that he broke the law in his efforts to undermine Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation of his campaign\u2019s ties to Russia.\nHe had made those views clear last June in a 19-page memo he wrote as a private citizen for the Justice Department, in which he castigated Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation for \u201cproposing an unprecedented expansion of obstruction laws\u201d that he said could have \u201cgrave consequences\u201d for the presidency.\nThat memo, which critics have characterized as a kind of audition tape to serve as a replacement for his ousted predecessor, Mr. Sessions, turned out to be an accurate road map to Mr. Barr\u2019s handling of the Mueller report. He acknowledged on Thursday that he disagreed with Mr. Mueller on several legal theories on potential obstruction.\nMr. Barr\u2019s untrammeled view of executive power goes back to the Bush administration, when he counseled Mr. Bush that he had the right to start a major war in the Persian Gulf without the authorization of Congress. Mr. Bush, more cautious than his deputy attorney general at the time, asked Congress for a vote to support the war.\n\u201cBill Barr is arguably going back to his worst instincts,\u201d said Laurence H. Tribe, a professor at Harvard Law School and an outspoken critic of Mr. Trump. \u201cHe is bending over backward to serve as an advocate for the president and the presidency.\u201d", "date": "April 18, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/18/us/politics/william-barr-robert-mueller-donald-trump.html", "tags": "wanted defense report president \u201d trump attorney barr general obstruction rewards mueller"}
