{"title": "Disney Drops PewDiePie and YouTube Distances Itself After Reports of Anti-Semitic Videos", "content": "The Disney-owned Maker Studios and YouTube have pulled away from PewDiePie, one of the video platform\u2019s most popular stars, after a report that he had posted several videos featuring anti-Semitic imagery.\nMaker Studios said on Monday that it had severed ties with the star, Felix Kjellberg, a Swede better known by his YouTube alias PewDiePie, while YouTube said on Tuesday that it had canceled the release of a coming series and dropped him from a premier advertising program.\nThe announcements came after The Wall Street Journal reported that Mr. Kjellberg had posted nine anti-Semitic videos since August.\n\u201cAlthough Felix has created a following by being provocative and irreverent, he clearly went too far in this case, and the resulting videos are inappropriate,\u2019\u2019 a Maker Studios spokeswoman said in a statement on Monday. \u201cMaker Studios has made the decision to end our affiliation with him going forward.\u201d\nOn Tuesday, a YouTube spokeswoman said the service was canceling the release of \u201cScare PewDiePie Season 2,\u201d a sequel to an original YouTube series, and dropping PewDiePie from Google Preferred, a program that offers advertisers access to its most popular channels.\nWith 53 million subscribers, Mr. Kjellberg has amassed one of the largest audiences on YouTube by posting clips of himself playing and talking about video games accompanied by humorous commentary.\nAccording to Social Blade, which compiles data on social media, PewDiePie is the most popular user on YouTube. His videos have attracted nearly 14.7 billion views.\nIn December, Forbes magazine estimated that Mr. Kjellberg had earned $15 million in the year that ended last June, thanks largely to his book, \u201cThis Book Loves You,\u201d and his series on YouTube Red, Google\u2019s paid subscription service, which offers ad-free viewing among other benefits.\nOne of the videos identified by The Journal featured a man dressed as Jesus Christ saying, \u201cHitler did absolutely nothing wrong.\u201d In another, Mr. Kjellberg hired two men to make and display a sign that said, \u201cDeath to All Jews,\u201d according to The Journal.\nPewDiePie removed those videos, along with a third, but not before they had amassed about 23 million views, The Journal reported. All three were published last month.\nMr. Kjellberg addressed the criticism in a Sunday post on Tumblr, the popular blogging platform.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to say something, and I want to make one thing clear: I am in no way supporting any kind of hateful attitudes,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cThough this was not my intention, I understand that these jokes were ultimately offensive.\u201d\nMr. Kjellberg did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment on Monday night.\nThe Walt Disney Company zealously defends its brand \u2014 it decided not to bid for Twitter last year in part because it was concerned with trolls on that social network \u2014 but this is not the first time that the entertainment conglomerate has had trouble from off-brand units. In 2010, for example, it sold the sometimes-racy Miramax Films.\nIn 2014, Disney paid $500 million for Maker Studios in a bid to expand its reach online. In the intervening years, however, Maker Studios has suffered from layoffs and retrenchments.", "date": "Feb. 14, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/business/pewdiepie-youtube-disney.html", "tags": "anti-semitic drops mr. youtube pewdiepie videos reports distances studios maker kjellberg disney"}
