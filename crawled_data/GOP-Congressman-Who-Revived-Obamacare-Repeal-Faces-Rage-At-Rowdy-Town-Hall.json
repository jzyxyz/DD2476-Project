{"title": "GOP Congressman Who Revived Obamacare Repeal Faces Rage At Rowdy Town Hall", "content": "WILLINGBORO, N.J. \u2015 Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.), who helped revive efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, on Wednesday became the latest Republican lawmaker to face angry voters at a town hall, just days after he voted for a House bill that would make sweeping changes to the nation\u2019s health care system.\nAppearing at a community center in a Democratic pocket of his New Jersey district, MacArthur fielded questions for nearly five hours from a loud and feisty crowd about his role in crafting the GOP health care bill and its effect on the insurance marketplace. A few constituents also demanded that he call for a special prosecutor to investigate whether President Donald Trump\u2019s aides colluded with Russia during the presidential campaign.\nThroughout, MacArthur defended the so-called American Health Care Act over boos and jeers from constituents, many of whom charged that the congressman would have blood on his hands if the bill becomes law. Several times during the event, MacArthur struggled to retain control of the room, getting shouted down even as he told the story of the 1996 death of his 11-year-old daughter, who was born with special needs.\n\u201cI\u2019m asking you guys to have some respect,\u201d he pleaded exasperatedly at one point.\n\u201cCan I be disrespectful on behalf of all the people you\u2019re gonna kill?\u201d responded one constituent who was angry over the health care vote.\u00a0\nLast month, MacArthur authored an amendment that helped bring a substantial number of House conservatives on board to the GOP health care bill, leading to its eventual passage last week. The provisions of the so-called MacArthur amendment would allow states to waive essential benefits such as maternity care and emergency room visits. It would also allow states to opt out of Obamacare\u2019s community rating rules, which require that insurers charge the same price to consumers in a certain area regardless of gender or pre-existing condition.\n\u201cIt was dead in the water until you revived it,\u201d said Derek Reichenbecher, 38, who has a heart condition. \u201cThis is my life. Without health care coverage, I\u2019m dead. I\u2019m dead.\u201d\nThe bill passed the House, 217 to 213, with all Democrats and 20 Republicans voting against it, and is now in the Senate\u2019s hands.\u00a0\nIn another exchange, MacArthur cast his role in helping craft the bill as not allowing perfect be the enemy of the good \u2015 arguing that members of Congress don\u2019t always \u201cvote on the bill they wish was in front of them.\u201d But the line failed to quell his constituents, who booed and shouted him down once more.\n\u201cYou submitted it! You were an architect!\u201d one person yelled, referring to his amendment.\nMacArthur repeatedly insisted that no one with pre-existing conditions will be declined coverage or priced out of being able to buy coverage under the GOP health care bill. He argued that moving people with pre-existing conditions out of the private insurance system and into high-risk pools would preserve the status quo.\n\u201cWhen people are in the risk pools, then everyone else\u2019s insurance [premium] comes down,\u201d he said.\n\u201cHow do you know without a CBO score?\u201d shouted a member of the crowd, referring to House\u2019s rush to pass the bill before the Congressional Budget Office could evaluate its costs and effects.\nMacArthur repeatedly declined to give a yes or no answer in two separate exchanges on whether the GOP health care bill classifies rape as a pre-existing condition.\n\u201cYou cannot be charged more or denied coverage. I will not reduce [rape] to calling it a pre-existing condition,\u201d he told a high school student. \u201cMy amendment doesn\u2019t do that.\u201d\nWhen a constituent called the GOP health care bill a giveaway to the wealthiest Americans, who stand to receive $594 billion in tax cuts over 10 years, MacArthur pushed back by claiming that all Americans would receive a tax cut under the plan.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t tax cuts for the rich. This is tax cuts for everyone,\u201d he said.\nAside from health care, which dominated much of the discussion, voters at the town hall appeared to be concerned about the president\u2019s decision to fire FBI Director James Comey. They urged MacArthur and other Republicans to stand up to the president and call for an independent investigation into Comey\u2019s ouster and the Trump campaign\u2019s possible ties to Russia.\n\u201cA special prosecutor is appointed by the president\u2019s attorney general. I don\u2019t see that as some silver bullet,\u201d MacArthur said, adding he wanted to give the House and Senate Intelligence committees an opportunity to investigate the matter.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t oversee the executive,\u201d he added, earning a round of loud boos from the audience. \u201cCongress is not the board of directors of the White House.\u201d\nOutside the building, dozens of people gathered to protest MacArthur and the health care bill. They carried signs that read, \u201cKiller Tom,\u201d \u201cHealth care, not wealth care,\u201d and \u201cStop Twitler now\u201d \u2015 a reference to the president and his active Twitter account. A group of demonstrators also held a \u201cdie-in\u201d to protest the health care bill. They lay down on the ground and held up mock tombstones while someone dressed as the grim reaper stood over them.\nDespite the location, not everyone at the town hall was a Democrat.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s ludicrous. I can\u2019t believe in this country we\u2019re going to ignore health care for people,\u201d Robert Gogats, a constituent of MacArthur\u2019s who identified himself as a registered Republican, told HuffPost.\nKim Hicks, another Republican who stood in line for the event, criticized MacArthur for presenting himself as a moderate member of the GOP.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not true at all,\u201d Hicks said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a cruel policy. The whole bill is cruel. There\u2019s no compassion in it. He\u2019s such a hypocrite. He\u2019s going to uninsure 24 million people.\u201d\nClarification: The description of the community center has been updated to better describe the building\u2019s function.", "date": "\n05/10/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/tom-macarthur-town-hall-obamacare_n_5913c749e4b030d4f1ef9c82", "tags": "congressman faces revived obamacare town repeal rowdy gop macarthur \u201d house bill rage hall care health"}
