{"title": "Cory Booker- Trump's Criticism Of Ilhan Omar Is 'Reprehensible'", "content": "Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) slammed President Donald Trump\u2019s attacks against Rep.\u00a0Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) as \u201ctoxic\u201d and \u201creprehensible\u201d during a forum on Wednesday for presidential candidates in Houston.\n\u201cThe criticisms of Congresswoman Omar, what Trump has been saying about her, is reprehensible,\u201d Booker said at the forum organized by She The People, a national network of women of color in politics.\u00a0\u201cIt is trafficking in Islamophobia, and should be condemned by everyone.\u201d\u00a0\nOmar, a black woman and one of the nation\u2019s first Muslim congresswomen, has come under repeated attack\u00a0from the president, pundits and lawmakers since she made statements questioning the U.S.\u2019s relationship with Israel.\nIn mid-April, Trump tweeted\u00a0\u201cWE WILL NEVER FORGET\u201d while sharing a misleading video\u00a0that spliced together comments Omar made last month with footage of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.\nOmar said death threats against her had increased\u00a0after the president\u2019s tweet, with her office noting that many directly referenced the video Trump had shared.\u00a0\nDespite this, Trump has continued his assault on Omar, tweeting that people should look at her \u201canti-Semitic, anti-Israel and ungrateful U.S. HATE statements\u201d and her \u201ccontrol\u201d of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). \n\u201cThe kind of language this president uses, especially about black women in power, is toxic,\u201d Booker said Wednesday. Trump has publicly attacked other high-profile black women in the past, such as Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.).\nBooker said Trump\u2019s language \u201cfuels the kind of hate\u201d behind terror attacks in the U.S., which he noted were largely perpetrated by\u00a0members of far-right groups, including\u00a0white supremacists. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not enough to say, \u2018I\u2019m not a racist,\u2019\u201d Booker added. \u201cWe must all be anti-racist.\u201d \u00a0\nBooker was the first of eight 2020 candidates to speak at an event billed as the nation\u2019s first-ever presidential forum focused on female voters of color. \nOther candidates included Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.); as well as former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro. \nThe forum was held at historically black Texas Southern University, with 1,700 people, largely women of color, in attendance, organizers said.\nRev. Leah Daughtry, who is black, kicked off the forum Wednesday by reminding the candidates that \u201cour votes matter.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWe consistently go to the polls \u2026 we carry this nation on our backs, and our votes matter,\u201d she said. She added that women of color want elected officials \u201cwho fight for us,\u201d and ticked off issues like access to health care, equal pay, criminal justice reform, a just immigration system, affordable housing and good schools with teachers who are paid fairly.\n\u201cYou can overlook us \u2026 if you want to,\u201d Daughtry said. \u201cBut you do it at your own peril.\u201d \nAt the event, Booker repeated a pledge he\u2019d alluded to earlier in his campaign: \u201cI will have a woman running mate,\u201d he said.
