{"title": "Trump Overrules Own Experts on Sanctions, in Favor to North Korea", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump undercut his own Treasury Department on Friday with a sudden announcement that he had rolled back newly imposed North Korea sanctions, appearing to overrule national security experts as a favor to Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader.\nThe move, announced on Twitter, was a remarkable display of dissension within the Trump administration. It created confusion at the highest levels of the federal government, just as the president\u2019s aides were seeking to pressure North Korea into returning to negotiations over dismantling its nuclear weapons program.\n\u201cIt was announced today by the U.S. Treasury that additional large scale Sanctions would be added to those already existing Sanctions on North Korea,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted. \u201cI have today ordered the withdrawal of those additional Sanctions!\u201d\nThe Treasury Department announced new sanctions on Friday against Iran and Venezuela, but not North Korea.\nHowever, economic penalties were imposed on Thursday on two Chinese shipping companies suspected of helping North Korea evade international sanctions. Those penalties, announced with news releases and a White House briefing, were the first imposed against North Korea since late last year and came less than a month after a summit meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim collapsed in Hanoi, Vietnam, without a deal.\nIt was initially believed that Mr. Trump had confused the day that the North Korea sanctions were announced, and officials said they were caught off guard by the president\u2019s tweet. Asked for clarification, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, declined to give specifics.\n\u201cPresident Trump likes Chairman Kim, and he doesn\u2019t think these sanctions will be necessary,\u201d she said.\nHours later, two officials familiar with Mr. Trump\u2019s thinking said the president was actually referring to additional North Korea sanctions that are under consideration but not yet formally issued.\nThat statement sought to soften the blow that Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet had dealt to his most loyal aides. Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, personally signed off on the sanctions that were issued on Thursday and hailed the decision in an accompanying statement.\n\u201cThe United States and our like-minded partners remain committed to achieving the final, fully verified denuclearization of North Korea,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said in the statement. He described the sanctions as part of an international campaign against North Korea that \u201cis crucial to a successful outcome.\u201d\nSanctions are one of America\u2019s most powerful tools for pressuring rogue nations. Mr. Mnuchin has taken great pride in bolstering Treasury\u2019s sanctions capacity and often says that he spends half of his time working on sanctions matters.\nTony Sayegh, a Treasury Department spokesman, referred questions about Friday\u2019s sanctions confusion to the White House.\nJohn R. Bolton, the president\u2019s national security adviser, had also hailed the earlier action against North Korea in a tweet on Thursday: \u201cEveryone should take notice and review their own activities to ensure they are not involved in North Korea\u2019s sanctions evasion.\u201d\nMr. Trump has been eager to strike a deal for North Korea to surrender its nuclear weapons arsenal and, in turn, hand him a signature foreign policy achievement that has eluded his predecessors. Hawks in the administration, such as Mr. Bolton, have been wary of trusting Mr. Kim despite Mr. Trump\u2019s professed strong personal connection to the North Korean leader.\nLast month, Mr. Trump was criticized for defending Mr. Kim over the death of Otto F. Warmbier, an American college student who died in 2017 after being imprisoned in North Korea. Mr. Trump said he believed Mr. Kim\u2019s claim that he was not aware of Mr. Warmbier\u2019s medical condition.\nBut in recent weeks there have been increasing signs that the thawing relations between the two countries could again turn frosty.\nThis month, a vice foreign minister of North Korea, Choe Son-hui, accused Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Mr. Bolton of creating an \u201catmosphere of hostility and mistrust\u201d despite the chemistry between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim.\nIn another sign of hardening on Friday, North Korea withdrew its staff from the joint liaison office it has operated with South Korea since September. The office was viewed as a potential first step toward the Koreas establishing diplomatic missions in each other\u2019s capitals. But North Korea has expressed frustration with how South Korea has been handling its role as a mediator with the United States.\nThe talks between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim broke down because North Korea wanted the United States to roll back some of its most economically painful sanctions without the North immediately dismantling its nuclear program.\nAs the linchpin of the global financial system, the United States relies on sanctions as one of its most powerful tools for international diplomacy. Officials at the Treasury and State Departments, including career staff members and political appointees, spend months carefully drafting sanctions based on intensive intelligence gathering and legal research.\nThe North Korea sanctions were no different, and the White House held a formal briefing on Thursday afternoon to explain the rationale behind the actions.\nDuring the briefing, senior administration officials pushed back on the idea that the sanctions sought to increase pressure on North Korea. Instead, they said, the new measures were meant to maintain the strength of existing sanctions.\nBut one of the senior administration officials strongly rebutted any suggestion that the administration would ease some sanctions as confidence building, or in return for smaller steps by North Korea.\n\u201cIt would be a mistake to interpret the policy as being one of a step by step approach, where we release some sanctions in return for piecemeal steps toward denuclearization\u201d said the administration official, who spoke to reporters on the condition of anonymity. \u201cThat is not a winning formula and it is not the president\u2019s strategy.\u201d\nWhile it is not unusual for the White House to have comment and even final approval of major sanctions, both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have expressed doubts about Mr. Trump\u2019s ability to execute sanctions policy responsibly.\nIn 2017, Congress passed legislation imposing sanctions on Russia and limiting the president\u2019s authority to lift them. Under pressure from his own party, Mr. Trump reluctantly signed the bill.\nThe reversal on the North Korea sanctions drew swift condemnation on Friday from Democrats, who accused the president of being reckless with national security.\n\u201cCareer experts at the Treasury Department undertake a painstaking process before imposing sanctions,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee. \u201cFor Donald Trump to overturn their decision via tweet because he has an inexplicable fondness for one of the world\u2019s most brutal dictators is appalling.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cWithout a well-conceived diplomatic strategy, Trump is simply undermining our national security by making clear that the United States is not a trusted foreign policy partner.\u201d\nSome Republicans also pushed back against the president, with Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado saying that North Korea sanctions should be imposed. \u201cStrategic Patience failed,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cDon\u2019t repeat it.\u201d\nMr. Trump\u2019s decision stunned current and former Treasury Department officials, some of whom wondered if the move was planned in advance as a gesture to Mr. Kim. Others feared that America\u2019s vaunted sanctions regime had been compromised.\n\u201cFor an administration that continues to surprise, this is another first \u2014 the president of the United States undercutting his own sanctions agency for imposing sanctions on Chinese actors supporting North Korea,\u201d said John E. Smith, the former director of the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, who left the department last year. \u201cIt\u2019s a win for North Korea and China and a loss for U.S. credibility.\u201d\nSarah Bloom Raskin, who was deputy Treasury secretary under President Barack Obama, said the sudden backtracking on a decision that would normally be made with comment from intelligence agencies and the National Security Council was perplexing.\n\u201cReversing sanctions decisions within hours of making the announcement that you would impose them in the first place is a head-spinner,\u201d she said. \u201cThis reversal signals the injection of some peripheral consideration or factor that only the president seems to know about and that may have nothing to do with national security.\u201d\nThe Trump administration did issue some new sanctions on Friday. The Treasury Department announced sanctions against Iran, targeting a research and development unit that it believes could be used to restart the country\u2019s nuclear weapons program. It also imposed sanctions on Bandes, Venezuela\u2019s national development bank, and its subsidiaries, as part of its effort to topple the government of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.", "date": "March 22, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/22/world/asia/north-korea-sanctions.html", "tags": "sanctions treasury \u201d trump experts north overrules favor korea"}
