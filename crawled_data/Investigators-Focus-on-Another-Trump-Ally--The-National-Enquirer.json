{"title": "Investigators Focus on Another Trump Ally: The National Enquirer", "content": "President Trump has long had ties to the nation\u2019s major media players. But his connections with the country\u2019s largest tabloid publisher, American Media Inc., run deeper than most.\nA former top executive of Mr. Trump\u2019s casino business sits on A.M.I.\u2019s four-member board of directors, and an adviser joined the media company after the election. The company\u2019s chairman, David J. Pecker, is a close friend of the president\u2019s.\nAnd in the Trump era, A.M.I.\u2019s flagship tabloid, The National Enquirer, has taken a decidedly political turn, regularly devoting covers to the president\u2019s triumphs and travails with articles headlined \u201cTrump\u2019s Plan For World Peace!\u201d and \u201cProof! FBI Plot to Impeach Trump!\u201d\nSince the early stages of his campaign in 2015, Mr. Trump, his lawyer Michael D. Cohen and Mr. Pecker have strategized about protecting him and lashing out at his political enemies.\nNow the tabloid company has been drawn into a sweeping federal investigation of Mr. Cohen\u2019s activities, including efforts to head off potentially damaging stories about Mr. Trump during his run for the White House. In one instance, The Enquirer bought but did not publish a story about an alleged extramarital relationship years earlier with the presidential candidate, an unusual decision for a scandal sheet.\nThe federal inquiry could pose serious legal implications for the president and his campaign committee. It also presents thorny questions about A.M.I.\u2019s First Amendment protections, and whether its record in supporting Mr. Trump somehow opens the door to scrutiny usually reserved for political organizations.\nA search warrant federal prosecutors in New York served to Mr. Cohen this week requests, among other things, all communications between him, Mr. Pecker and Dylan Howard, the business\u2019s chief content officer. The company was in touch with Mr. Cohen, The New York Times previously reported, as it pursued its deal to acquire the rights to a former Playboy model\u2019s story about an affair with Mr. Trump.\nThe company is also facing a Federal Election Commission complaint claiming that the $150,000 payment to the woman, Karen McDougal, represented an illegal campaign contribution. A.M.I. is in the process of responding.\nA.M.I. has denied any wrongdoing while also saying its cooperation with investigators will not extend beyond its constitutionally protected status as a news organization.\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to look down at the work product of celebrity magazines and assume they are not entitled to the same protections as the mainstream media,\u201d said Cameron Stracher, a lawyer for A.M.I. \u201cBut the First Amendment was designed to protect all speech against government intrusion.\u201d\nIn A.M.I., Mr. Trump has had an unusually powerful media backer, one that complements the supportive prime-time slate at Fox News.\nThe Enquirer had an average paid circulation of about 260,000 copies weekly in the second half of last year. That was a 13 percent drop from the previous six-month average, according to publisher data provided to the Alliance for Audited Media that was obtained by The Times.\nBut most of its sales come over the counter at $4.99 a copy. The Enquirer provides a useful platform for a politician seeking votes from average Americans, in a place candidates have gone to show their familiarity with everyday life: the supermarket checkout lane.\nThe family that controlled A.M.I. before Mr. Pecker took it over in 1999, the Popes, moved early on to secure prime placement for The Enquirer in magazine racks at grocery store cash registers. The company now also owns The Globe, Us Weekly, OK! and other titles that benefit from that arrangement.\nIn a statement, the company said, \u201cIf A.M.I. was \u2018helpful\u2019 to the president during the campaign, it was because the audience of The National Enquirer was one of the most supportive of his candidacy during the campaign.\u201d It added that Enquirer covers featuring Mr. Trump increased sales.\n\u201cWe covered him for a business reason,\u201d the statement said.\nMr. Pecker, a Bronx native who has reveled in upsetting the Manhattan magazine establishment since the early 1990s, has been open about his view that A.M.I. has good reason to connect itself to Mr. Trump. As he told The New Yorker last year, he considered an attack on Mr. Trump an attack on A.M.I. \u2014 implying they were one and the same.\nHe said that after A.M.I. bought Ms. McDougal\u2019s story and agreed to feature her in health and fitness columns in non-gossip magazines like Hers and Flex, it expected her loyalty to the company and Mr. Trump. \u201cOnce she\u2019s part of the company, then on the outside she can\u2019t be bashing Trump and American Media,\u201d he said.\nMr. Pecker has been supportive of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential aspirations since his run as a Reform Party candidate in 2000, when George magazine \u2014 part of the company Mr. Pecker ran then, Hachette \u2014 featured a friendly profile. The Enquirer was early to promote Mr. Trump\u2019s potential bid in 2011.\nAs Mr. Trump ramped up his campaign in 2015, he, Mr. Cohen, Mr. Howard and Mr. Pecker engaged in more serious discussions about how A.M.I. could be helpful, according to several people familiar with the efforts.\nIn one early interaction, Mr. Cohen helped arrange an ultimately abandoned attempt to buy and bury a potentially damaging photograph of Mr. Trump at an event with a topless woman \u2014 what is known in the tabloid world as a \u201ccatch and kill\u201d operation.\nOne person close to the campaign at the time recalled a meeting at Trump Tower in February 2015 between Mr. Pecker and Mr. Trump about how A.M.I. could help surface embarrassing information about Bill and Hillary Clinton, his Democratic rival, during a general election. The person, who requested anonymity to discuss private matters, said Mr. Cohen was also present. Mr. Cohen did not respond to a request for comment.\nLate Wednesday, A.M.I. said in a statement, \u201cIf the suggestion is that David, Trump and Cohen met to discuss Clinton strategy, A.M.I. categorically denies it.\u201d\nThere are several intersections between Mr. Trump\u2019s world and Mr. Pecker\u2019s. The former casino executive, David R. Hughes, joined A.M.I.\u2019s board in 2013, when he was the chief financial officer of Trump Entertainment Resorts (he is no longer a Trump employee). After the 2016 campaign ended, a media adviser, Justin McConney, landed at A.M.I. as its audience development director (he has since left).\nOne of A.M.I.\u2019s top financiers, the billionaire Leon G. Cooperman, was critical of Mr. Trump during the campaign but has more recently compared him favorably to Ronald Reagan. Last July, he accompanied Mr. Pecker to a White House dinner with Mr. Trump, along with another A.M.I. financial backer, Anthony Melchiorre, of Chatham Asset Management.\nAt the center of the campaign finance inquiries will be whether the ties between Mr. Cohen, Mr. Howard, Mr. Pecker, Mr. Trump and others led A.M.I. to act more like a political supporter than a news organization.\nThe group that brought the federal election complaint, Common Cause, claims the payment for Ms. McDougal\u2019s story was not a \u201clegitimate press function\u201d and therefore was not protected by rules exempting news organizations from campaign finance regulations.\nThe question represents tricky terrain for federal officials, given the protection journalists have under the First Amendment. \u201cWe always worry when investigators are making those judgment calls about whether your editorial process is legitimate or not, or is this legitimate journalism or not,\u201d said Alexandra Ellerbeck, the North America program coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists.\nYet even the staunchest defenders of the press say fraudulent activity is not protected by journalistic freedoms.\n\u201cWe are not, as media organizations, immune from the civil and criminal laws of the country,\u201d said Sandra S. Baron, a senior fellow at Yale Law School and the former executive director of the Media Law Resource Center.", "date": "April 11, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/11/us/politics/trump-national-enquirer-american-media.html", "tags": "company media enquirer pecker \u201d trump cohen focus ally another investigators national a.m.i campaign"}
