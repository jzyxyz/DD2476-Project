{"title": "Rep- Ilhan Omar Spars With Elliott Abrams Over His Links To War Crimes", "content": "Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) homed in on Elliott Abrams\u2019 dubious past when the controversial diplomat testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday. Abrams is now the special envoy to Venezuela, appointed by President Donald Trump in January.\nOmar \u2015 who is embroiled in her own controversy over tweets viewed by some as anti-Semitic (she \u201cunequivocally\u201d apologized on Monday) \u2015 questioned how Abrams, who has a history of lying to Congress and abetting war crimes by U.S. allies, could be trusted at all.\n\u201cI fail to understand why members of this committee or the American people should find any testimony that you give today to be truthful,\u201d Omar told Abrams.\nThe diplomat tried to defend himself against Omar\u2019s remarks, but the congresswoman cut him off. \u201cThat was not a question,\u201d she assured Abrams.\n\u201cIt was an attack,\u201d he replied.\nAbrams is a neoconservative who previously served in the administrations of President Ronald Reagan and President George H.W. Bush. In 1991, he\u00a0pleaded guilty to two counts of withholding information from Congress in the Iran-Contra scandal, which involved secret government operations including the promotion of arms sales to Iran and efforts to fund terrorist militia in Nicaragua.\nAbrams was sentenced to two years\u2019 probation and then pardoned in 1992 by the outgoing President Bush.\u00a0\nDespite Abrams\u2019 rebuke on Wednesday, Omar kept pushing the diplomat to address his past. She highlighted the 1981 El Mozote massacre in El Salvador, which occurred while Abrams was serving in Reagan\u2019s State Department. U.S.-trained Salvadoran troops murdered an estimated 800 civilians in the village, including families and children as young as 8 months old, according to a New York Times report\u00a0from 1982 and a Washington Post report from 1993.\u00a0But Abrams had dismissed early reports about the horror as \u201cnot credible.\u201d\u00a0\nOmar pointed out that Abrams once referred to the Reagan administration\u2019s policy on El Salvador as \u201cone of fabulous achievement\u201d \u2015 something he said in 1993.\n\u201cYes or no: Do you still think so?\u201d Omar asked.\n\u201cFrom the day that President Duarte was elected in a free election to this day, El Salvador has been a democracy. That\u2019s a fabulous achievement,\u201d Abrams replied, referring to former President Jos\u00e9 Napole\u00f3n Duarte who was elected in 1984.\u00a0\nOmar then narrowed her question: \u201cYes or no: Do you think that massacre was a \u2018fabulous achievement\u2019 that happened under our watch?\u201d\nOffended by what he called a \u201cridiculous question,\u201d Abrams refused to answer it. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr. Chairman, I am not going to respond to that kind of personal attack,\u201d he said.\u00a0\nAbrams continued to criticize Omar as she prodded him with more critical questions. At one point, she asked him if he would support an \u201carmed faction within Venezuela\u201d committing crimes against humanity or genocide \u201cif you believed they were serving U.S. interests, as you did in Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua?\u201d\nShe asked him if as the U.S. special envoy, he would try to ensure that human rights were upheld in Venezuela.\u00a0\n\u201cThe answer is that the entire thrust of American policy in Venezuela is to support the Venezuelan people\u2019s effort to restore democracy to their country,\u201d the diplomat answered. \u201cThat\u2019s our policy.\u201d\nAbrams\u2019 hearing was disrupted by three protesters from the anti-war advocacy group Code Pink.\u00a0Ariel Gold, the group\u2019s co-director, said she was arrested after yelling that Abrams was a \u201cwar criminal.\u201d", "date": "\n02/13/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ilhan-omar-elliot-abrams-clash-war-crimes_n_5c6480e6e4b0018ed01b5501", "tags": "crimes el venezuela abrams spars salvador omar \u201d \u2015 elliott links war ilhan diplomat rep-"}
