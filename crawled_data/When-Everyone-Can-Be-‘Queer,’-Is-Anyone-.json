{"title": "When Everyone Can Be \u2018Queer,\u2019 Is Anyone?", "content": "Earlier this year, Vice published an essay that posed the question \u201cCan Straight People Be Queer?\u201d The article includes an image from Jaden Smith\u2019s Facebook page of the musician looking petulant in a skirt, alongside the caption \u201cMy mood when they try to hate.\u201d It also makes reference to the model Lily Rose Depp, who once compared sexuality to dietary habits: \u201cYou could think peanut butter is your favorite food for, 5,000 years and then be like, \u2018I actually like burgers better,\u2019 you know?\u201d Vice, unsurprisingly, never settled on an answer, but a reader captured the article\u2019s sentiment in a succinct and sarcastic comment, writing, \u201cQueer is SO HOT right now.\u201d\nThe speed with which modern society has adapted to accommodate the world\u2019s vast spectrum of gender and sexual identities may be the most important cultural metamorphosis of our time. Facebook, which can be seen as a kind of social census, now offers nearly 60 different gender options, including \u201cquestioning\u201d and \u201cbigender\u201d \u2014 or no gender at all. In a new commercial for Calvin Klein, Young Thug, a slender rapper prone to wearing dresses, states that he feels \u201cthere\u2019s no such thing as gender.\u201d The Oxford English Dictionary recently added Mx, a neutral replacement for titles like Mr. and Mrs. The video game \u201cThe Sims\u201d has even begun allowing players to create same-sex relationships and lifted gender restrictions on characters\u2019 clothing and hairstyles. Plainly, we are in the midst of a profoundly exhilarating revolution. And \u201cqueer\u201d has come to serve as a linguistic catchall for this broadening spectrum of identities, so much so that people who consider themselves straight, but reject heteronormativity, might even call themselves queer. But when everyone can be queer, is anyone?\nThe word \u201cqueer\u201d has always contained the shimmer of multitudes; even etymologists can\u2019t settle on one origin story. One popular theory is that it descends from quer, an old German word meaning oblique \u2014 neither parallel nor at a right angle, but in between. From birth, queer has resisted straightness. By the 1800s, this inscrutability had taken on a negative cast in English usage, and queer marked something as dubious or unseemly: \u201cQueering the pitch\u201d meant to spoil something \u2014 a business transaction, say; being on \u201cqueer street\u201d meant financial ruin. Eventually, the word came to apply to people with ambiguous peculiarities. A \u201cqueer fellow,\u201d in 19th-century English, is decidedly odd, as is someone who is \u201cqueer in the head.\u201d\nThe word became linked to sexual behavior in the early 1900s, as a derogatory term for men deemed effeminate and others who upended traditional gender roles and appearances. As homosexuality was classified as a mental illness and made punishable by law, the word snowballed into a full-blown slur, heard everywhere from the playground (\u201csmear the queer\u201d) to intellectual duels (William F. Buckley Jr. to Gore Vidal: \u201cNow listen, you queer\u201d).\nThis halo of negativity began to dim somewhat in the 1970s, when the word was reclaimed by activists and academics. Not only did its deliberate looseness make it a welcome alternative to the rigidity of \u201cgay\u201d and \u201clesbian,\u201d it also turned the alienating force of the slur into a point of pride. (Though it is still considered offensive by some.) A manifesto distributed at New York City\u2019s Pride parade in 1990 by Queer Nation, a prominent and controversial gay-rights group, put it this way: \u201cWhen a lot of lesbians and gay men wake up in the morning, we feel angry and disgusted, not gay. So we\u2019ve chosen to call ourselves queer. Using \u2018queer\u2019 is a way of reminding us how we are perceived by the rest of the world.\u201d It was a radical word for a radical time. Protesters and advocacy groups \u2014 particularly communities of color \u2014 took it up to gather support for the fight against the AIDS crisis and for gay rights. \u201cWe\u2019re here, we\u2019re queer, get used to it\u201d became a popular chant.\nAcademics saw queerness as possessing revolutionary potential. Eve Sedgwick, a professor at Duke who is considered one of the founders of queer theory, described queerness as an \u201copen mesh of possibilities.\u201d David Halperin, a founder of an academic journal on queer studies, describes queerness as a practice, one that is an \u201cexhilarating personal experiment, performed on ourselves by ourselves.\u201d Writing in 1995, Halperin bemoaned the dilution of what he felt was a subversive word. \u201cThere is now a right way to be queer ... to invert the norms of straight society,\u201d he scoffed, referring to clothes, haircuts, piercings, even diets tailored to gay and lesbian buyers. \u201cHow can queer modes of consumption count as resistant cultural practices?\u201d Eight years later, the hit makeover show \u201cQueer Eye for the Straight Guy\u201d debuted on Bravo, literalizing Halperin\u2019s concerns. Each episode culminated in a lavish shopping trip that distilled gay culture down to clothes and hair products \u2014 and it was all done in the service of straight men.\nIncreased acceptance of queerness has only led to increased commodification. Every June, the month of most gay-pride celebrations, companies like Netflix, McDonald\u2019s, Apple, Salesforce and Walmart spend tremendous amounts of money to include their branded floats in the parades. This year, Andrew Joliv\u00e9tte, a professor at San Francisco State University, told The Guardian that the city\u2019s event was no longer a symbol of progress. Instead, he said, it felt like a prolonged commercial: \u201cGay Inc.\u201d In the same article, Isa Noyola, a transgender Latina activist in San Francisco, remarked on the paradox that the same companies championing gay rights have contributed to the gentrification that has made the Castro one of the most expensive neighborhoods in the country. \u201cIt\u2019s ironic to walk alongside tech companies that have displaced us,\u201d she said.\nThe radical power of \u201cqueer\u201d always came from its inclusivity. But that inclusivity offers a false promise of equality that does not translate to the lived reality of most queer people. Anti-trans bathroom laws and the shooting at Pulse, the gay nightclub in Orlando, are the latest reminders that equality has yet to arrive. Seen this way, such a sunny outlook can, in fact, be counterproductive. DarkMatter, a South Asian trans performance-art duo, highlights this observation \u2014 the way visibility and acceptance can actually lead to erasure \u2014 in their works. In one, called \u201cRainbows Are Just Refracted White Light,\u201d they intone, \u201cRainbows are just a trick of light, they make us forget the storm is still happening.\u201d\nMaybe we are relying on a single word, a single idea, a single identity, to do too much. After all, \u201cqueer\u201d never belonged to us; it was foisted upon us, and we reconfigured it to make it ours. The future will bring new possibilities and ideas \u2014 and new terms for them. Scientists are still learning about the vast and complex components that interact to create human sexuality. An article in Nature from 2015 delved into the latest research on sex and gender among mice. Sex determination is thought to happen in the womb, but studies of mice suggest that sex can fluctuate between male and female throughout life. Someday, maybe we\u2019ll recognize that queer is actually the norm, and the notion of static sexual identities will be seen as austere and reductive.\nTo the queer theorist Jos\u00e9 Esteban Mu\u00f1oz, queerness was not a label people could claim but a complete reimagining of how people could be. \u201cWe may never touch queerness,\u201d he wrote, in his 2009 book, \u201cCruising Utopia.\u201d \u201cBut we can feel it as the warm illumination of a horizon imbued with potentiality.\u201d The widespread acceptance and even appropriation of the word \u201cqueer\u201d seem to move us both closer to and further from such a future. But the horizon is out there, and you can see it if you squint.", "date": "July 12, 2016", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/17/magazine/when-everyone-can-be-queer-is-anyone.html", "tags": "us \u2018 word gender everyone queer \u201d one anyone \u2014 gay"}
