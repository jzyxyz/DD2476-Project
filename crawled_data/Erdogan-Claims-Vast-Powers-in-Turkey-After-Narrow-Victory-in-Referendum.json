{"title": "Erdogan Claims Vast Powers in Turkey After Narrow Victory in Referendum", "content": "ISTANBUL \u2014 A slim majority of Turkish voters agreed on Sunday to grant sweeping powers to their president, in a watershed moment that the country\u2019s opposition fears may cement a system of authoritarian rule within one of the critical power brokers of the Middle East.\nWith nearly 99 percent of votes in a referendum counted on Sunday night, supporters of the proposal had 51.3 percent of votes cast, and opponents had 48.7 percent, the country\u2019s electoral commission announced.\nThe result will take days to confirm, and the main opposition party said it would demand a recount of about 37 percent of ballot boxes, containing around 2.5 million votes.\nBut on Sunday night the result was already a political reality, as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan hailed his victory in front of a crowd of supporters in Istanbul. \u201cWe are enacting the most important governmental reform of our history,\u201d he said.\nThe constitutional change will allow the winner of the 2019 presidential election to assume full control of the government, ending the current parliamentary political system.\nThe ramifications, however, are immediate. The \u201cyes\u201d vote in the referendum is a validation of the current leadership style of Mr. Erdogan, who has been acting as a de facto head of government since his election in 2014 despite having no constitutional right to wield such power. The office of Turkey\u2019s president was meant to be an impartial role without full executive authority.\nThe result tightens Mr. Erdogan\u2019s grip on the country, which is one of the leading external actors in the Syrian civil war, a major way station along the migration routes to Europe and a crucial Middle Eastern partner of the United States and Russia.\nMany analysts were surprised by the close result, saying they had expected Mr. Erdogan to achieve a larger majority because he had held the referendum within an atmosphere of fear.\nSince a failed coup last summer, Turkey has been under a state of emergency, a situation that allowed the government to fire or suspend about 130,000 people suspected of being connected to the failed putsch, and to arrest about 45,000.\nThe campaign itself was characterized by prolonged intimidation of opposition members, several of whom were shot at or beaten while on the stump by persons unknown.\nThe opposition questioned the legitimacy of the referendum after the election board made a last-minute decision to increase the burden needed to prove accusations of ballot-box stuffing. At least three instances of alleged voter fraud appeared to be captured on camera.\n\u201cWe are receiving thousands of complaints on election fraud,\u201d said Erdal Aksunger, the deputy head of the main opposition party, the Republican People\u2019s Party, known as the C.H.P. \u201cWe are evaluating them one by one.\u201d\nThe new system will, among other changes:\n\u25a0 Abolish the post of prime minister and transfer executive power to the president.\n\u25a0 Allow the newly empowered president to issue decrees and appoint many judges and officials responsible for scrutinizing his decisions.\n\u25a0 Limit the president to two five-year terms, but give the option of running for a third term if Parliament truncates the second one by calling for early elections.\n\u25a0 Allow the president to order disciplinary inquiries into any of Turkey\u2019s 3.5 million civil servants, according to an analysis by the head of the Turkish Bar Association.\nAcademics and members of the opposition are concerned that the new system will threaten the separation of powers on which liberal democracies have traditionally depended.\n\u201cIt represents a remarkable aggrandizement of Erdogan\u2019s personal power and quite possibly a death blow to vital checks and balances in the country,\u201d said Professor Howard Eissenstat, a Turkey expert at the Project on Middle East Democracy, a Washington research group. \u201cJudicial independence was already shockingly weak before the referendum; the new system makes that worse.\u201d\nMr. Erdogan\u2019s supporters deny that the new system will limit political and judicial oversight. If opposition parties win control of Parliament, they could override the president\u2019s decrees with their own legislation, while also asserting greater control over judicial appointments, supporters of the new Constitution contend.\nThe victorious \u201cyes\u201d camp also argues that a strong, centralized government will make Turkey better able to tackle its many challenges, including a troubled economy, the world\u2019s largest population of Syrian refugees, two terrorism campaigns, a civil war against Kurdish insurgents and the Syrian war across Turkey\u2019s southern border.\n\u201cA new page opens in our history of democracy with this vote,\u201d Prime Minister Binali Yildirim, an Erdogan loyalist, said in a victory speech on Sunday night. \u201cBe sure, everyone, we will use this result as best as we can \u2014 for the wealth and peace of our people.\u201d\nThe fearful environment in which the referendum campaign was held has led watchdogs to question its fairness. In addition to the vast purges of perceived opposition members, the authorities also often prevented \u201cno\u201d campaigners from holding rallies and events. And Mr. Erdogan and his supporters often implied that their opponents were allied with terrorist groups or those suspected of plotting last year\u2019s failed coup.\nAnalyses of television coverage showed that the \u201cyes\u201d campaign received disproportionately more airtime than its opponents.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a completely unfair campaign,\u201d said Andrej Hunko, a German lawmaker assigned by the Council of Europe to observe the election.\nHundreds of election observers were also barred from monitoring the vote, and thousands of Kurds displaced by fighting in southeastern Turkey may not have been able to vote because they have no address, according to the Independent Election Monitoring Network, a Turkish watchdog.\nDespite this, Mr. Erdogan\u2019s victory fell far short of the 20-point majority that he and his supporters had expected. \u201cThis is a little bit bittersweet,\u201d said Cuneyt Deniz, an Erdogan supporter celebrating in Ankara. \u201cWe were expecting above 60 percent.\u201d\nThe result revealed a deeply divided country, nearly half of which now feels highly embittered. \u201cI am incredibly sad right now,\u201d said Yesim Kara, 37, a \u201cno\u201d voter in Istanbul. \u201cDark days are ahead.\u201d\nMr. Erdogan\u2019s victory \u201cwill enhance the stability of the government, but it will weaken social stability,\u201d said Ozgur Unluhisarcikli, the director of the Ankara office of the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a research group.\n\u201cThe new social contract that is being built in Turkey is being based on a very weak foundation,\u201d he added.\nFew could agree about how Mr. Erdogan would respond, and he offered no conclusive clues in his victory speech.\nIn one breath, he appeared to reach out to his opponents, calling the results the \u201cvictory of everyone who said yes and no.\u201d But in the next, he promised to reinstate the death penalty \u2014 which would end any hopes that Turkey will join the European Union \u2014 and mocked his opponents\u2019 intent to appeal the result.\n\u201cDon\u2019t beat the air,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is too late now.\u201d\nSome believe Mr. Erdogan may initially try to rebuild relations with the West, which were severely damaged during the referendum campaign as he sought to manufacture diplomatic crises to energize his base at home.\nAfter Germany and the Netherlands blocked Turkish officials from campaigning in those countries, Mr. Erdogan said both nations had shown Nazi-like behavior, drawing a rebuke from leaders like Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.\nMr. Unluhisarcikli said he expected a victorious Mr. Erdogan to lead \u201ca charm offensive toward Europe and the U.S. to gain validation of the new system \u2014 and such a charm offensive might include correcting some of the democratic backsliding that we\u2019ve seen in Turkey.\u201d\n\u201cOn the other hand, if his charm offensive is not reciprocated,\u201d Mr. Unluhisarcikli added, \u201cthen he might start initiating a Plan B, which involves tightening his grip on Turkish society.\u201d\nBut Professor Eissenstat said it was unlikely Mr. Erdogan would spend any time repairing relationships with the opposition.\n\u201cSome people have imagined that Erdogan might reboot after a \u2018yes\u2019 victory and reach out to the opposition,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that is likely. The purges will continue; Erdogan\u2019s instinct is to crush opposition, not co-opt it.\n\u201cThe question is whether further centralization of power and increased repression can bring stability and allow Erdogan to reboot a troubled economy,\u201d added Professor Eissenstat, a lecturer at St. Lawrence University. \u201cThe record of the past 10 years is that the opposite is true.\u201d\nMr. Yildirim, the prime minister, suggested in his speech that the government was unlikely to step back from its various vendettas at home and abroad. \u201cOur struggle with internal and external enemies will be intensified,\u201d he said.", "date": "April 16, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/16/world/europe/turkey-referendum-polls-erdogan.html", "tags": "turkey erdogan mr. powers opposition victory claims new \u201d system referendum narrow vast"}
