{"title": "Donald Trump Falsely Claims Tax Bill Means 'We Have Essentially Repealed Obamacare'", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2015 President Donald Trump on Wednesday heralded Republicans\u2019 tax bill for its provision repealing the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate by incorrectly asserting that the health care law as a whole had been repealed.\u00a0\n\u201cWhen the individual mandate is being repealed, that means Obamacare is being repealed,\u201d Trump said at a Cabinet meeting that seemed to double as his airing of grievances before the holidays. \u201cWe have essentially repealed Obamacare, and we will come up with something much better.\u201d\u00a0\nThis is demonstrably false. The law still remains, after Republicans\u2019 failed efforts to repeal it earlier this year. Republicans have devised ways to fundamentally weaken Obamacare\u2019s provisions because they have not yet figured out how to repeal it outright, as\u00a0HuffPost\u2019s Jonathan Cohn reported.\u00a0\nGOP lawmakers added the elimination of the individual mandate\u00a0to the tax bill, partly as a concession to some Republicans who had held out supporting the bill and partly as a way to offset the economic costs of it.\nRepealing the individual mandate will worsen insurance markets, but the tax bill does not affect other important structures of the Affordable Care Act, such as protections for people with pre-existing conditions, tax credits for people who buy their own insurance and the expansion of state Medicaid programs. And Obamacare enrollment continued this year, despite the Trump administration\u2019s attempts to undermine the program.\nThe president said Wednesday that he did not want the media discussing his claim about the health care law.\n\u201cObamacare has been repealed in this bill,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to bring it up. I told people specifically, \u2018Be quiet with the fake news media,\u2019 because I don\u2019t want them talking too much about it.\u201d", "date": "\n12/20/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-obamacare-repeal_n_5a3a9cebe4b06d1621b13adc", "tags": "individual mandate tax obamacare repealed claims means essentially republicans trump donald bill falsely care"}
