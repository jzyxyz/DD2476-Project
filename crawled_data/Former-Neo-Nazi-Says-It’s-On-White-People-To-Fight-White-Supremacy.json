{"title": "Former Neo-Nazi Says It\u2019s On White People To Fight White Supremacy", "content": "As a 14-year-old in 1980s Chicago, Christian Picciolini was ripe for recruitment into a hate group: He was bullied, didn\u2019t have a lot of friends and felt \u201cabandoned\u201d by his Italian immigrant parents who worked long hours.\nOne day, when he was standing in an alley smoking a joint, a car pulled up, and a man with a shaved head came out, pulled the joint out of his mouth and said:\n\u201cDon\u2019t you know that\u2019s what the Jews and the Communists want you to do to keep you docile?\u201d \nThat man was Clark Martell, a national leader of the white supremacist skinhead movement. Martell\u2019s history of violence, according to a 1989 Chicago Tribune article, included targeting LGBTQ people and people of color. He once attempted to burn down the house of a Latino family.\nPicciolini was recruited into Martell\u2019s neo-Nazi skinhead group in 1987, and when Martell ended up in prison a couple of years later, Picciolini took the helm.\n\u201cHe made me feel powerful when I felt powerless, gave me family and a sense of purpose,\u201d Picciolini told HuffPost. \u201cI was a nobody kid people picked on for having a funny name \u2015 and [a few years later] I was respected and powerful.\u201d \n\u201cFalse power and false respect,\u201d Picciolini added.\nAfter having children, which Picciolini says challenged his \u201cnotions of identity, community and purpose,\u201d\u00a0he left the hate group in 1995.\nOver a decade later, in 2009, he co-founded\u00a0Life After Hate, a small nonprofit run entirely by former members of America\u2019s radical far-right, dedicated to supporting those who have left, or are seeking to leave, hate groups in the U.S.\nIt\u2019s the only organization of its kind in the country \u2015 and it\u2019s up against a growing problem: The number of hate groups in the U.S. has doubled in the last 10 to 15 years, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, and around 80 percent of those groups advocate white supremacist beliefs.\nLeaving a hate group isn\u2019t easy. When a woman left his neo-Nazi group in 1989, Martell viciously beat her, according to the Tribune. He reportedly kicked her in the face and drew a swastika on the wall of her home in her blood. He was later arrested and sent to prison.\nLife After Hate helps those who have left or are trying to leave extremism behind by providing them with an array of support services. The main tool of the Chicago-based group is a private online network, set up by and for former extremists, to provide them with a new, supportive community.\n\u201cPeople come to us because they know that we won\u2019t judge them,\u201d Picciolini told HuffPost. \u201cAs someone who understands their past, we give them a helping hand \u2015 not focused on yesterday, but focused on today and tomorrow.\u201d\nPicciolini and his colleagues \u2015 some of whom are social workers, all of whom are former extremists and have worked with psychologists to craft their nonprofit\u2019s approach \u2015 also travel the country to meet with members in person, to provide individualized support. They\u00a0help connect members to local service providers, including therapy, job training and tattoo removal, to try to tackle the underlying drivers of their hate.\nPicciolini says most people who come to them have experienced one of three things: trauma, unemployment or mental health issues.\n\u201cI listen for potholes \u2015 or what deviated them from their normal path and led them down this one \u2015 and try to find them services to help,\u201d Picciolini said. \u201cWhen you make people more resilient, self-sufficient and self-confident, they don\u2019t have anyone to blame, and the \u2018us against them\u2019 ideology goes away.\u201d\nPrivacy is paramount, so before they let anyone into their online group, they spend months chatting with them to make sure they\u2019ve truly left extremism.\n\u201cWe want to protect the people in the network,\u201d Picciolini said. \u201cIt\u2019s a safe place, not for someone vulnerable to going back \u2015 and taking names with them.\u201d\nLife After Hate\u2019s reach is relatively small: Its online group currently has 60 members. Some had already left extremism before they joined and were looking for community. Others are actively exiting hate groups.\nFor Picciolini, who recognizes their group is small compared with the problem of white supremacist hate, it\u2019s all about helping people one by one.\n\u201cWe reach one person at a time \u2015 we know we can\u2019t solve racism,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I do know is I can affect the people closest to me. If everybody thinks that way \u2015 with your coworkers, your friends \u2015 it can change the world.\u201d\nOne key strategy the group uses to help people leave extremism behind is to facilitate in-person meetings between former extremists and members of groups they once discriminated against \u2015 for instance, having a former Islamophobe meet an imam, or letting a onetime Holocaust denier talk with a survivor.\n\u201cAs former extremists from the far right, what changed us is when we received compassion from the people we least deserved it from,\u201d Picciolini said. \u201cOften times they\u2019ve never met a black person or had a meaningful conversation with a Muslim or Jewish person. I get them into a situation where they can sit and talk, and realize there are more things in common than differences.\u201d\nThe strategy derives from \u201ccontact theory,\u201d or the well-researched idea that contact with groups from different backgrounds can increase tolerance. It seems to have worked for certain high-profile extremists, such as\u00a0former white nationalist Derek Black,\u00a0who\u00a0began leaving the movement after being invited to a series of Shabbat dinners by a Jewish fellow college student, and Life After Hate Deputy Director Angela King, who left the skinhead movement after being befriended by a group of Jamaican women in prison.\n\u201cThat\u2019s how most people get out,\u201d expert Heidi Beirich of the Southern Poverty Law Center told HuffPost last month,\u00a0adding that\u00a0the work of reaching out to people\u00a0from different backgrounds should not fall on people from marginalized groups.\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be on the groups facing this,\u201d Beirich said. \u201cIt\u2019s on the rest of us.\u201d\nPart of the reason there aren\u2019t more groups like Life After Hate in the U.S. \u2015 while other forms of organized violence, such as\u00a0gangs\u00a0and\u00a0Islamist extremism,\u00a0have long had programs and funding dedicated to tackling them \u2015\u00a0is because Americans tend to ignore\u00a0the realities of white supremacist violence, according to Beirich.\n\u201cThere has been a general reluctance in this country to see white people as responsible for terrorism in some sort of organized way,\u201d Beirich told HuffPost last month. \u201cWhen people talk about white supremacist terrorism, they want to call it a one-off. He\u2019s a crazy person. It\u2019s like white people can\u2019t handle the idea that there are devils in our midst.\u201d\nSince September 11, 2001, there have been 85 deadly extremist attacks in the United States, according to a recent Government Accountability Office report \u2014 73 percent of the attacks were carried out by far-right extremist groups, compared to 27 percent by radical Islamist extremists.\nJust a couple of months ago, Reuters reported that the Trump administration may alter\u00a0the government\u2019s counter-extremism program to focus solely on Islamist extremism. As a result,\u00a0Life After Hate may lose $400,000 in funding that it had been awarded through the program in January under President Barack Obama, said Picciolini. The group hasn\u2019t received the funds yet and doesn\u2019t know if it will.\n\u201cWe\u2019re concerned about the policies of the new administration [indicating] that white extremism may not be an issue,\u201d Picciolini said. \u201cThere really is no difference between what happened in Charleston with Dylann Roof and what happened in San Bernardino.\u00a0They\u2019re both terror attacks based on ideologies of extremism\u00a0\u2015 yet we still don\u2019t call it terrorism when it\u2019s white extremism.\u201d\nPicciolini says that the recent rise of the\u00a0so-called alt-right movement\u00a0\u2015 a white supremacist movement with young leadership, branding meant to appeal to millennials and a large online presence \u2015 makes Life After Hate\u2019s job harder.\n\u201cIn the old days you could spot a skinhead a mile away \u2015 now it\u2019s harder in a virtual world. And they made the message more palatable, wear suits and ties, don\u2019t shave their heads.\n\u201cThe only difference between alt-right and what I was in then is packaging. It\u2019s a marketing strategy: They just soften the edges.\u201d\nSince President Donald Trump\u2019s election, Picciolini says, the number of requests that have come in to Life After Hate for support have grown\u00a0\u2015 from one to three requests per week to one to three per day. Most of these come from friends or family concerned that a loved one might be involved in extremism.\nIt is not clear how well exit programs like Life After Hate work. Older exit programs in Europe, such as those developed for white supremacists in Sweden in the 1990s, have been criticized at times for \u201cglorifying former extremists as \u2018experts\u2019\u201d and not eliminating participants\u2019 racism, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. \nBut experts who have weighed in on Life After Hate consider it a useful contribution to the larger fight against white supremacism.\n\u201cEverything always has to be considered part of a larger toolbox,\u201d Pete Simi, an author and expert on far-right extremists, said in an interview last year. \u201cThere\u2019s never any program that\u2019s ever going to be your catchall. But I think it is an important tool.\u201d\nSPLC\u2019s Beirich, who has been studying white supremacism since 1999, told HuffPost last month that she sees Life After Hate as a solution.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have anywhere to send a white supremacist if they come to me and start questioning the movement they\u2019re involved in,\u201d Beirich said. \u201cOnce you become a hard-core white supremacist, you lose all links to family and friends,\u00a0there isn\u2019t really a place for you to turn if you leave. I\u2019m not trying to give anyone a pass, but if someone wants to get out of something bad, I want to help.\u201d\nA Life After Hate member echoed the need for more groups like it.\n\u201cThere were years I was looking for a way out, and I didn\u2019t have anywhere to turn,\u201d former skinhead Logan Stewart told HuffPost. \u201cIt\u2019s\u00a0great support. Anything you need to talk about you can do that with them.\u201d\nFor Picciolini, if there\u2019s one thing that holds true when thinking of how to best tackle white supremacist hate, it\u2019s this:\u00a0The responsibility falls on white people.\n\u201cWhite people need to solve the problem of white supremacy,\u201d Picciolini said. \u201cIt\u2019s white people\u2019s problem, we created it, and it\u2019s a problem we need to fix.\u201d", "date": "\n04/24/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/life-after-hate-christian-picciolini-white-supremacist-exit-skinhead_n_58fa36cee4b018a9ce5ace1a", "tags": "people supremacy hate neo-nazi former white \u201d \u2015 one says picciolini group fight life"}
