{"title": "Justices Allow Execution of Muslim Death Row Inmate Who Sought Imam", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday allowed the execution of a Muslim inmate in Alabama whose request that his imam be present had been denied.\nThe vote was 5 to 4, with the four more liberal members of the court in dissent.\nThe majority offered little reasoning but said that the inmate, Domineque Ray, had waited too long to object. Justice Elena Kagan, writing for the dissenters, said the majority was \u201cprofoundly wrong.\u201d\nUnder Alabama\u2019s policy, she wrote, \u201ca Christian prisoner may have a minister of his own faith accompany him into the execution chamber to say his last rites.\u201d\n\u201cBut if an inmate practices a different religion \u2014 whether Islam, Judaism or any other \u2014 he may not die with a minister of his own faith by his side,\u201d Justice Kagan wrote.\n\u201cThat treatment goes against the Establishment Clause\u2019s core principle of denominational neutrality,\u201d she added, referring to the clause of the First Amendment that bars the government from favoring one religious denomination over another.\nA federal appeals court had issued a stay of execution on Wednesday, saying that excluding the imam while routinely allowing a Christian chaplain to be present raised serious questions about religious discrimination.\nMr. Ray was originally scheduled to be executed at 6 p.m. Thursday for the 1995 rape, robbery and murder of Tiffany Harville, 15, in a cotton field outside Selma. His lawyer, Spencer Hahn, said at 10:20 p.m. that Mr. Ray had been killed.\nAs his execution date neared, Mr. Ray told prison officials that he sought, as the appeals court put it, \u201cspiritual guidance and comfort from a cleric of his own faith.\u201d\nThe officials said Mr. Ray\u2019s imam could visit him shortly before the execution and observe it from a viewing room. But they would not allow the imam into the execution chamber.\nThe chaplain was allowed to be present, the officials went on, because he was an employee of the prison system who was \u201ca member of the execution team\u201d and was \u201cfamiliar with the technicalities of the execution protocol,\u201d having attended almost every execution in the state since 1997. The chaplain kneels and prays with inmates who seek pastoral care, the officials said. After considering Mr. Ray\u2019s request, prison officials agreed to exclude the chaplain. But they said allowing the imam to be present raised unacceptable safety concerns.\nA unanimous three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in Atlanta, stayed the execution, saying Mr. Ray had presented \u201ca powerful Establishment Clause claim.\u201d\n\u201cWe are exceedingly loath to substitute our judgment on prison procedures for the determination of those officials charged with the formidable task of running a prison, let alone administering the death penalty in a controlled and secured manner,\u201d Judge Stanley Marcus wrote. \u201cNevertheless, in the face of this limited record, it looks substantially likely to us that Alabama has run afoul of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.\u201d\nThe appeals court put Mr. Ray\u2019s appeal on a fast track, with briefing to have been completed in a little more than a month.\nOn Wednesday, lawyers for Alabama filed an emergency application asking the Supreme Court to vacate the stay of execution in the case, Dunn v. Ray, No. 18A815. The state should be allowed, they wrote, to proceed with the \u201cserious and solemn responsibility\u201d of conducting executions \u201cin an orderly and secure fashion.\u201d\nIn response, lawyers for Mr. Ray urged the justices to allow the litigation to move forward in the appeals court. \u201cMr. Ray does not dispute that the state has an interest in enforcing its judgments,\u201d they wrote. \u201cBut it does not have an interest in doing so unconstitutionally.\u201d\nIn her dissent on Thursday, Justice Kagan wrote that the majority had acted with unseemly haste.\n\u201cRay has put forward a powerful claim that his religious rights will be violated at the moment the state puts him to death,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe 11th Circuit wanted to hear that claim in full. Instead, this court short-circuits that ordinary process \u2014 and itself rejects the claim with little briefing and no argument \u2014 just so the state can meet its preferred execution date.\u201d", "date": "Feb. 7, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/us/politics/supreme-court-domineque-ray.html", "tags": "allow imam ray execution officials death court wrote \u201d muslim inmate justices row \u2014 sought"}
