{"title": "In Urban China, Cash Is Rapidly Becoming Obsolete", "content": "SHANGHAI \u2014 There is an audacious economic phenomenon happening in China.\nIt has nothing to do with debt, infrastructure spending or the other major economic topics du jour. It has to do with cash \u2014 specifically, how China is systematically and rapidly doing away with paper money and coins.\nAlmost everyone in major Chinese cities is using a smartphone to pay for just about everything. At restaurants, a waiter will ask if you want to use WeChat or Alipay \u2014 the two smartphone payment options \u2014 before bringing up cash as a third, remote possibility.\nJust as startling is how quickly the transition has happened. Only three years ago there would be no question at all, because everyone was still using cash.\n\u201cFrom a tech standpoint, this is probably one of the single most important innovations that has happened first in China, and at the moment it\u2019s only in China,\u201d said Richard Lim, managing director of venture capital firm GSR Ventures.\nThere are certain parts of the Chinese internet that have to be seen to be believed. Coming from outside the country, it\u2019s hard to comprehend that Facebook or Google can be completely blocked until you are forced to do without them. It\u2019s tough to fathom how critical the messenger app\u00a0WeChat is for everyday life\u00a0until the sixth person of the day asks to scan your\u00a0QR code\u00a0\u2014 a sort of bar code \u2014 to connect the two of you.\nWhat\u2019s happening with cash in China is similar. For the past three years, I have been outside mainland China covering Asian technology from Hong Kong, which has a very different internet culture from the mainland. I knew that smartphone payments were taking over in China, as the statistics were stark: In 2016, China\u2019s mobile payments\u00a0hit $5.5 trillion, roughly 50 times the size of America\u2019s $112 billion market, according to consulting firm iResearch.\nEven so, the attendant cultural shift was graspable only in person. I recently moved to Shanghai and felt the change with cash acutely because my first few weeks in the metropolis of more than 20 million were spent cut out of the system. Because of an issue with my bank, I couldn\u2019t immediately link my account to WeChat, which has become a virtual wallet for so many.\nThat meant I had to navigate China the way I would have three years ago: with a stack of red 100-renminbi notes.\nAt coffee shops and restaurants, I held up lines as I fumbled out my wallet and peeled off the bills to give the cashier. If I was hungry I had to go outside and find a restaurant, while bowls of noodles, groceries and coffee materialized at our office, ordered by my colleagues and paid for on the phone. If I had to get somewhere, I couldn\u2019t use my phone to unlock one of the ubiquitous bicycles that are a part of China\u2019s bike-sharing craze.\nEven the buskers were apparently ahead of me. Enterprising musicians playing on the streets of a number of Chinese cities have put up boards with QR codes so that passers-by can simply transfer them tips directly.\n\u201cIt has become the default way of life now,\u201d said Shiv Putcha,\u00a0an analyst with the research firm IDC. \u201cLiterally every business and brand in China is plugged into this ecosystem.\u201d\nSome Scandinavian countries have also weaned themselves from cash but still use cards frequently. In China, the change has been to phones.\u00a0One friend didn\u2019t realize how reliant she had become on mobile payments until her bank called her. She had left her A.T.M. card in the machine three weeks earlier and had not noticed its absence.\nIn practical terms, this means Tencent and Alibaba\u2019s financial affiliate, Ant Financial, the two Chinese internet companies that run WeChat and Alipay, respectively, are sitting atop a gold mine of staggering proportions. Both companies can make money off the transactions, charge other companies to use their payment platforms and all the while collect the payments data to be used in everything from new credit systems to advertising.\nMr. Lim said that according to recent data, Ant Financial and Tencent were set to surpass credit card companies like Visa and Mastercard in total global\u00a0transactions per day in the coming year. The key is that both companies are able to provide payments on the cheap,\u00a0partly\u00a0by allowing smaller vendors to make use of a simple printout of a QR code or their phone, instead of an expensive card reader. A back-end system that stores\u00a0a record of user accounts, instead of having to communicate with a bank, also keeps costs down.\nWhile Tencent does not break out what it makes from mobile payments, in the fourth quarter of 2016 the \u201cother services\u201d item in its earnings almost tripled from a year earlier to 6.4 billion renminbi, or $940 million, driven largely by mobile payments.\nThere are some potential future problems with China\u2019s sweeping embrace of online payments. As the country builds its entire consumer economy around two private smartphone payment platforms, it is slowly locking out people unable to get onto those networks, and locking itself into those companies.\nAt the simplest level, that makes life difficult for tourists and business travelers who are unlikely to open a bank account in China and so will find it hard to turn their phones into wallets.\nMore broadly, it means things could get harder for foreign and local businesses alike. Foreign companies hoping to sell to Chinese consumers now must deal with Alibaba and Tencent or risk being unable to take payments. Likewise, Chinese companies reliant on Alibaba and Tencent have to build out separate structures to deal with the world of Facebook, Google and credit cards that still dominate elsewhere.\nThere is a corollary for what could happen here. In Japan in the early 2000s, flip phones could do everything from stream cable TV to pay at stores. But because the phones were so advanced, Japan was slow to adopt smartphones, and it went from tech giant to tech laggard in 15 years.\nNow in Japan those flip phones, which are still being used, are called\u00a0Gal\u00e1pagos phones\u00a0because they evolved perfectly for an isolated environment.\nNo doubt aware of this, Alibaba and Tencent are pushing to expand beyond China to ensure their newest innovation doesn\u2019t go the way of the dinosaurs. Still, competition is most likely looming.\n\u201cThe million-dollar question is: Will Western firms decide to build a system and compete?\u201d Mr. Lim said. \u201cThe answer is probably yes.\u201d\nUntil then, new arrivals like me have to deal with being locked out of China\u2019s online payments infrastructure.\nEarlier this month, though, I lucked out using cash. As I was trying to get a pile of stuff from Ikea back to my new apartment, a cabdriver looked skeptically at the huge rolled-up mattress pad I was planning to load into the back of his car.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I can take you,\u201d he said to me. \u201cI can only take cash.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s all I have,\u201d I said to my fellow Luddite, who grumpily agreed to ferry me home.", "date": "July 16, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/16/business/china-cash-smartphone-payments.html", "tags": "urban china companies \u201d phones rapidly chinese cash becoming obsolete payments \u2014"}
