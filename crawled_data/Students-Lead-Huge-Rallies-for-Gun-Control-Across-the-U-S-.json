{"title": "Students Lead Huge Rallies for Gun Control Across the U.S.", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Standing before vast crowds from Washington to Los Angeles to Parkland, Fla., the speakers \u2014 nearly all of them students, some still in elementary school \u2014 delivered an anguished and defiant message: They are \u201cdone hiding\u201d from gun violence, and will \u201cstop at nothing\u201d to get politicians to finally prevent it.\nThe students, as they seized the nation\u2019s attention on Saturday with raised fists and tear-streaked faces, vowed that their grief about school shootings and their frustration with adults\u2019 inaction would power a new generation of political activism.\n\u201cIf they continue to ignore us, to only pretend to listen, then we will take action where it counts,\u201d Delaney Tarr, a student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, where a gunman killed 17 people last month, told tens of thousands rallying in Washington. \u201cWe will take action every day in every way until they simply cannot ignore us any more.\u201d\nFor many of the young people, the Washington rally, called March for Our Lives, was their first act of protest and the beginning of a political awakening. But that awakening may be a rude one \u2014 lawmakers in Congress have largely disregarded their pleas for action on television and social media in the five weeks since the Parkland shooting.\nThat reality helped drive the Parkland survivors in Washington, as they led a crowd that filled blocks of Pennsylvania Avenue between the White House and Capitol Hill. Thousands more rallied at about 800 \u201csibling\u201d marches around the country and abroad, where students, like those in the capital, made eloquent calls for gun control and pledged to exercise their newfound political power in the midterm elections this fall.\nAerial video captured seas of people \u2014 in front of Trump International Hotel in New York; in a central square in Tokyo; along the streets of Boston; at a rally in downtown Fort Worth, Tex.; and crammed into a park less than a mile from Stoneman Douglas High.\nDelivered in soaring speeches, emotional chants and hand-painted signs, the protesters\u2019 messages offered angry rebukes to the National Rifle Association and politicians who have left gun laws largely intact for decades. A sign in Washington declared \u201cGraduations, not funerals!\u201d while another in New York said \u201cI should be learning, not protesting.\u201d Crowds in Chicago chanted \u201cFear has no place in our schools\u201d as they marched.\nCelebrities, including Lin-Manuel Miranda, the \u201cHamilton\u201d star, and the pop singers Ariana Grande and Miley Cyrus, performed in Washington, where politicians and adult activists were largely sidelined in favor of the fresh-faced students offering stories of fear and frustration, but also hope for change.\nThe most powerful, and impassioned, moments came from the surviving students of the Parkland shooting, who declared themselves angry, impatient and determined to stop the slaughter.\n\u201cToday, we march,\u201d Ms. Tarr said. \u201cWe fight. We roar. We prepare our signs. We raise them high. We know what we want, we know how to get it and we are not waiting any more.\u201d\nAn 11-year-old girl from Virginia, Naomi Wadler, captivated her audience as she declared \u201cNever again!\u201d on behalf of black women and girls who have been the victims of gun violence.\nCalls like Naomi\u2019s stood in stark contrast to action on Capitol Hill and at the White House in the hours before the rallies. President Trump signed a $1.3 trillion spending bill that took no significant new steps on gun control: It did nothing to expand background checks, impose additional limits on assault weapons, require a higher age for rifle purchases or curb the sale of high-capacity ammunition magazines.\nThe spending legislation, which was viewed as the last opportunity this year for Congress to enact major new gun restrictions before the midterm elections in November, included only some school safety measures and modest improvements to the background check system.\nOrganizers at national gun control groups, who provided logistical support and public relations advice as the students planned the Washington rally, said they believed that the students would not become disillusioned by the lack of immediate action in Congress. They noted that rallies took place in 390 of the country\u2019s 435 congressional districts.\n\u201cThe mass shooting generation is nearing voting age,\u201d said John Feinblatt, the president of Everytown for Gun Safety, a national group that advocates tougher gun laws. \u201cThey know the midterms are six months away, and they plan to make sure that they vote and they get others to register to vote. They are absolutely poised to turn this moment into a movement.\u201d\nGun rights organizations largely stayed silent on Saturday, following vigorous efforts since the Parkland shooting to squash any movement toward significant gun control legislation. A spokesman for the N.R.A. declined repeated requests for comment.\nOn the eve of the march, Colion Noir, a host on NRATV, an online video channel produced by the gun group, lashed out at the Parkland students, saying that \u201cno one would know your names\u201d if someone with a weapon had stopped the gunman at their school.\n\u201cThese kids ought to be marching against their own hypocritical belief structures,\u201d he said in the video, adding: \u201cThe only reason we\u2019ve ever heard of them is because the guns didn\u2019t come soon enough.\u201d\nSmall counterprotests took place in a few cities. In Salt Lake City, several hundred people gathered near a high school, some carrying signs with messages like \u201cAR-15\u2019s EMPOWER the people.\u201d Brandon McKee, who wore a pistol on his belt, brought his daughter, Kendall, 11, who held a sign that said \u201cCriminals love gun control.\u201d\n\u201cI believe it\u2019s their goal to unarm America, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re here today,\u201d Mr. McKee said of the Washington marchers. In Boston, about 20 protesters favoring gun control confronted a small clutch of Second Amendment supporters in front of the State House. The two sides quickly got into a shouting match.\nThe pro-gun protests were swamped in size and enthusiasm by those marching for gun control, many of whom traveled for many hours to attend the rallies in cities across the country. Sebastian Jennings, 18, said he spent 36 hours taking a bus to Washington from western Arkansas. Tour buses lined the streets.\nSecurity was tight in Washington, where military trucks and guards blocked almost every intersection near the rally amid a huge police presence, and in other cities where marches and rallies forced the closing of major roads.\nIn towns like Dahlonega, Ga., smaller rallies sought to demonstrate a desire for new gun restrictions even in rural, Republican-leaning communities where gun ownership is common and support for the Second Amendment is strong.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be the generation that takes down the gun lobby,\u201d Marisa Pyle, 20, said through a red megaphone to a group of several hundred people gathered in front of the Dahlonega Gold Museum.\nAround the world, Americans living abroad gathered to honor those who have died in school shootings and to echo the call for gun control.\nProtesters in Rome jammed the sidewalk across from the American Embassy, next to the upscale Via Veneto, raising their voice in chants \u2014 \u201cHey hey, ho ho, the N.R.A. has got to go,\u201d and waving signs with messages like \u201cA gun is not fun\u201d and \u201cAm I next?\u201d many made by high school students at an international school.\nAbout 150 to 200 people in Berlin gathered in solidarity in front of the Brandenburg Gate, just steps from the American Embassy. Many carried hand-painted signs, among them: \u201cArms should be for hugging,\u201d \u201cBullets aren\u2019t school supplies\u201d and \u201cWaffeln statt Waffen\u201d (Waffles instead of weapons).\nOne of the largest rallies outside Washington was at a Florida park not far from Stoneman Douglas High School. During that event, 17 students from the school silently took the stage to represent their friends who had been killed.\nAnthony Montalto, the brother of Gina Rose Montalto, one of those killed, held a sign that said: \u201cMy sister could not make it here today. I\u2019m here for her.\u201d\n\u201cTurn this moment into a movement,\u201d Sari Kaufman, a sophomore at Stoneman Douglas, implored the sea of students, parents and teachers. She urged her classmates to vote out of office politicians who receive money from the N.R.A. \u201cThey think we\u2019re all talk and no action.\u201d\nBut the largest rally, by far, was in Washington, where stage risers and giant television monitors were set up in the shadow of the Capitol \u2014 the focus of much of the anger from students throughout the day.\nOne protester carried a sign that said \u201cIf the opposite of pro is con, then the opposite of progress is Congress.\u201d\nMost Republican and Democratic members of Congress had already left the city to return to their home districts for spring break. Mr. Trump spent Saturday afternoon in Florida, at the Trump International Golf Club, less than an hour north of Parkland. A White House spokeswoman said in a statement, \u201cWe applaud the many courageous young Americans exercising their First Amendment rights today.\u201d\nCity officials had prepared for the biggest march since about a half-million women gathered on the day after Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, declaring a new political movement aimed at resisting the president and his policies.\nOn Saturday, officials with Metro, the region\u2019s subway system, said more than 207,000 rides had been taken on the system by 1 p.m., about half of the number by that time during the Women\u2019s March.\nA team of crowd science researchers led by G. Keith Still of Manchester Metropolitan University in England estimated that about 180,000 people attended the rally. They examined photographs, video and satellite imagery to estimate the crowd density in different areas of the demonstration. The number is less than half of the 470,000 that Dr. Still estimated had attended the Women\u2019s March in Washington in 2017.\nEven so, the streets of Washington were packed on Saturday. Teenagers climbed on each other\u2019s shoulders to reach the bare limbs of trees, where they climbed higher. And each student who spoke drew a cheer that matched, and even eclipsed, the applause given to the musical performers.\nEdna Chavez, 17, a high school senior from Los Angeles, said she had lost her brother to gun violence: \u201cHe was in high school when he passed away. It was a day like any other day. Sunset down on South Central. You hear pops, thinking they\u2019re fireworks.\u201d\n\u201cRicardo was his name. Can you all say it with me?\u201d she asked. The crowd said his name over and over again, as Ms. Chavez smiled through tears.\nNaomi Wadler, the 11-year-old student, introduced herself with a soft \u201chi\u201d and said she represented the black women who have been victims of gun violence.\n\u201cPeople have said that I am too young to have these thoughts on my own,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople have said that I am a tool of some nameless adult. It\u2019s not true. My friends and I might still be 11, and we might still be in elementary school, but we know.\u201d\nShe added, \u201cAnd we know that we have seven short years until we, too, have the right to vote.\u201d", "date": "March 24, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/24/us/politics/students-lead-huge-rallies-for-gun-control-across-the-us.html", "tags": "washington control high rallies gun \u201d school lead u.s parkland students huge across"}
