We don\u2019t want them here,\u201d he said at a swearing-in ceremony at the Pentagon for Secretary of Defense James Mattis. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to admit into our country the very threats we are fighting overseas.\u201d\nIt\u2019s still not clear what\u2019s in the order, which the president signed on live television. But an earlier leaked draft suggested\u00a0the action would block refugee admissions from the war-torn country of Syria indefinitely; suspend refugee admissions from all countries for 120 days; and ban people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering the U.S. for 30 days.\n\u201cWe will never forget the lessons of 9/11, nor the heroes who lost their lives at the Pentagon,\u201d the president said Friday. \u201cThey were the best of us. We will honor them not only with our words but with our actions. I am privileged to be here with you, and I promise that our administration will always have your back.\u201d\nIf the document follows the leaked text, it would not be the blanket ban on Muslims that Trump advocated for during his campaign. But it targets solely Muslim-majority countries, and Trump said earlier in the day that he would prioritize helping Syrian Christians. Trump also mentioned \u201cradical Islamic terrorists\u201d while signing it.\nThis story has been updated to reflect that the document is an executive order.\nHow will Trump\u2019s first 100 days impact you?\u00a0Sign up\u00a0for our weekly newsletter and get breaking updates on Trump\u2019s presidency by\u00a0messaging us here.", "date": "\n01/27/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-muslims-immigration_n_588b9967e4b0b065cbbbc678", "tags": "\u2018 \u201c u-s- president signed radical trump days vetting says order terrorists new islamic said keep"}
