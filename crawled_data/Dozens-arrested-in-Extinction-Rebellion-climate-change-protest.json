We have to do all we can to bring this serious problem to the attention of the world, and if that means that I run the risk of being arrested and fined, then so be it.\"\nOn Monday, Extinction Rebellion Scotland dropped banners over Victoria Street in Edinburgh, from the Finnieston Crane, and across Glasgow's City Chambers. No-one was arrested.\nIn London, however, protests caused widespread disruption on Monday, and campaigners have now been ordered to restrict their protests to Marble Arch. \nThe Metropolitan Police said 500,000 people had been affected by the diversion of bus routes. \nBy 21:30BST on Tuesday 290 people had been arrested.
