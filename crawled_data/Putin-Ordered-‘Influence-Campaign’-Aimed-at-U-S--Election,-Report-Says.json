{"title": "Putin Ordered \u2018Influence Campaign\u2019 Aimed at U.S. Election, Report Says", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 American intelligence officials have concluded that the president of Russia, Vladimir V. Putin, personally \u201cordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election,\u201d and turned from seeking to \u201cdenigrate\u201d Hillary Clinton to developing \u201ca clear preference for President-elect Trump.\u201d\nThe conclusions were part of a declassified intelligence report, ordered by President Obama, that was released on Friday. Its main determinations were described to Mr. Trump by the nation\u2019s top intelligence officials earlier in the day, and he responded by acknowledging, for the first time, that Russia had sought to hack into the Democratic National Committee\u2019s computer systems. But he insisted that the effort had no effect on the election, and he said nothing about the conclusion that Mr. Putin, at some point last year, decided to aid his candidacy.\nThe report, a damning and surprisingly detailed account of Russia\u2019s efforts to undermine the American electoral system and Mrs. Clinton in particular, went on to assess that Mr. Putin had \u201caspired to help President-elect Trump\u2019s election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him.\u201d\nThe report described a broad campaign that included covert operations, including cyberactivities and \u201ctrolling\u201d on the internet of people who were viewed as opponents of Russia\u2019s effort. While it accused Russian intelligence agencies of obtaining and maintaining \u201caccess to elements of multiple U.S. state or local electoral boards,\u201d it concluded \u2014 as officials have publicly \u2014 that there was no evidence of tampering with the tallying of the vote on Nov. 8.\nBut the declassified report contained no information about how the agencies had collected their data or had come to their conclusions. So it is bound to be attacked by skeptics and by partisans of Mr. Trump, who see the review as a political effort to impugn the legitimacy of his election. Intelligence officials have rejected that view.\nThe report, reflecting the assessments of the C.I.A., the F.B.I. and the National Security Agency, stopped short of backing up Mr. Trump on his declaration that the hacking activity had no effect on the election. \u201cWe did not make an assessment of the impact that Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election,\u201d the report concluded, saying it was beyond its responsibility to analyze American \u201cpolitical processes\u201d or public opinion.\nThe intelligence agencies also concluded \u201cwith high confidence\u201d that Russia\u2019s main military intelligence unit, the G.R.U., created a \u201cpersona\u201d called Guccifer 2.0 and a website, DCLeaks.com, to release the emails of the Democratic National Committee and of the chairman of the Clinton campaign, John D. Podesta.\nWhen those disclosures received what was seen as insufficient attention, the report said, the G.R.U. \u201crelayed material it acquired from the D.N.C. and senior Democratic officials to WikiLeaks.\u201d The founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, has denied that Russia was the source of the emails it published.\nThe report makes clear that Mr. Putin favored Mr. Trump in part because he had previous success dealing with \u201cWestern political leaders whose business interests made them more disposed to deal with Russia\u201d \u2014 it named a former Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, as an example \u2014 and in part because he viewed Mr. Trump as a more likely ally in forming Russia\u2019s version of a counterterrorism coalition against the Islamic State. Mr. Trump described his eagerness to do so in an interview with The New York Times in March 2016.\nThe report also stated that Russia collected data \u201con some Republican-affiliated targets,\u201d but did not disclose the contents of whatever it harvested.\nThe report\u2019s introduction called the public document a summation of \u201ca highly classified assessment.\u201d The classified version, officials say, comes in two forms \u2014 one for Congress and another, called a \u201ccompartmentalized\u201d report, for select members of Congress and top officials of the incoming and outgoing governments.\nThe compartmentalized version contains information on the sources and methods used to collect the information about Mr. Putin and his associates. Those would include intercepts of conversations and the harvesting of computer data from \u201cimplants\u201d that the United States and its allies have put in Russian networks.\nThe conclusions were described to Mr. Obama on Thursday and to Mr. Trump on Friday by James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence; John O. Brennan, the director of the C.I.A.; Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency; and James B. Comey, the director of the F.B.I.\nThe key to the report\u2019s assessment is that Russia\u2019s motives \u201cevolved over the course of the campaign.\u201d When it appeared that Mrs. Clinton was more likely to win, it concluded, the Russian effort focused \u201con undermining her future presidency.\u201d It noted that Mr. Putin had a particular animus for Mrs. Clinton because he believed she had incited protests against him in 2011.\nYet the attacks, the report said, began long before anyone could have known that Mr. Trump, considered a dark horse, would win the Republican nomination. It said the attacks began as early as July 2015, when Russian intelligence operatives first gained access to the Democratic National Committee\u2019s networks. Russia maintained that access for 11 months, until \u201cat least June 2016,\u201d the report concludes, leaving open the possibility that Russian cyberattackers may have had access even after the firm CrowdStrike believed that it had kicked them off the networks.\nIntelligence officials who prepared the classified report on Russian hacking activity have concluded that British intelligence was among the first to raise an alarm that Moscow had hacked into the Democratic National Committee\u2019s computer servers, and alerted their American counterparts, according to two people familiar with the conclusions.\nMr. Trump was briefed by senior intelligence officials for nearly two hours on Friday, describing the briefing in a statement as \u201ca constructive meeting and conversation with the leaders of the intelligence community.\u201d\nIt is unclear whether they highlighted the British role, which has been closely held, in the briefing. But it is a critical part of the timeline, because it suggests that some of the first tipoffs, in fall 2015, came from voice intercepts, computer traffic or human sources outside the United States, as emails and other data from the D.N.C. flowed out of the country.\n\u201cThe British picked it up, and we may have had it at about the same time,\u201d said one cyberexpert who has been briefed on the findings. British intelligence \u2014 especially the signals intelligence unit, GCHQ \u2014 has a major role in tracking Russian activity.", "date": "Jan. 6, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/06/us/politics/russia-hack-report.html", "tags": "\u2018 election intelligence report officials russian u.s. \u201d aimed influence says ordered russia \u2014 campaign putin"}
