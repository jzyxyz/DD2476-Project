{"title": "Internet Users in China Expect to Be Tracked. Now, They Want Privacy.", "content": "SHANGHAI \u2014 China\u2019s biggest online payment company offers its hundreds of millions of users a breakdown on their spending each year, showing everything from their environmental impact to their ranking among shoppers in their area. Many spenders \u2014 not shy, and occasionally even a bit boastful about their personal finances \u2014 in turn share the details on social media.\nThis year, the marketing stunt has run into a problem: China\u2019s growing sense of personal privacy.\nAnt Financial, an affiliate of the e-commerce giant Alibaba Group, apologized to users on Thursday after prompting an outcry by automatically enrolling in its social credit program those who wanted to see the breakdown. The program, called Sesame Credit, tracks personal relationships and behavior patterns to help determine lending decisions.\nThat Sesame Credit program is part of a broader push in China to track how people go about their day, one that could feed into the Chinese government\u2019s ambitious \u2014 and, some people would say, Orwellian \u2014 effort to use technology to keep a closer watch on its citizens.\nThe episode was a rare, public rebuttal of a prevailing trend in China. The country\u2019s largest internet companies, and the government itself, have gathered ever more data on internet users. While Chinese culture does not emphasize personal privacy and Chinese internet users have grown accustomed to surveillance and censorship, the anger represents a nascent, but growing, demand for increased privacy and data protections online.\nFueled in part by widespread internet fraud and personal information theft, the call for privacy, if it continues, could become a major challenge to China\u2019s internet titans, and eventually to the cyber-authoritarian aspirations of the Chinese government itself.\nChina has long had high levels of surveillance, from ubiquitous closed-circuit cameras in its big cities to the monitoring of much of its citizens\u2019 online communications. But such efforts have proliferated as new technologies like facial recognition have begun to be rolled out and artificial intelligence has made crunching vast amounts of data much easier.\nFor now, it is far from clear that this rising discomfort will give way to policy changes. Many Chinese people, even as they express concerns about how companies use their data online, offer little criticism of Beijing\u2019s desire to use that data to help compile a broad social tracking system that rewards what it regards as good citizens and punishes others.\nStill, recent signs indicate Chinese consumers are beginning to express some of the same privacy concerns long found in the United States and elsewhere.\nThis week, one of China\u2019s most visible business leaders bemoaned what he said was a lack of privacy in China in general, and specifically on the country\u2019s most widely used mobile chat service, WeChat.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no privacy and information security these days,\u201d Li Shufu, the chairman of Geely Holding Group and Volvo Cars, said at a New Year\u2019s forum. \u201cWhen you walk on the road, there are surveillance cameras everywhere.\u201d\n\u201cPony Ma must be reading our WeChat messages every single day,\u201d he added, referring to the founder of Tencent, the Chinese internet giant that runs the social media and chat app, which has almost one billion users.\nIn a statement, Tencent said that the company did not store the chat history of users and that it would never use chat history for big data analytics. The comments were met with widespread disbelief: WeChat users have been arrested over what they\u2019ve said on the app, conversations have turned up as evidence in court proceedings, and activists have reported being followed based on WeChat conversations.\n\u201cIt has become a default setting for me now to assume that we have no privacy in the face of Alibaba and Tencent,\u201d said Li Luyao, a college student in Beijing.\nMr. Li said he did not believe Tencent\u2019s assurances that it was not storing chat logs, and he expressed anger at Ant Financial for resorting to what he called \u201cold tricks.\u201d\nIn its end-of-year feature, Ant Financial had customers click through a screen with a line in small font saying the user agreed to the terms of service, which were hidden. A toggle was on by default to indicate that the user agreed, and enrolled them in the Sesame Credit program.\nAnt Financial said in the terms of service that it reserved the right to share the data it collected with third parties \u2014 including government agencies assembling a state-sanctioned social credit system \u2014 and could not be held responsible for what happened after it shared the information.\nIn its statement, Ant Financial said users should have had to actively change the toggle to indicate they agreed, and added that it would remove all of those who had been inadvertently added to the credit system.\nUser complaints went beyond the narrow concern over how they joined, to broader questions regarding what they were asked to join.\n\u201cThe tone of the agreement makes me feel so uncomfortable because every sentence literally goes, \u2018If this happens, we are not responsible, if that happens, we are not responsible,\u2019\u201d said Zhou Yang, a 25-year old investment professional in Shanghai. \u201cThey sound like sneaky unscrupulous merchants who will sell your data and don\u2019t want to be responsible for anything, and you have to agree to all of it.\u201d\nMs. Zhou\u2019s fears about data sales underscore more widespread worries about controlling personal information. China\u2019s official media have reported an increasing number of cases of internet fraud, and personal data is widely available for sale through online marketplaces. A 2017 survey by China\u2019s state-run Beijing Youth Daily found that leaking personal data was the No. 1 concern among consumers.\nThe issue has filtered to the top of the Chinese leadership. Even as Beijing continues to assemble one of the most sophisticated and wide-scale surveillance systems in the world, politicians have called for better privacy protections. Laws  have been beefed up to better protect consumer data. And it has had an impact overseas, too: Ant Financial\u2019s deal to buy MoneyGram, the money-transfer company, collapsed amid concerns in the United States over a Chinese company having access to a large amount of financial data.\nIn part, the Sesame Credit moves by Ant Financial might have been trying to get around newer, stricter laws that would prevent them from sharing user data unless they had explicit permission, said Zhai Zhenyi, a lawyer at Yingke, a China-based law firm.\n\u201cProblems like telecom fraud and malicious marketing have severely vexed the general public, so people\u2019s consciousness about their rights is awakening,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a very good thing to see.\u201d\nThat consciousness may not extend to government collection of data, even though China\u2019s biggest internet companies often provide user information to Beijing.\nAnt Financial\u2019s credit system resembles one the government itself plans to soon implement.\nBeijing has said it will introduce in 2020 its own social credit system that is expected to give and take away privileges based on spending habits, online and real-world behavior, and social relationships. Foreign travel, speedy internet, school access, and social benefits could all be granted or denied based on a person\u2019s score. The government system will most likely be at least partly dependent on data collected by companies like Alibaba and Tencent.\nIt is unclear how many Chinese are truly against such programs.\nMr. Li, the Beijing college student, said that many of his friends still shared the shopping breakdowns \u2014 which now include a number indicating a user\u2019s Sesame Credit score.\nSuch is the power and ubiquity of Alibaba and Tencent in China, he added, that customers would find voting with their feet and quitting the services difficult.\n\u201cBeing angry doesn\u2019t do us any good,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe you can stop using Alipay if you are angry, but there\u2019s no way you could stop using WeChat.\u201d", "date": "Jan. 4, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/business/china-alibaba-privacy.html", "tags": "users credit want china expect \u201d data financial chinese tracked internet privacy"}
