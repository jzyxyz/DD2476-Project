{"title": "The GOP Health Bill Is As Unpopular As Ever", "content": "The Republican bill to repeal Obamacare remains as unpopular as ever, a new survey finds. \nJust under one-third of the public favored the American Health Care Act after it passed the House in early May \u2015 and that may have been a ceiling. A\u00a0new HuffPost/YouGov poll\u00a0shows 26 percent of the public supporting the bill, and 44 percent opposing it. A significant portion, 31 percent, remains undecided. The poll was taken before the Congressional Budget Office released its new estimate of the bill\u2019s impact on Wednesday afternoon.\nAmericans are split on the value of the current health care law, according to the poll, with 41 percent in favor and 42 percent opposed. (Other recent surveys have found somewhat higher support.) But by a nearly 2 to 1 margin, 42 percent to 23 percent, they say they expect that the GOP alternative would be a change for the worse, not the better.\nJust 12 percent of Americans expect the GOP\u2019s bill to affect them positively if it passes, while 31 percent say it would leave them personally worse off. The majority, 57 percent, say they wouldn\u2019t be affected or that they\u2019re not sure what the effects would be.\nSixty-two percent of Trump voters say they support the AHCA \u2015 that number is up from March but down from the 75 percent who favored it earlier this month. Just 3 percent of Clinton voters support the bill, which represents little change from past surveys.\nAs in previous polls, staunch opposition to the bill far outweighs any fervent support. Just 6 percent of people strongly favor the bill, while more than five times as many, 32 percent, strongly oppose it.\nOne reason that uncertainty about the bill remains as high as it\u2019s ever been: The AHCA has struggled to stay in the news amid a rapid-fire accumulation of other political stories, including controversies over the Trump administration\u2019s relationship with Russia. While 83 percent of people say they\u2019ve heard at least something about the new bill, just about one-third say they\u2019ve heard a lot about it recently. \nAnd although Americans are both unenthused about the AHCA and bothered by some of the most recent Russia stories, there are signs that the former is currently the more politically damaging issue. For one thing, Trump\u2019s supporters have rallied to his side around the Russia revelations in a way they haven\u2019t with the health bill. \nFor another, people simply seem to care a lot more about their own health care. Asked to pick the two issues most important to them, 47 percent of Americans named health care, outranking every single other issue listed. The economy ranked second, at 38 percent.\u00a0Immigration came in at 20 percent. Just 12 percent chose Trump\u2019s relationship with Russia as one of the issues most important to them.\nUse the widget below to further explore the results of the HuffPost/YouGov survey, using the menu at the top to select survey questions and the buttons at the bottom to filter the data by subgroups:\nThe HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted May 22-23 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov\u2019s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.\nHuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.You can learn more\u00a0about this project and\u00a0take part\u00a0in YouGov\u2019s nationally representative opinion polling.

More details on the polls\u2019 methodology are available\u00a0here.\nMost surveys report a margin of error that represents some, but not all, potential survey errors. YouGov\u2019s reports include a model-based margin of error, which rests on a specific set of statistical assumptions about the selected sample, rather than the standard methodology for random probability sampling. If these assumptions are wrong, the model-based margin of error may also be inaccurate.\u00a0Click here\u00a0for a more detailed explanation of the model-based margin of error.", "date": "\n05/24/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/republicans-health-bill-remains-as-unpopular-as-ever_n_5925e5a5e4b0265790f4a71f?mv9", "tags": "ever may huffpost/yougov percent margin unpopular gop say survey bill new care health"}
