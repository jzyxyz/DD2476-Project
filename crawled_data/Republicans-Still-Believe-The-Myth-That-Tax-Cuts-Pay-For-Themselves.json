{"title": "Republicans Still Believe The Myth That Tax Cuts Pay For Themselves", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2015 House Republicans have giddily greeted the GOP\u2019s tax reform proposal thus far, with some lawmakers suggesting they\u2019re ready to pass a yet-to-be written bill as soon as they get their hands on it. But that enthusiasm shouldn\u2019t be a shock when the Republicans making the laws falsely believe one thing \u2015 that tax cuts pay for themselves.\nYes, tax cuts can create economic growth, which can in turn increase revenue. But recent history has shown that tax cuts aren\u2019t without a cost. If you\u2019d like a lesson in the matter, ask Kansas.\u00a0\nOr just look at the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts under former President George W. Bush.\nRather than paying for themselves or unleashing the economy, the Bush tax cuts significantly contributed to increases in the deficit. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the Bush tax cuts will be responsible for 40 percent of our national debt by 2019. And there isn\u2019t clear evidence that those tax cuts created economic growth \u2015 certainly not enough to offset the cost of the cuts.\nEven the CBO\u2019s most modest analysis, excluding the effect of having to pay interest on extra debt, said the 2001 tax cuts contributed more than a trillion dollars to the national debt in their first 10 years.\nWhen HuffPost talked to conservative economist Douglas Holtz-Eakin about the deficit impact of tax cuts on Thursday, the former CBO director was emphatic: Tax cuts do not pay for themselves.\n\u201cWe have all sorts of evidence to that effect,\u201d Holtz-Eakin said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any evidence, over any interval, that they pay for themselves. Over any sustained period, they don\u2019t.\u201d\nFormer Ronald Reagan economic adviser Bruce Bartlett, who helped write Reagan\u2019s tax cuts and\u00a0literally wrote the book on Reaganomics,\u00a0published an op-ed in the Washington Post on Thursday titled: \u201cI helped create the GOP tax myth. Trump is wrong: Tax cuts don\u2019t equal growth.\u201d\nBartlett said most Republican rhetoric about tax cutting is \u201cwishful thinking.\u201d\n\u201cIn reality,\u201d Bartlett wrote, \u201cthere\u2019s no evidence that a tax cut now would spur growth.\u201d\nBut that thought would come as a surprise to most House Republicans, who are apparently convinced that tax cuts do\u00a0create growth and\u00a0do\u00a0bring in more money than they cost.\nWhile we don\u2019t have enough specifics to know the price tag of the GOP\u2019s latest proposal, it seems clear there won\u2019t be enough offsets on the individual side to make up for the cuts that Republicans are planning, particularly because Republicans believe they don\u2019t need to offset cuts. Under that ideology, a good bet is that the proposal, if enacted, would substantially contribute to the national debt.\nNeither the Trump administration nor House Republicans seem likely to admit that, however. Instead, if their answers over the last two days are any indication, they will endorse the convenient fantasy that tax cuts pay for themselves.\n\u201cI am one who is convinced that if we reduce tax rates, eventually we will bring in more money into the Treasury,\u201d Rep. Ted Poe (R-Texas) told HuffPost on Wednesday.\nWhen HuffPost asked Poe about the 2001 tax cuts, whether they brought more money into the Treasury, he claimed they did.\nAgain, the 2001 tax cuts definitively did not increase revenue, unless you believe the economy would have cratered without those cuts. Certainly, the cuts didn\u2019t live up to the projections of Republicans at the time. The Bush administration said the tax cuts would create a $3 trillion surplus. That didn\u2019t happen. \nNow the current GOP administration is using more make-believe math to argue that their new proposed tax cuts will reduce deficits by $1 trillion over the next decade, as Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin claimed Thursday.\u00a0\nA projection like that is outlandish on its face,\u00a0as there isn\u2019t a clear line\u00a0historically between tax cuts and growth, but it\u2019s especially laughable because there isn\u2019t even a bill yet. Anyone who tells you they know the effects of an unwritten piece of legislation is being less than truthful.\nWe do know, however, that there is no evidence the 2001 tax cuts paid for themselves. Despite all the evidence otherwise,\u00a0time and again this week, the Republicans making tax laws now revealed a flawed understanding of the effects of cuts in our recent history.\n\u201cThe 2001 tax cuts weren\u2019t revenue-neutral,\u201d Rep. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) told us. \u201cThey generated a lot of revenue.\u201d\nWhen HuffPost told Cramer that nearly every credible economist says those tax cuts did not bring down debt, he responded that, \u201cThe problem is the numbers don\u2019t support that,\u201d ignoring that the numbers actually do.\u00a0\nFormer economics professor Rep. Dave Brat (R-Va.) effectively avoided answering whether the 2001 cuts paid for themselves, but he did argue that a better economy\u00a0could pay for tax cuts, saying he believed this proposal would garner 1 percent in extra gross domestic product growth.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be happy with something that is revenue-neutral,\u201d Brat said. \u201cI want growth.\u201d\nWhat Brat is suggesting is that this tax reform will bring in money, which is the position many conservatives and Trump administration officials seem to be taking, while simultaneously arguing that Republicans shouldn\u2019t abide by static scoring rules that require offset measures to cut taxes in a reconciliation bill.\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about the rules; I care about reality,\u201d Brat said. \u201cThat\u2019s a good line. That rhymes. It\u2019s got a little alliteration.\u201d\nThe House Freedom Caucus, of which Brat is a member, has argued to leaders like Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) that the GOP\u2019s tax proposal should not offset all of its cuts. Ryan was a major proponent of the so-called border adjustment tax, which would have taxed imports and been a major source of revenue. But conservatives and some other Republicans opposed the idea, so now the GOP is simply cutting taxes and hoping that they\u2019ll make back the lost money with miraculous economic growth.\nFreedom Caucus chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) told reporters this week that an aggressive tax cut would \u201cfar offset the short-term deficit issues, even for a deficit-hawk.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI can make a compelling case that, over a 15-to-16-year period, depending on where the rates ultimately end up, that the economic growth would pay for itself,\u201d he said.\nStrangely, though, while Meadows thinks these tax cuts will end up making the government money, he was the only House Republican we talked to who explicitly said the 2001 cuts did not pay for themselves.\nRepublicans have argued that tax cuts are the one area where Congress doesn\u2019t need to be fiscal hawks. Lawmakers will often remind you that it\u2019s not the government\u2019s money. \u201cTo say tax cuts aren\u2019t paying for themselves, I can live with that,\u201d Rep. Ted Yoho (R-Fla.), who is also a Freedom Caucus member, told HuffPost.\nBut those same conservatives are also the ones most likely to pontificate about unsustainable debt.\nOn Tuesday, as the monthly \u201cConversations with Conservatives\u201d event on Capitol Hill was wrapping up, Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) interjected with a speech about \u201cthe No. 1 issue facing our country.\u201d\n\u201cWe are headed towards an insolvency and bankruptcy,\u201d Brooks said, going on to detail the nation\u2019s growing deficits \u2015 roughly $700 billion this year, with a debt that is now above $20 trillion.\nAnd then, on Wednesday, after the Republican retreat on tax reform, Brooks spoke positively about the tax cut proposal \u2015 at least as positively as Mo Brooks speaks about any bill that hasn\u2019t been written yet.\nHe said he was still worried about the deficit and debt, and that it\u2019d be difficult for him to vote for any tax proposal that decreases revenue, but he suggested he would trust an \u201ceconomic projection [by a third party] of how much additional economic growth there may be\u201d over a traditional score from the CBO.\nIn short, even though numerous studies have shown there\u2019s little relation between tax rates and economic growth, Brooks \u2015 like most House Republicans \u2015 is willing to believe this tax reform could pay for itself.\nIf you choose to believe that doing the politically popular thing of letting people keep more of their money also does the politically popular thing of reducing the national debt, it\u2019s not so difficult to vote for tax cuts. You\u2019re just not being honest about the consequences of your choices.", "date": "\n09/29/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/republicans-tax-cuts-offsets_n_59cd664ce4b05f005d3327d5", "tags": "debt tax growth cuts would \u201d pay republicans believe myth still"}
