{"title": "Report Criticizes Comey but Finds No Bias in F.B.I. Decision on Clinton", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Justice Department\u2019s inspector general on Thursday painted a harsh portrait of the F.B.I. during the 2016 presidential election, describing a destructive culture in which James B. Comey, the former director, was \u201cinsubordinate,\u201d senior officials privately bashed Donald J. Trump and agents came to distrust prosecutors.\nThe 500-page report criticized Mr. Comey for breaking with longstanding policy and publicly discussing \u2014 in a news conference and a pair of letters in the middle of the campaign \u2014 an investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server in handling classified information. The report was a firm rebuke of those actions, which Mr. Comey has tried for months to defend.\nNevertheless, the inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, did not challenge the conclusion that Mrs. Clinton should not be prosecuted. That investigation loomed over most of the presidential campaign, and Mr. Horowitz and his investigators uncovered no proof that political opinions at the F.B.I. influenced its outcome.\n\u201cWe found no evidence that the conclusions by department prosecutors were affected by bias or other improper considerations,\u201d he wrote. \u201cRather, we concluded that they were based on the prosecutor\u2019s assessment of facts, the law and past department practice.\u201d\nBut the report \u2014 initiated in response to a chorus of requests from Congress and the public \u2014 was far from an exoneration. Mr. Horowitz was unsparing in his criticism of Mr. Comey and referred five F.B.I. employees for possible discipline over pro-Clinton or anti-Trump commentary in electronic messages. He said agents were far too cozy with journalists. And he described a breakdown in the chain of command, calling it \u201cextraordinary\u201d that the attorney general acceded to Mr. Comey during the most controversial moments of the Clinton investigation.\nThe result, Mr. Horowitz said, undermined public confidence in the F.B.I. and sowed doubt about the bureau\u2019s handling of the Clinton investigation, which even two years later remains politically divisive. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s supporters blame Mr. Comey for her election loss. Mr. Trump believes that Mr. Comey and his agents conspired to clear Mrs. Clinton of wrongdoing because they were openly hostile to his candidacy.\nMr. Horowitz repeatedly said he found no evidence that the F.B.I. rigged the outcome. \u201cOur review did not find documentary or testimonial evidence directly connecting the political views these employees expressed in their text messages and instant messages to the specific investigative decisions we reviewed,\u201d the report said.\nThe report is especially critical of two F.B.I. officials, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, who exchanged texts disparaging Mr. Trump. Many of those text messages had already been released, but the report cites a previously undisclosed exchange:\nMr. Trump is \u201cnot ever going to become president, right? Right?!\u201d Ms. Page wrote.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Mr. Strzok wrote. \u201cNo he won\u2019t. We\u2019ll stop it.\u201d\nMs. Page has left the F.B.I. and Mr. Strzok has been reassigned to human resources. Like other top F.B.I. officials, they were involved in both the Clinton case and the investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia. So while the inspector general\u2019s report focuses entirely on the Clinton case, it has ramifications for the investigation being carried out by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. Any evidence of bias or rule-breaking in one case could be used to undermine confidence in the other.\nMr. Trump has repeatedly declared the Russia investigation a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and was eagerly anticipating the release of Thursday\u2019s report. He was briefed on it but was notably silent about the conclusions.\nThe Republican National Committee, though, distributed talking points to supporters criticizing a \u201cfervent anti-Trump bias\u201d and calling for Mr. Strzok\u2019s termination. The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, offered few remarks.\n\u201cIt reaffirmed the president\u2019s suspicions about Comey\u2019s conduct and the political bias among some of the members of the F.B.I.,\u201d she said. But she referred questions to the current F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray.\nMr. Wray, in a rare news conference, said he took the report seriously but said that nothing in the report \u201cimpugns the integrity\u201d of the F.B.I. \u201cOur brand is doing just fine,\u201d he said.\nMr. Wray was confirmed last year after the abrupt firing of Mr. Comey, and the report serves as an unflattering book end to Mr. Comey\u2019s three-and-a-half-year tenure. The findings sharply criticize his judgment as he injected the F.B.I. into presidential politics in ways not seen since at least the Watergate era.\nMr. Comey held a news conference in July 2016 to announce that he was recommending no charges against Mrs. Clinton and to publicly chastise her email practices. It was highly unorthodox; the Justice Department, not the F.B.I., makes charging decisions. And officials have been reprimanded for injecting their opinions into legal conclusions. Mr. Comey withheld his plans for a public statement from his bosses at the Justice Department.\n\u201cIt was extraordinary and insubordinate for Comey to do so,\u201d the inspector general wrote, \u201cand we found none of his reasons to be a persuasive basis for deviating from well-established department policies in a way intentionally designed to avoid supervision by department leadership.\u201d\nThen in late October, over the objection of top Justice Department officials, Mr. Comey sent a letter to Congress disclosing that agents were scrutinizing new evidence in the Clinton case.\nThat evidence did not change the outcome of the inquiry, but Mrs. Clinton and many of her supporters blame Mr. Comey\u2019s late disclosure for her defeat. Former campaign aides expressed disbelief Thursday at another revelation in the report \u2014 that Mr. Comey had used a private email account to conduct official F.B.I. business while he supervised the investigation into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email practices. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry,\u201d said Brian Fallon, the former campaign spokesman.\nAnd Mrs. Clinton herself responded on Twitter, noting only, \u201cBut my emails.\u201d\nMr. Comey has defended his actions, saying he would have faced criticism for any decision, so he opted to be transparent. F.B.I. officials have acknowledged that they made those decisions in part because they assumed Mrs. Clinton would win, and they worried about appearing to conceal information to help her.\nMr. Comey and his agents also grew suspicious of Justice Department prosecutors. Working-level agents wanted prosectors to be more aggressive \u2014 a tension that the inspector general found \u201ccaused significant strife and mistrust\u201d between the two groups.\nMr. Comey, too, said his decisions were influenced in part by concerns that political appointees at the Justice Department did not have the credibility to close the investigation. In an Op-Ed published in The New York Times responding to the report, Mr. Comey said he believed he was making the right decisions at the time.\n\u201cAs painful as the whole experience has been, I still believe that,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd nothing in the inspector general\u2019s report makes me think we did the wrong thing.\u201d\nMr. Comey has cultivated a reputation for fierce independence and supreme self-confidence. Those traits were both assets and vulnerabilities. Agents widely saw him as a strong leader.\nBut Mr. Comey believed that he was the only one who could steer the F.B.I. through the political winds of the Clinton case, and that left him alone to answer for the bureau\u2019s actions.\nOfficially at least, Mr. Comey\u2019s handling of the Clinton case cost him his job. After the firing, the White House held up as justification a Justice Department memo that criticized many of the actions now highlighted by the inspector general. In that regard, the inspector general would seem to underscore the stated reason for Mr. Comey\u2019s dismissal.\nBut Mr. Trump has muddied this issue. Hours after the firing, he undercut his own staff and said that he had planned to fire Mr. Comey even before receiving the recommendation. He said he had been thinking about the Russia investigation when he fired Mr. Comey. His lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, added more recently that Mr. Comey was fired for refusing to publicly exonerate Mr. Trump in the Russia case.\nThose comments, along with Mr. Comey\u2019s account of private conversations with the president, prompted the appointment of a special counsel to begin investigating Mr. Trump for possible obstruction of justice. That inquiry continues. The inspector general\u2019s report does not directly affect that case, though anything that undermines Mr. Comey\u2019s credibility is politically and legally beneficial to Mr. Trump.\nThe inspector general is separately reviewing some aspects of the Russia investigation, including Mr. Trump\u2019s theory \u2014 backed up by no evidence \u2014 that the F.B.I. spied on his campaign for political purposes. Those matters were not covered in Thursday\u2019s report.\nMr. Horowitz\u2019s investigation has already led to the firing of one top F.B.I. official, the former deputy director Andrew G. McCabe. Mr. Horowitz issued a report in March that said Mr. McCabe had been dishonest about his contacts with the news media about Mrs. Clinton.\nMr. McCabe has been a frequent target of Mr. Trump\u2019s ire and is central to his theory that the F.B.I. secretly worked to exonerate Mrs. Clinton. Mr. McCabe\u2019s wife ran unsuccessfully as a Democrat for the Virginia State Senate and received significant campaign donations from an ally of Mrs. Clinton. Despite the president\u2019s criticism, the inspector general said on Thursday that Mr. McCabe had not been required to recuse himself from the Clinton case.\nAmong Mr. Horowitz\u2019s original tasks was to identify whether F.B.I. agents improperly disclosed information about the Clinton case to reporters. But his inquiry was stymied, he said, because improper contacts with journalists were so common. \u201cThe large number of F.B.I. employees who were in contact with journalists during this time period impacted our ability to identify the sources of leaks,\u201d he wrote.\nThe report omitted any discussion of a potential leak of information in fall 2016 to Mr. Giuliani, who was then one of Mr. Trump\u2019s key campaign surrogates but not yet his lawyer. Shortly before Mr. Comey announced the discovery of new emails in the Clinton case, Mr. Giuliani appeared on Fox News and hinted that major news was about to break: \u201cI mean, I\u2019m talking about some pretty big surprises,\u201d he said.\nMr. Horowitz has indicated that another report addressing leaks is forthcoming. It is not clear whether Mr. Giuliani\u2019s remarks will be addressed.", "date": "June 14, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/14/us/politics/fbi-inspector-general-comey-trump-clinton-report.html", "tags": "finds bias f.b.i report comey clinton \u201d trump decision general criticizes"}
