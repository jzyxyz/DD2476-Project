{"title": "Pompeo Speech Lays Out Vision for Mideast, Taking Shots at Obama", "content": "CAIRO \u2014 Secretary of State Mike Pompeo laid out his vision for America\u2019s role in the Middle East on Thursday, telling a university audience in Cairo that \u201cthe age of self-inflicted American shame is over\u201d and that the United States would pursue a more activist policy, despite President Trump\u2019s decision to pull troops out of Syria.\nMr. Pompeo\u2019s prescription was short on specifics, beyond bolstering alliances with Arab autocrats loyal to Washington. Instead he painted a picture of a Middle East cast into chaos by President Barack Obama, and that can only be rescued by crushing Iran.\nHe advocated a policy of containment of Iran\u2019s power, pressing for allies in the region to isolate the country. He vowed to \u201cexpel every last Iranian boot\u201d from Syria, but offered no plan to achieve that goal at a moment when the American force of 2,000 troops is scheduled to withdraw.\nAnd in an unusually explicit and personal attack on a former president\u2019s foreign policy, a decade after Mr. Obama delivered a landmark speech at another Cairo university, Mr. Pompeo excoriated Mr. Obama for \u201cfundamental misunderstandings\u201d about the region that \u201cunderestimated the tenacity and viciousness of radical Islamism.\u201d\nMr. Pompeo\u2019s stop in Cairo was part of a nine-nation tour of the region, which, along with a trip this week by the national security adviser, John R. Bolton, was intended to reassure jittery allies concerned about the Syrian withdrawal.\n[Mr. Pompeo\u2019s speech included some exaggerations. A fact-check.]\nMr. Trump\u2019s announcement last month that United States forces would leave Syria within 30 days has created a diplomatic tangle with Turkey and, since the resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, has led to fears among allies that Mr. Trump is not on the same page as his national security team.\nMr. Trump said that his only reason for remaining in Syria was the defeat of the Islamic State, a job he said had been completed. Only three months ago, Mr. Bolton promised that American forces would not leave Syria until the Iranians were out of the country.\nBut if anything, the two officials left the administration\u2019s message muddier than they found it. In Jerusalem on Sunday, Mr. Bolton laid out conditions for withdrawal that could leave American troops in Syria indefinitely.\nAsked at a news conference on Thursday to reconcile the apparent contradictions, Mr. Pompeo said: \u201cThere\u2019s no contradiction whatsoever. This is a story made up by the media.\u201d\nLater that afternoon, Mr. Pompeo declared that \u201cwhen America retreats, chaos follows,\u201d part of a broadside against Mr. Obama\u2019s policies. But the declaration confounded many in the region who interpreted the president\u2019s orders as the definition of a retreat.\nMr. Pompeo argued that it does not take troops on the ground to influence events.\n\u201cLet me be clear: America will not retreat until the terror fight is over,\u201d he said.\nMr. Pompeo picked the timing and locale of his speech, the American University in Cairo, for dramatic effect, a deliberate echo of the setting for Mr. Obama\u2019s speech. Mr. Obama\u2019s 2009 speech, an effort to reset relations with the Muslim world in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks and the Iraq war, has proved a reliable foil for the Trump administration, and Mr. Pompeo devoted much of his speech to blaming Mr. Obama for the region\u2019s ills.\nMr. Pompeo did not refer to Mr. Obama by name \u2014 noting only that \u201cit was here, here in this city, that another American stood before you\u201d \u2014 but he otherwise appeared to relish the stark differences between them.\n[Dueling speeches: Pompeo in 2019 vs. Obama in 2009.]\nHe castigated Mr. Obama for having said that American fear and anger after the Sept. 11 attack \u201cled us to act contrary to our ideals,\u201d a reference to the use of torture. Mr. Pompeo characterized that remark and others as \u201cfalsely\u201d blaming the United States \u201cfor what ails the Middle East.\u201d\n\u201cIt is a truth that isn\u2019t often spoken in this part of the world, but I\u2019m a military man by training, so I\u2019ll put it bluntly,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said. \u201cAmerica is a force for good in the Middle East. Period.\u201d\nMr. Obama\u2019s era was a time of disastrous misjudgments, he said. \u201cWhat did we learn from all this?\u201d he said. \u201cWhen America retreats, chaos follows. When we neglect our friends, resentment builds. When we partner with enemies, they advance.\u201d\nMore broadly, though, the two leaders were addressing entirely different audiences. While Mr. Obama appealed to ordinary Muslims, with citations from the Quran and flowery tributes to Islamic culture, Mr. Pompeo spoke squarely to a smaller group: the kings, princes and military rulers who have ensured American influence for decades and who were crucial to countering Iran.\n\u201cCountries increasingly understand that we must confront the ayatollahs, not coddle them,\u201d he said.\nIran immediately denounced the speech.\n\u201cWhenever/wherever U.S. interferes, chaos, repression and resentment follow,\u201d the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, wrote on Twitter hours after Mr. Pompeo spoke. \u201cThe day Iran mimics U.S. clients,\u201d he said, \u201cis the day hell freezes over.\u201d\nMr. Obama\u2019s speech was the opening gesture to Iran, an indication that the United States was willing to negotiate on what appeared to be a growing program to produce nuclear fuel. The combination of his diplomatic opening, economic pressure and a covert cyberattack on Iran\u2019s nuclear enrichment program drove Iran to the negotiating table.\nThe result was the 2015 nuclear agreement, which Mr. Trump abandoned last year. Mr. Pompeo defended the decision, saying the agreement, which would have kept Iran from producing enough fuel for a bomb until 2030, was an example of \u201cwillful blindness to the danger of the regime.\u201d\nUnder Mr. Trump, he said, \u201cthe U.S. reimposed sanctions that should never have been lifted.\u201d\nMr. Pompeo avoided any discussion of human rights, a major theme of Mr. Obama\u2019s speech. The word \u201crights\u201d does not appear once in Mr. Pompeo\u2019s text.\nHe praised Saudi Arabia for helping contain Iran, but did not mention the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi dissident whose death in a Saudi consulate in October caused global outrage.\nHe made no direct reference to rampant human rights abuses in Egypt under President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, or to the estimated 60,000 political opponents human rights groups say are languishing in Egyptian jails.\nAnd while Mr. Obama spoke of Palestinian suffering and national aspirations, Mr. Pompeo made only a glancing reference to the Palestinians and repeatedly stressed America\u2019s ties to Israel and the threats it faced.\nFormer Obama officials sprang to defend their legacy.\n\u201cListening to Secretary Pompeo\u2019s speech is like listening to someone from a parallel universe,\u201d said Robert Malley, Mr. Obama\u2019s coordinator for the Middle East. He called the speech \u201ca self-congratulatory, delusional depiction of the Trump administration\u2019s Middle East policy.\u201d\nJeffrey Prescott of National Security Action, a group led by former Obama officials, said it showcased the Trump administration\u2019s obsession with Iran and with Mr. Obama. \u201cPompeo sees his audience as the region\u2019s autocrats rather than its people,\u201d he said.\nWhere Mr. Pompeo found hope in the region, it was mostly in closer links between American allies, or in overtures to Christians.\n\u201cWho could\u2019ve believed a few years ago that an Israeli prime minister would visit Muscat?\u201d he said. \u201cOr that a Roman Catholic pope would visit this city to meet with Muslim imams and the head of the Coptic faith?\u201d\nAfter the speech, Mr. Pompeo drove 30 miles east of Cairo to the new administrative capital, where he visited two new places of a worship, a soaring Coptic cathedral and a sweeping mosque. \u201cPresident Sisi has permitted these kinds of freedoms,\u201d he said.\nBut Mr. Sisi\u2019s embrace of Christians has limits. Construction of new churches is restricted in much of Egypt. Christians are excluded from senior government jobs, especially in the security services.", "date": "Jan. 10, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/world/middleeast/mike-pompeo-speech-middle-east-obama.html", "tags": "american iran taking speech \u201c lays shots mideast vision pompeo obama"}
