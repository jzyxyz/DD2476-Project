{"title": "Supreme Court Blocks Louisiana Abortion Law", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday temporarily blocked a Louisiana law that its opponents say would leave the state with only one abortion clinic. The court gave no reasons, though it did say that its order was \u201cconsistent with\u201d one last June that blocked part of a Texas abortion law.\nThe move came two days after the Supreme Court heard arguments in the Texas case, and abortion rights groups said they hoped that the development Friday was a sign that they had secured five votes to strike down the Texas law.\nOnly Justice Clarence Thomas noted a dissent from the order Friday, suggesting that the vote had been 7 to 1, but justices do not always disclose their dissenting votes on such orders. In the order blocking the Texas law in June, the court\u2019s four most conservative members noted their dissents, making it clear that the vote had been 5 to 4.\nThe order Friday suggested that the Louisiana law would remain blocked until the court renders its decision in the Texas case, Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt, No. 15-274.\nJeff Landry, Louisiana\u2019s attorney general, said in a statement that \u201cwe disagree with the Court\u2019s unexplained decision,\u201d adding that he would \u201ccontinue to defend Louisiana\u2019s pro-life and pro-woman laws.\u201d\nNancy Northup, the president of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement that the Supreme Court had again \u201cstepped in to preserve women\u2019s ability to get the constitutionally protected health care they need.\u201d\n\u201cJust two days after arguing our case before the Supreme Court to strike down a similar sweeping law in Texas,\u201d she added, \u201cwe look to the justices to put an end to these sham measures threatening women\u2019s rights, health and lives across the U.S.\u201d\nThe Louisiana law, enacted in 2014, requires doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. A trial judge blocked the law, saying that such doctors were often unable to obtain admitting privileges for reasons unrelated to their competence and that the law created an undue burden on a woman\u2019s constitutional right to abortion.\nOn Feb. 22, the federal appeals court in New Orleans stayed that ruling, allowing the law to go into effect.\nThe two sides disagree about the law\u2019s impact. The challengers \u2014 three clinics and two doctors \u2014 said that the appeals court\u2019s ruling caused one of the state\u2019s four remaining clinics to close the next day, while a second began providing only consultations. A third, in Shreveport, is operating but may not do so for long, they said.\nIf it closes, according to the challengers, the state would be left with a single abortion doctor at a single clinic, in New Orleans.\n\u201cThat lone doctor, working in one clinic, cannot meet the need for approximately 10,000 abortions in Louisiana each year, a need that was previously met by six physicians in five clinics across the state,\u201d the clinics challenging the law told the Supreme Court in an emergency application on Feb. 26. \u201cAs a result, many women will be unable to exercise their constitutionally protected right to choose abortion at all, and others will face unreasonable delays and therefore increased risks of complications, or will turn to self-performed, unlicensed or unsafe abortions.\u201d\nIn their own brief, state officials said things were not that dire. Three doctors, they said, have admitting privileges \u201cthat allow them to continue to provide abortions in two of the major population centers in Louisiana \u2014 Shreveport and New Orleans.\u201d\n\u201cAt worst,\u201d the state told the justices, the law \u201cwould still leave over 90 percent of Louisiana women within 150 miles of an operating abortion clinic.\u201d\nLouisiana laws impose other restrictions, including a 24-hour waiting period after a first trip to a clinic, at which a doctor must describe an ultrasound to the woman seeking an abortion.\nThe admitting-privileges provision at issue in the case, June Medical Services v. Gee, No. 15A880, is similar to one in the Texas law the Supreme Court considered on Wednesday. The Texas law has a second contested provision, that one requiring abortion clinics to meet the demanding standards of ambulatory surgical centers.\nAt arguments on Wednesday, at least four justices seemed prepared to find both provisions unconstitutional. The order on Friday may indicate that Justice Anthony M. Kennedy agrees.", "date": "March 4, 2016", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/05/us/politics/supreme-court-blocks-louisiana-abortion-law.html", "tags": "louisiana blocks court \u201d supreme abortion state law texas"}
