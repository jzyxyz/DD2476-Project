{"title": "Fans Should Boycott NFL Games Over National Anthem Protests, Trump Says", "content": "President Donald Trump went after players protesting in the National Football League during his speech Friday in Alabama to campaign for Sen.\u00a0Luther Strange.\u00a0\nWhile Trump took the stage in Huntsville to ostensibly rally support for Strange in his upcoming Republican primary, his speech veered away from politics to attack NFL players who protest during the national anthem.\nLast year, then-San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick was booed for taking a knee during the national anthem\u00a0while his team played the San Diego Chargers. Kaepernick said the silent protest was meant to bring awareness to injustices against minorities in the United States. It has been a source of controversy ever since.\nKaepernick remains a free agent, and many believe that his inability to land with a new team is due to his political stance. But inspired by his example, many other NFL players have replicated his actions.\u00a0\nBut Trump blasted that form of protest during his speech. \u201cThat\u2019s a total disrespect of our heritage,\u201d the president told the crowd. \u201cThat\u2019s a total disrespect of everything we stand for.\u201d\nTrump told the audience that anyone attending NFL games should leave if they see a player protesting during the anthem and that players should be fired for the action.\u00a0\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, \u2018get that son of a bitch off the field right now, he\u2019s fired?\u2019\u201d Trump said.\u00a0\nThe majority of players protesting during games have been players of color, using their platforms in an attempt to highlight racial injustice and police brutality.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Trump has taken shots at Kaepernick. Trump has tweeted a few times about the athlete and even took credit for Kaepernick\u2019s\u00a0inability to get a job in the league after his protests.\u00a0\nNonetheless, Kaepernick\u2019s message appears to have resonated elsewhere in sports.\nEarlier this year,\u00a0several New England Patriots players refused to attend the White House, a traditional visit for teams who win sports championships. Some of the players who stayed away said that Trump displayed racist rhetoric throughout his campaign and that they wouldn\u2019t feel accepted in the White House.\nAnd in professional basketball, not long before the Alabama rally,\u00a0Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry announced that he wouldn\u2019t attend the teams\u2019 own visit to the White House, USA Today reported.\n\u2033(Athletes are) all trying to do what we can,\u201d Curry said. \u201cWe\u2019re using our platforms, using our opportunities to shed light on that, so that\u2019s kind of where I stand on it. I don\u2019t think us not going to the White House is going to miraculously make everything better, but this is my opportunity to voice that.\u201d\nBernice King, daughter of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., took to Twitter\u00a0on Friday night to denounce Trump\u2019s speech.\n\u201cA nation is people, not a symbol,\u201d King wrote. \u201cA protest for the eradication of racism that violates millions of those people is not disrespect.\u201d\nAfter a huge backlash, Trump didn\u2019t back away from his\u00a0Friday\u00a0comments and reiterated them in two tweets\u00a0Saturday, saying that the NFL should fire players who protest.\n\u00a0", "date": "\n09/22/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-kaepernick-alabama-rally_n_59c5b050e4b01cc57ff251fe?utm_hp_ref=nfl", "tags": "protest national anthem protests speech white trump players nfl says kaepernick fans games boycott"}
