{"title": "Nike and Pregnancy: Your Questions, Answered", "content": "On Mother\u2019s Day, New York Times Opinion published the video below showing that while Nike promotes gender equality in its ads, their sponsored athletes say they risk losing pay if they become pregnant. \nThe video has generated much debate on our site and on social media. Below, we answer some questions asked by those who watched the video.\nNike\u2019s contracts give athletes who temporarily cannot compete a six-month grace period, during which the company can reduce their pay but cannot terminate the sponsorship. That provision was clearly written with injuries \u2014\u00a0but not the months of pregnancy and postpartum recovery \u2014\u00a0in mind. Nike\u2019s contracts are essentially saying that women are susceptible to having to compete while pregnant or soon after childbirth. Otherwise, they risk giving up pay.\nNike can choose to pay pregnant athletes \u2014 and these days, it often does. But that\u2019s not the same as an official policy that lets women know what to expect. Nike declined to answer our question whether it contractually guarantees women won\u2019t be penalized for pregnancy. As recently as this year, Nike refused a request for contractual pregnancy protection for an elite runner. \nNike-sponsored athletes can continue to make appearances on behalf of the company, even if they aren\u2019t racing. For example, Kara Goucher, an Olympian featured in the article that accompanied the video, made more than a dozen  marketing appearances on behalf of Nike during her pregnancy before learning she would not be paid because she wasn\u2019t racing. The company knows these athletes\u2019 value goes beyond racing.\nTrue. But Nike\u2019s contracts are exclusive, making it hard to scavenge for additional money on the side. And this is part of a bigger national conversation: As the gig economy grows in America, the nation\u2019s policies toward contractors need to change as well. (If our Olympians aren\u2019t safe, who is?) Really, all workers should have more options when it comes to taking time for their families \u2014 the United States is the only developed nation that doesn\u2019t guarantee paid parental leave. Since there are no laws to protect them, it\u2019s easy to take advantage. And then there\u2019s the hypocrisy issue: If you\u2019re going to preach gender equality, why not take the lead? \nThe video argued that Nike should institute the same policy for every woman so she knows what to expect before becoming pregnant, whether she\u2019s Serena Williams or a future track star. \nNike sponsors thousands of women. Across the industry, these female athletes make five figures far more often than millions. Not every woman is going to try to have a baby and stay at among the best in the world. But they should have the option.\nAfter the video appeared, Nike said in a statement that last year \u201cwe standardized our approach\u201d to paying athletes during pregnancy. But what is that approach? Is it a contractual guarantee? Nike has not yet responded to those questions. It\u2019s true that Nike does pay some women during their pregnancy, but the industry, led by Nike, should establish a contractual guarantee for all its sponsored female athletes. \nIt\u2019s not that women and their agents aren\u2019t trying to make better deals for themselves; they are. But Nike won\u2019t budge. Also, women often feel lucky to be offered any contract and don\u2019t want to jeopardize it. Remember, many of these women are the primary breadwinners for their families, including for their new babies. And revenue from sponsors is their main source of income. \nOnce they have signed, nondisclosure agreements typically keep them from speaking out about any aspects of their contracts that surprise them. Since the video appeared, I\u2019ve heard from women who have confirmed that they can\u2019t talk about this publicly because of the nondisclosure provisions in their contracts. Transparency is the first step to equality.\nNike is indisputably the industry leader in athletics and has the chance to follow through on the messaging that resonates so powerfully in its ads. Having a baby as an athlete shouldn\u2019t have to mean risking so much.\nThis is also a chance for other brands to speak up about how they support women\u2019s careers. Maybe New Balance, Adidas, Brooks, Reebok and Under Armour want to take the lead on this issue. \nAnd because men have most of the power in the sports industry, this is a moment for them to speak up and publicly support such policies. (This includes the exclusively male cast of executives at Nike who negotiate contracts for track and field athletes.)
