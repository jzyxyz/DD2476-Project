{"title": "In French Labor Overhaul, Union Leader Offers a Way to a Compromise", "content": "PARIS \u2014 As thousands of workers last summer protested changes to France\u2019s labor laws, Laurent Berger, the head of one of the country\u2019s most influential unions, got an unsettling call.\nAround 100 protesters had split from a rally and surrounded the headquarters of his union, the French Democratic Confederation of Labor, shouting and smashing windows. Scrawled near the entrance was a warning in red paint: \u201cThis treason must end!\u201d\nThe \u201ctreason\u201d referred to a contentious decision by Mr. Berger to support revisions to France\u2019s 3,400-page labor code \u2014 a rarity in a country known for stark divisions between union leaders and government officials. Some of the changes would relax rules around the cherished 35-hour workweek, which Mr. Berger saw as a way to encourage companies to hire.\nSuch union backing will be critical as President Emmanuel Macron moves to overhaul the economy and change the notoriously rigid labor law. Although Mr. Macron\u2019s party secured a sweeping parliamentary majority on Sunday, labor remains a powerful force to block change. And Mr. Berger\u2019s union, the most moderate in France, provides a potential path to compromise.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just had a profound political shift, so we\u2019re at a turning point where things can really change,\u201d Mr. Berger said in an interview.\nMuch is at stake. Unemployment has been stuck around 10 percent for four years, and the economy has failed to recover from the financial crisis as fast as Germany\u2019s.\nMr. Macron wants to steer France toward a more Scandinavian-style economic model known as \u201cflexible security.\u201d Pioneered in Denmark, it promotes consensus between unions and employers, and it aims to minimize joblessness by making it easy for companies to adjust their work force and by retraining the unemployed.\nThe idea is to no longer protect jobs for life, while giving people skills to transition to different careers.\n\u201cWorkers still need protection, but in a globalized world, the economy must be able to adjust, too,\u201d Mr. Berger said. \u201cIf unions just oppose everything, we\u2019ll never move forward.\u201d\nWhether Mr. Berger follows words with actions remains to be seen. The C.F.D.T., as the union is known, recently became France\u2019s largest when its membership surpassed the militant General Confederation of Labor, which has dominated the landscape for decades.\nAmid Mr. Macron\u2019s rise, Mr. Berger has sometimes painted his union as a moderating influence in France\u2019s labor movement at a crucial moment for the economy. Mr. Berger has pushed for a more flexible approach in France as the forces of globalization change the competitive landscape.\nYet he is not immune to protesting when the stakes are high. On Sunday, he urged Mr. Macron to maintain discussions with unions and employer groups \u2014 or risk new demonstrations.\nIn France, even small changes tend to rile labor organizations, which have historically sought to secure workplace protections through protests and strikes. The General Confederation of Labor, known as the C.G.T., has been at the forefront of mobilizing frequent, sometimes violent actions, whether burning tires or even holding bosses captive.\nAnd while unions are at their weakest membership levels ever \u2014 representing just 8 percent of the work force \u2014 they can still thwart big changes to totems like the length of the workweek, or measures that would undermine their own power.\nMr. Macron\u2019s plans contain several elements that unions, including the C.F.D.T., see as red lines. Foremost is a proposal to allow employers to negotiate directly with employees on a range of workplace issues, overriding sector-wide accords struck by unions. Labor organizations also oppose a measure to cap compensation awards in unfair dismissal cases.\nMr. Berger insists his union is not the government\u2019s foe. An imposing, energetic man from a working-class family in northern France, he became a labor activist after an early career helping disadvantaged and poor people.\nHe is willing to give employers more flexibility to downsize when the economy sours, provided that they hire when conditions improve and that those who lost jobs are protected and retrained.\nIn France, \u201cthere\u2019s a natural conflict between employers and employees,\u201d he said at the C.F.D.T. headquarters, where sun streamed through gleaming windows replacing the ones that had been smashed. \u201cBut does it take a battle or dialogue to build compromise? I choose dialogue.\u201d\nHis position has engendered detractors, who see the C.F.D.T. as selling out to business interests. The protesters who vandalized his offices denounced him as a traitor. Others wielded signs proclaiming, \u201cWhen slavery is re-established, the C.F.D.T. will negotiate the length of the chains!\u201d\nYet it would seem to be a strategic move in the era of Mr. Macron, a centrist whose swift rise has upended France\u2019s traditional power balance. His R\u00e9publique en Marche party\u2019s majority in the National Assembly will give him momentum to push a strongly pro-business agenda.\nDivisions within France\u2019s labor movement may play to Mr. Macron\u2019s advantage. The C.G.T., which traces its roots to the French Communist party, has never been overtaken by another union. It may face challenges if Mr. Berger\u2019s union sets a more moderate tone for trade-offs.\nPhilippe Martinez, the C.G.T.\u2019s leader, has said his organization does not necessarily oppose changes to the labor code. But last week, he maintained threats of mass protests if employee protections are cut too much.\nJust weeks into his presidency, Mr. Macron has already summoned labor leaders \u2014 starting with Mr. Berger \u2014 for marathon sessions to discuss overhaul plans, which will be fast-tracked through executive orders in summer. Mr. Macron has scheduled 50 more meetings with the unions through July, and more rounds in August and September.\n\u201cMacron is good at talking to the unions, at giving them something,\u201d said Philippe Aghion, an economics professor at Harvard and at the prestigious Coll\u00e8ge de France who mentored Mr. Macron as a student, and who advises him on labor policy. \u201cHe\u2019ll take what they say into account.\u201d\nStill, Mr. Macron\u2019s political wins mask weaknesses that are not lost on union leaders. His parliamentary victory was overshadowed by record-low voter turnout. And many who backed Mr. Macron for president did so to keep his rival, the far-right National Front leader Marine Le Pen, from winning \u2014 not to see him weaken labor protections.\n\u201cRight now, people are saying, \u2018He\u2019s just been elected president, let\u2019s give him a chance,\u2019\u201d Jean-Claude Mailly, the leader of Force Ouvri\u00e8re, the third-largest union, said at a recent news briefing. \u201cBut there\u2019s real anger in France.\u201d\nIn the current discontent, Mr. Berger is similarly walking a fine line between playing a leadership role during the president\u2019s overhaul drive, and placating members of his own union wary of radical change. Still, Mr. Berger insists he is not aiming to incite mass protests just yet.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a mentality in France that says we should cut off the heads of those at the top,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s also a French tendency to focus on things that could go wrong.\u201d\nHe paused, then continued in a firm voice. \u201cWe can change that,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI have no desire to be among those who keep saying, \u2018None of this will work.\u2019 It has to work,\u201d Mr. Berger added. \u201cBecause if it doesn\u2019t, we\u2019ll wind up with Le Pen in another five years. And things will be much, much worse.\u201d", "date": "June 20, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/20/business/macron-france-labor-union-laurent-berger.html", "tags": "labor unions overhaul \u201c france compromise way berger union macron leader \u2014 french offers"}
