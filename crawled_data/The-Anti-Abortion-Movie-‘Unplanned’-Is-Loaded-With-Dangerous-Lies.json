{"title": "The Anti-Abortion Movie \u2018Unplanned\u2019 Is Loaded With Dangerous Lies", "content": "\u201cUnplanned,\u201d a new movie in limited release, charts the unusual conversion story of Abby Johnson, a real-life Planned Parenthood clinic director in Bryan, Texas, who became an anti-abortion advocate after a crisis of conscience. The R-rated film, which Vice President\u00a0Mike Pence\u00a0plugged on Twitter earlier this month, has grossed $15.7 million since its debut on March 29, more than double its original budget.\nThe film follows Johnson, played in the movie by Ashley Bratcher, on her journey from Planned Parenthood employee of the year to disillusioned opponent of abortion. Along the way, it perpetuates distortions and potentially dangerous myths about the procedure.\nThe movie, co-written and co-directed by Cary Solomon and Chuck Konzelman, arrives at a time when the anti-abortion movement in the U.S. is emboldened and on the attack. This year, an unprecedented number of states have introduced bills to limit abortion. Alabama wants to outlaw abortion entirely. Texas is trying to make it punishable by death. The governors of Kentucky, Mississippi and Ohio have all signed six-week abortion bans into law, and Georgia\u2019s governor is expected to do the same soon. And now, \u201cUnplanned\u201d is stoking the flames with wild claims about the country\u2019s largest reproductive health care provider, Planned Parenthood.\nTo sort fact from fiction, HuffPost spoke to Jen Villavicencio, an OB-GYN and abortion provider in Michigan. Villavicencio is the inverse of Abby Johnson. As a teen in Florida, she was an anti-choice activist who prayed for the end of abortion. She had her own awakening at medical school, and now she provides abortions to women in clinics surrounded by protesters every day. \u201cI went from one extreme to another, just like Abby,\u201d she said.\nVillavicencio walked us through some of the more glaring inaccuracies in \u201cUnplanned\u201d:\nIn one of the first scenes in \u201cUnplanned,\u201d Abby is asked to help with an abortion for a woman who is 13 weeks pregnant. As Abby watches the procedure on a screen, it seems to her that the fetus squirms away from the doctor\u2019s medical instrument. It appears to be fighting for its life. \u201cBeam me up, Scotty!\u201d the doctor jokes as the patient sobs. Then, in an instant, the fetus is gone. The uterus is empty. \nThere have been questions raised about whether this abortion even took place. But in any case,\u00a0Villavicencio, who performs similar abortions, said the scene is wildly unrealistic. At that gestational age, fetuses do not have purposeful movements, she said. \n\u201cThe idea that a fetus would recoil or show fear or try to run away from a cannula [medical tube] is really a frank falsehood,\u201d she said. \u201cAll the evidence says that is not possible.\u201d \nAccording to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, a fetus does not have the physiological capacity to perceive pain until at least 24 weeks of gestation. But Villavicencio acknowledged that some people may have a strong reaction to witnessing an abortion.\n\u201cAny time I teach medical students, I tell them it is OK however they feel,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things in medicine that make people uncomfortable, but that doesn\u2019t mean they are inherently bad or wrong. It is possible to feel both things.\u201d\nAt the beginning of the movie, Abby is an open-minded college student who starts volunteering at Planned Parenthood because she wants to help women make informed decisions about their reproductive health.\u00a0But soon she realizes that a central part of her job involves making money for Planned Parenthood.\nAbby boasts about how good she got at \u201cselling abortions,\u201d comparing her job to that of a salesman hawking timeshares. Women are frequently shown handing over money. In one scene, Abby\u2019s boss, Cheryl (Robia Scott), the clear villain of the movie, tells Abby she needs to double the abortions her clinic provides so they can make more money. \u201c\u2018Nonprofit\u2019 is a tax status, not a business model!\u201d she tells Abby, comparing Planned Parenthood to a fast-food chain. Hamburgers don\u2019t bring in the big bucks, she explains in one scene. It\u2019s the soda and fries \u2015 or in this case, the abortion. \nPlanned Parenthood disputed this characterization in a statement to HuffPost, noting that it is a nonprofit that provides sexual and reproductive health care to millions of people across the country each year, many in underserved communities. The organization offers a wide breadth of services, including cancer screening, contraception and STD testing and treatment. Abortion makes up only 3.4 percent of its services, according to its most recent annual report.\u00a0\n\u201cThis idea that we would drum up business is silly,\u201d\u00a0Villavicencio said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a thing. Abortion has existed since we knew what pregnancy was, and it will not go away.\u201d\nWhile everyone\u2019s abortion is different, \u201cUnplanned\u201d presents the experience as an excruciatingly painful one. Women are seen crying out while insensitive doctors and nurses bark at them and hold them down. Blood \u2015 pooling in socks, dripping on floors \u2015 is a central motif.\nThe movie gives an inaccurate and fearmongering depiction of the procedure, Villavicencio said. \n\u201cMost people tolerate abortions throughout the first and second trimester very well,\u201d she said, adding that clinics use medications ranging from local anesthesia to deep sedation to manage pain. \nShe noted that abortions, for the most part, are exceptionally short procedures. \n\u201cThey last anywhere from three to 10 minutes,\u201d she said. \u201cI tell my patients: \u2018This may be intense for you, but it will last a short while and I will talk you through it and you will make it.\u2019\u201d \nIn \u201cUnplanned,\u201d a doctor accidentally perforates a teen girl\u2019s uterus while performing an abortion. As the girl goes into shock, the clinic workers decide not to call an ambulance because they\u2019re afraid of bad publicity. Instead, they lie to her father and give her drugs so she won\u2019t remember what happened.\nIn reality, serious complications during abortion are rare, and occur less frequently than during childbirth. In 2013, a total of 664,435 abortions were reported to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Only four women died as a result of complications that year.\n\u201cAbortion is one of the safest outpatient procedures that you can have in the U.S.,\u201d Villavicencio said. \u201cYou are less likely to have a complication than a colonoscopy or a wisdom tooth extraction.\u201d \nShe said it was comically offensive to suggest that an abortion clinic would jeopardize a patient\u2019s safety by refusing to call an ambulance during a medical emergency. \nThe abortion providers and staff in \u201cUnplanned\u201d are depicted as uncaring and inhumane. They crack jokes about dead babies, ignore patients who are visibly in pain and seem to lack even the most basic social manners.\nWhen Abby learns, while standing in the bathroom at work, that she is pregnant, her boss does not congratulate or hug her. Instead, she offers her an abortion. \u201cYou know, we could take care of that for you if you like,\u201d she spits. \nVillavicencio said she has had the opposite experience working at abortion clinics.\n\u201cOB-GYNs and family medicine doctors who do abortions are some of the most compassionate, empathetic people I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d she said. \u201cThey put themselves through discomfort \u2015 walking through protesters, getting threats, having sometimes the disdain of their own medical community \u2015 in order to provide this care.\u201d \nIn the movie, Abby claims that up to 75 percent of women will not show up at an abortion clinic if they see people praying outside. It comes across as a call to arms to the audience: Go to your local abortion provider and pray. \nVillavicencio raised doubts about the veracity of the statistic. Protesters pray outside her clinics every day, she said, and their no-show rate is not significantly affected. \n\u201cMight they convince people to change their minds? Sure,\u201d she said. \u201cIs that coercive and manipulative? In my opinion, yes.\u201d ", "date": "\n04/17/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/an-obgyn-debunks-unplanned-the-anti-abortion-movie_n_5cb74ff4e4b0ec270a4684bd", "tags": "planned villavicencio \u2018 loaded abby abortions movie \u201d lies abortion unplanned dangerous anti-abortion"}
