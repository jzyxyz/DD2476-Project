According to\u00a0The News & Observer,\u00a0Clinton also discussed the state\u2019s House Bill 2, which effectively bans transgender people from using the bathroom that best corresponds with their gender identity.\nBefore a packed crowd at Raleigh\u2019s Wake Tech Community College, Clinton called North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory\u2019s signing of the bill a \u201cvery mean-spirited, wrong-headed decision\u201d that has not only damaged the state\u2019s reputation, but also \u201churt people\u201d across the country.\u00a0\nWatch a short video clip of Clinton\u2019s speech below.\u00a0\nClinton went on to note that House Bill 2 \u201csent a message to so many people that, well, you know, you\u2019re not really wanted, you\u2019re not really part of us,\u201d before concluding,\u00a0\u201cI think the American Dream is big enough for everybody.\u201d\nWhile campaigning in the state earlier this month, Clinton called the bill \u201canother example of trying to discriminate against people that doesn\u2019t have any place in our modern society,\u201d according to The Washington Blade.\u00a0\n\u201cDiscrimination is not only wrong, it\u2019s bad for business,\u201d she said, pointing to the NBA\u2019s decision to relocate its 2017 All-Star Game from Charlotte to New Orleans over the law. Other businesses like PayPal, she added, had called off planned expansions in the state because \u201cthey don\u2019t want to be associated with the discriminatory, bigoted policies of your governor and legislature.\u201d\nShe previously shared her thoughts on the bill on Twitter, one day after McCrory signed it into law. \u00a0\nWhile Trump has touted himself as an inclusive candidate, LGBT voters aren\u2019t buying it.\u00a0A\u00a0NBC News/Survey Monkey Weekly Election Tracking Poll\u00a0released Monday found that 72 percent of registered LGBT voters support Clinton, compared to a mere 20 percent who back Trump.\u00a0", "date": "\n09/28/2016", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-north-carolina-bill_n_57ec08c6e4b024a52d2c41f6", "tags": "anti-lgbt hillary clinton presidential \u201d trump carolina called bill law state north monday blasts"}
