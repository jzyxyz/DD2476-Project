{"title": "Mario Batali Exits His Restaurants", "content": "The 20-year partnership between the celebrity chef Mario Batali and the Bastianich family of restaurateurs was formally dissolved on Wednesday, more than a year after several women accused Mr. Batali of sexual harassment and assault.\nMr. Batali \u201cwill no longer profit from the restaurants in any way, shape or form,\u201d said Tanya Bastianich Manuali, who will head day-to-day operations at a new company, as yet unnamed, created to replace the Batali & Bastianich Hospitality Group.\nThe new company will operate the group\u2019s remaining 16 restaurants under a new management and financial structure. Mrs. Bastianich Manuali and her brother, Joe Bastianich, have bought Mr. Batali\u2019s shares in all the restaurants. They would not discuss the terms of the buyout.\nMr. Batali is also selling his shares in Eataly, the fast-growing global chain of luxury Italian supermarkets. \u201cEataly is in the process of acquiring Mr. Batali\u2019s minority interest in Eataly USA,\u201d said Chris Giglio, a spokesman for that company. \nSeveral famous chefs and restaurateurs have recently been accused of sexual harassment, but Mr. Batali is the first to surrender all his restaurants.\nAt its peak, Batali & Bastianich encompassed dozens of restaurants and food businesses in the United States, Italy, Singapore and Hong Kong. Splashy restaurants like Babbo and Del Posto made celebrities of Mr. Batali and his primary partner, Mr. Bastianich. Two other partners added luster to the operation: the respected California chef Nancy Silverton and Lidia Bastianich, Mr. Bastianich\u2019s mother, the chef and owner of Felidia, in Manhattan, and a beloved authority on Italian cuisine. \nMs. Silverton and Ms. Bastianich will be partners in the new company, along with Mr. Bastianich and Mrs. Bastianich Manuali. The four will work together on corporate strategy, culture, talent development and oversight across the businesses.\nIn December 2017, news accounts of Mr. Batali\u2019s history of sexual aggression touched off police investigations, torpedoed his career and cast a shadow over all the restaurants he was involved in. Reservations at Del Posto, the group\u2019s luxurious Manhattan flagship, shrank as expense-account approvers shied away from Mr. Batali\u2019s compromised reputation. \nSix of the group\u2019s restaurants, in Las Vegas and East Asia, closed soon afterward, when the Sands casino group ended its contracts with Batali & Bastianich. Others shuttered as the process of dismantling the partnership dragged on. The group\u2019s newest restaurant, the ambitious and expensive La Sirena, in the meatpacking district of Manhattan, closed in December. \nSince the scandal began, Mr. Bastianich has insisted that he was unaware of Mr. Batali\u2019s sexual aggressions against women. In a statement on Tuesday, he said: \u201cWhile I never saw or heard of Mario groping an employee, I heard him say inappropriate things to our employees. Though I criticized him for it from time to time, I should have done more. I neglected my responsibilities as I turned my attention away from the restaurants. People were hurt, and for this I am deeply sorry.\u201d\nBut three former employees of the restaurant group, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of Mr. Bastianich\u2019s power in the restaurant business, said that they believed it was not possible that Mr. Bastianich remained ignorant of serious misbehavior by Mr. Batali. Throughout the industry, they and others have said, both men were known for fostering a sexist, raucous culture that ignored misconduct by male employees and demeaned female workers. (Before the #MeToo movement, however, that kind of atmosphere was hardly unique to Batali & Bastianich.)\nMr. Batali issued a statement on Wednesday morning: \u201cI have reached an agreement with Joe and no longer have any stake in the restaurants we built together. I wish him the best of luck in the future.\u201d He declined requests for further comment. \nBatali & Bastianich was not a holding company and had no ownership; it provided management services to all the restaurants in the group. Each restaurant was, and will remain, independently operated and financed by multiple parties. \nAs a result, Mr. Batali, 58, was never involved in Felidia or the Lidia\u2019s restaurants, in Pittsburgh and Kansas City. Ms. Silverton, 64, is involved only in the group\u2019s five California restaurants: Chi Spacca, Osteria Mozza and three variations on the Mozza theme. At Becco, which Mr. Bastianich opened in New York\u2019s theater district in 1992 after a short career as a bond trader, his grandmother, Erminia, is an investor. (She is now 101 years old, and has recouped her initial stake.)\nAlthough Mrs. Bastianich Manuali, who will run the newly created group, has never had a public role in Batali & Bastianich, she has long managed their mother\u2019s restaurants. She also co-wrote seven of her mother\u2019s cookbooks and has been a producer on her television series since 2006.\n\u201cI never planned to come back,\u201d said Mrs. Bastianich Manuali, who holds a doctorate in art history from Oxford University. \u201cThe pull of a family business can be strong.\u201d \nThe new agreement returns control of the restaurants to the family, who have been working together since the 1970s, when Lidia Bastianich and her husband, Felice Bastianich, opened their first Italian restaurants, in Queens. Their children helped out from the time they were old enough to fold napkins. (Felice Bastianich died in 2010.)\nNow, Mrs. Bastianich Manuali, 46, will be in charge of operations across the group, a position that did not exist before. \u201cWe need to blow the dust off,\u201d she said in an interview, gesturing to the battalion of elegantly uniformed servers at Del Posto. \u201cThese people have been living under a cloud long enough.\u201d \nAs part of the reorganization, Melissa Rodriguez, Del Posto\u2019s executive chef, and Jeff Katz, its longtime general manager, have become stakeholders in that restaurant, a precious reward that encourages loyalty and motivation. (The chefs Dave Pasternack at Esca in Midtown Manhattan and Andy Nusser at the three Tarry Lodge restaurants in Westchester and Connecticut already have ownership shares.) \nMs. Rodriguez was trained by her predecessor, Mark Ladner, Del Posto\u2019s original chef; she is the first woman other than Ms. Bastianich to hold that position in any of the group\u2019s New York restaurants. \n\u201cIt will be good not to be a black spot on the map any longer,\u201d Mr. Katz said.\nAsked whether she regretted opening the family business to Mr. Batali, Ms. Bastianich, 72, said only, \u201cEverything was done with the best intentions.\u201d\nMr. Bastianich, 50, did acknowledge regret about having spent much of the last decade away from the restaurants that he and Mr. Batali had opened together. His professional attention has shifted to Italy, where he has been a judge on nine seasons of the blockbuster cooking show \u201cMasterChef.\u201d He has vineyards in Friuli, a residence in Milan, and has appeared in Italian commercials for McDonald\u2019s and Alitalia.\nIn the early years of the partnership, Mr. Batali and Ms. Bastianich were the media stars, with Mr. Bastianich operating behind the scenes. \u201cAs a 200-pound bald guy I was in the shadow of Mario, in the shadow of my mom,\u201d he said. \nBut, he said, after he became a runner, then a marathoner, then a triathlete, he gained confidence \u2014 and opportunities for fame that took him elsewhere. \u201cI just wasn\u2019t around,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was a mistake.\u201d \nThe restaurants, most of them operating under longtime Batali & Bastianich chefs and managers, ran smoothly enough, except for some lawsuits over wages, tips and sexual harassment (not by Mr. Batali).\nWhen Mr. Batali and Mr. Bastianich met in 1993, Mr. Batali was the chef at tiny P\u00f3 in the West Village, where his loose, modern Italian dishes packed the house every night. Ms. Bastianich had introduced him to her son, who was equally passionate about Italian food, wine and late-night carousing. \nIn 1998, they opened Babbo, which was an immediate hit for its big-flavored food, classic rock playlist and energetic atmosphere. (With its Michelin star and longtime popularity, Babbo has been least affected by Mr. Batali\u2019s fall, Mr. Bastianich said.)\nNearly 20 years later, the business they built together began to implode in just two days, when The New York Times and Eater published back-to-back articles in which women described a longtime pattern of sexual harassment and assault by Mr. Batali. The most serious incidents were said to have taken place both at the group\u2019s restaurants and other places, including the Spotted Pig, in the West Village, where Mr. Batali was a regular and an investor. (Mr. Bastianich is also an investor in the Spotted Pig.)\n[Read more about the allegations of sexual harassment and assault by Mario Batali.]\nMr. Batali said he didn\u2019t recall all the reported episodes, but quickly apologized and stepped away from restaurant operations. He was fired from \u201cThe Chew,\u201d ABC\u2019s daily food-and-talk show, which was subsequently canceled. In January, New York police officials confirmed that the department had closed three investigations into sexual assault charges against him, for lack of evidence.\n[Read more about the police investigations here.]\nMr. Batali has made no public comments on the allegations since December 2017. After a few much-criticized moments back in the public eye, he is said to be living with his family at the house they own in northern Michigan.\nThe new restaurant group\u2019s first venture will be The Barish, a steakhouse in the newly restored Hollywood Roosevelt hotel in Los Angeles. The restaurant\u2019s name refers to Ms. Silverton\u2019s forebears, who were cattle ranchers in Saskatchewan, Canada, at the turn of the 20th century. \nFollow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest.
