{"title": "Obama Makes His Case on Iran Nuclear Deal", "content": "Only hours after the conclusion of an agreement with Iran to lift oil and financial sanctions in return for curbs on Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities, President Obama is a man who evinces no second thoughts whatsoever about the deal he struck. In a 45-minute interview in the Cabinet Room, the president kept stressing one argument: Don\u2019t judge me on whether this deal transforms Iran, ends Iran\u2019s aggressive behavior toward some of its Arab neighbors or leads to d\u00e9tente between Shiites and Sunnis. Judge me on one thing: Does this deal prevent Iran from breaking out with a nuclear weapon for the next 10 years and is that a better outcome for America, Israel and our Arab allies than any other alternative on the table?\nThe president made clear to me that he did not agree with my assessment in a column two weeks ago that we had not used all the leverage in our arsenal, or alliances, to prevent Iran from becoming a threshold nuclear power, by acquiring a complete independent enrichment infrastructure that has the potential to undermine the global nuclear nonproliferation regime. Personally, I want more time to study the deal, hear from the nonpartisan experts, listen to what the Iranian leaders tell their own people and hear what credible alternative strategies the critics have to offer. But the president certainly argued his case with a conviction and internal logic with which his critics and Congress will have to seriously contend.\n\u201cWe are not measuring this deal by whether it is changing the regime inside of Iran,\u201d said the president. \u201cWe\u2019re not measuring this deal by whether we are solving every problem that can be traced back to Iran, whether we are eliminating all their nefarious activities around the globe. We are measuring this deal \u2014 and that was the original premise of this conversation, including by Prime Minister Netanyahu \u2014 Iran could not get a nuclear weapon. That was always the discussion. And what I\u2019m going to be able to say, and I think we will be able to prove, is that this by a wide margin is the most definitive path by which Iran will not get a nuclear weapon, and we will be able to achieve that with the full cooperation of the world community and without having to engage in another war in the Middle East.\u201d\nTo sell this deal to a skeptical Congress, President Obama clearly has to keep his argument tight. But I suspect his legacy on this issue will ultimately be determined by whether the deal does, in the long run, help transform Iran, defuse the U.S.-Iran Cold War and curtail the spread of nuclear weapons in the Middle East \u2014 not foster their proliferation. That, though, will be a long time in determining. For the near term, the deal\u2019s merit will be judged on whether Iran implements the rollback of its nuclear enrichment capabilities to which it has agreed and whether the deeply intrusive international inspection system it has accepted can detect \u2014 and thereby deter \u2014 any cheating.\nHere are some highlights from the interview: Asked about whether we failed to use all of our leverage, including a credible threat of force, the president said: \u201cI think that criticism is misguided. Let\u2019s see exactly what we obtained. We have cut off every pathway for Iran to develop a nuclear weapon. The reason we were able to unify the world community around the most effective sanctions regime we\u2019ve ever set up, a sanction regime that crippled the Iranian economy and ultimately brought them to the table, was because the world agreed with us, that it would be a great danger to the region, to our allies, to the world, if Iran possessed a nuclear weapon. We did not have that kind of global consensus around the notion that Iran can\u2019t enjoy any nuclear power whatsoever. And as a member of the nonproliferation treaty, the NPT, their argument was, \u2018We\u2019re entitled to have a peaceful nuclear program.\u2019\n\u201cAnd what we were able to do,\u201d the president continued, \u201cis to say to them, \u2018Given your past behavior, given our strong suspicion and evidence that you made attempts to weaponize your nuclear program, given the destabilizing activities that you\u2019ve engaged in in the region and support for terrorism, it\u2019s not enough for us to trust when you say that you are only creating a peaceful nuclear program. You have to prove it to us.\u2019 And so this whole system that we built is not based on trust; it\u2019s based on a verifiable mechanism, whereby every pathway that they have is shut off.\u201d\nThe president argued that his approach grew out of the same strategic logic that Presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan used to approach the Soviet Union and China.\n\u201cYou know, I have a lot of differences with Ronald Reagan, but where I completely admire him was his recognition that if you were able to verify an agreement that [was negotiated] with the evil empire that was hellbent on our destruction and was a far greater existential threat to us than Iran will ever be,\u201d then it would be worth doing, Mr. Obama said. \u201cI had a lot of disagreements with Richard Nixon, but he understood there was the prospect, the possibility, that China could take a different path. You test these things, and as long as we are preserving our security capacity \u2014 as long as we are not giving away our ability to respond forcefully, militarily, where necessary to protect our friends and our allies \u2014 that is a risk we have to take. It is a practical, common-sense position. It\u2019s not na\u00efve; it\u2019s a recognition that if we can in fact resolve some of these differences, without resort to force, that will be a lot better for us and the people of that region.\u201d\nAsked if he believed that, given the depth of Iran\u2019s civil society, which in 2009 launched a \u201cgreen revolution\u201d challenging clerical rule, the forces there for greater integration with the world would be empowered by this deal, the president said:\n\u201cWith respect to Iran, it is a great civilization, but it also has an authoritarian theocracy in charge that is anti-American, anti-Israeli, anti-Semitic, sponsors terrorism, and there are a whole host of real profound differences that we [have with] them,\u201d said the president. \u201cAnd so, initially, we have a much more modest goal here, which is to make sure Iran does not have a nuclear weapon. \u2026\n\u201cWhat\u2019s interesting, if you look at what\u2019s happened over the last several months, is the [Iranian] opponents of this deal are the hard-liners and those who are most invested in Iran\u2019s sponsorship of terrorism, most invested in destabilizing Iran\u2019s neighbors, most virulently anti-American and anti-Israeli. And that should tell us something, because those hard-liners are invested in the status quo in which Iran is isolated, and they are empowered. They become the only game in town. Not just militarily they call the shots, but economically they\u2019re able to exploit the workarounds from sanctions in order to fatten themselves in a situation in which you have a different base of business people and commerce inside of Iran that may change how they think about the cost and benefits of these destabilizing activities.\n\u201cBut we\u2019re not counting on that,\u201d the president stressed, \u201cand that\u2019s the thing I want to emphasize, because even over the last several weeks and today, as we announce the deal, what\u2019s been striking to me is that, increasingly, the critics are shifting off the nuclear issue, and they\u2019re moving into, \u2018Well, even if the nuclear issue is dealt with, they\u2019re still going to be sponsoring terrorism, and they\u2019re going to get this sanctions relief. And so they\u2019re going to have more money to engage in these bad activities.\u2019 That is a possibility, and we are going to have to systematically guard against that and work with our allies \u2014 the gulf countries, Israel \u2014 to stop the work that they are doing outside of the nuclear program. But the central premise here is that if they got a nuclear weapon, that would be different, and on that score, we have achieved our objective.\u201d\nAsked if President Vladimir Putin of Russia was a help or a hindrance in concluding this deal, Mr. Obama said: \u201cRussia was a help on this. I\u2019ll be honest with you. I was not sure given the strong differences we are having with Russia right now around Ukraine, whether this would sustain itself. Putin and the Russian government compartmentalized on this in a way that surprised me, and we would have not achieved this agreement had it not been for Russia\u2019s willingness to stick with us and the other P5-Plus members in insisting on a strong deal.\n\u201cI was encouraged by the fact that Mr. Putin called me a couple of weeks ago and initiated the call to talk about Syria. I think they get a sense that the Assad regime is losing a grip over greater and greater swaths of territory inside of Syria [to Sunni jihadist militias] and that the prospects for a [Sunni jihadist] takeover or rout of the Syrian regime is not imminent but becomes a greater and greater threat by the day. That offers us an opportunity to have a serious conversation with them.\u201d\nMy biggest concern and that of many serious critics who would actually like to see a deal work is that Iran is just not afraid of a serious U.S. military retaliation if it cheats. I asked the president, Why should the Iranians be afraid of us?\n\u201cBecause we could knock out their military in speed and dispatch if we chose to,\u201d he said, \u201cand I think they have seen my willingness to take military action where I thought it was important for U.S. interests. Now, I actually believe that they are interested in trying to operate on parallel levels to be able to obtain the benefits of international legitimacy, commerce, reduction of sanctions while still operating through proxies in destructive ways around the region. That\u2019s been their pattern, and I think it is very important to us to make sure that we are surfacing what they do through their proxies and calling them into account. That is part of the conversation we have to have with the gulf countries.\u201d\nWith such a crowded pool of Republican presidential candidates competing over the right-wing base, it seems unlikely the president will get much support for this deal from G.O.P. members of Congress.\n\u201dI think it\u2019s doubtful that we get a lot of current Republican elected officials supporting this deal,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cI think there\u2019s a certain party line that has to be toed, within their primaries and among many sitting members of Congress. But that\u2019s not across the board. It\u2019ll be interesting to see what somebody like a Rand Paul has to say about this. But I think that if I were succeeded by a Republican president \u2014 and I\u2019ll be doing everything that I can to prevent that from happening \u2014 but if I were, that Republican president would be in a much stronger position than I was when I came into office, in terms of constraining Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\n\u201cHe will be in a position to know that 98 percent of their nuclear material has been shipped out. He would know that the majority of the centrifuges had been removed. He would know that there is no heavy reactor there. He\u2019d know that the international community had signed on to this. He would know everything that we\u2019ve learned from the inspection regime. And he\u2019d still be in possession of the entire arsenal of our armed forces, and our diplomatic and intelligence services, to deal with the possibility that Iran was cheating. ... They\u2019re not going to admit that now. And that\u2019s entire hypothetical, because I feel good about having a Democratic successor. But I think that this builds on bipartisan ideas, bipartisan efforts. We could not have succeeded without the strong support of Congress on a bipartisan basis to impose the sanctions we did on Iran. They deserve enormous credit for that. And as we implement this I think it will prove to be not just good for us but good for the world.\u201d\nThe president spoke to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel by phone just before the start of the interview. Mr. Obama did not try to sugar coat their differences, but he hinted that his administration has in the works some significant strategic upgrades for both Israel and America\u2019s gulf allies.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate for me to discuss specific details about security agreements or work that we may be doing,\u201d the president told me. \u201cWhat I can tell you is that that process is in train. Now, with respect to the Israelis, I think it\u2019s fair to say that under my administration, we\u2019ve done more to facilitate Israeli capabilities. And I\u2019ve also said that I\u2019m prepared to go further than any other administration\u2019s gone before in terms of providing them additional security assurances from the United States. The thing I want to emphasize is that people\u2019s concerns here are legitimate. Hezbollah has tens of thousands of missiles that are pointed toward Israel. They are becoming more sophisticated. The interdiction of those weapon flows has not been as successful as it needs to be. There are legitimate concerns on the part of the gulf countries about Iran trying to stir up and prompt destabilizing events inside their countries. So they\u2019re not just being paranoid. Iran is acting in an unconstructive way, in a dangerous way in these circumstances. What I\u2019ve simply said is that we have to keep our eye on the ball here, which is that Iran with a nuclear weapon will do more damage, and we will be in a much worse position to prevent it.\u201d\nThe president argues that preventing Iran from having any enrichment capacity is simply impossible. The key, he insists, is how well you curb it and verify its limitations: \u201cNow, Prime Minister Netanyahu would prefer, and many of the critics would prefer, that they don\u2019t even have any nuclear capacity. But really, what that involves is eliminating the presence of knowledge inside of Iran. Nuclear technology is not that complicated today, and so the notion that the yardstick for success was now whether they ever had the capacity possibly to obtain nuclear weapons \u2014 that can\u2019t be the yardstick. The question is, Do we have the kind of inspection regime and safeguards and international consensus whereby it\u2019s not worth it for them to do it? We have accomplished that.\u201d\nThe president said he knows he is going to have a fight on his hands with Mr. Netanyahu and those in Congress who share the prime minister\u2019s views, but he seemed confident that in the end he would prevail.\nMr. Netanyahu, Mr. Obama said, \u201cperhaps thinks he can further influence the congressional debate, and I\u2019m confident we\u2019re going to be able to uphold this deal and implement it without Congress preventing that. But after that\u2019s done, if that\u2019s what he thinks is appropriate, then I will sit down, as we have consistently throughout my administration, and then ask some very practical questions: How do we prevent Hezbollah from acquiring more sophisticated weapons? How do we build on the success of Iron Dome, which the United States worked with Israel to develop and has saved Israeli lives? In the same way I\u2019m having conversation with the gulf countries about how do we have a more effective interdiction policy, how do we build more effective governance structures and military structures in Sunni areas that have essentially become a void that [the Islamic State] has filled or that, in some cases, Iranian activities can exploit?\u201d\nThe president added: \u201cAnd what I\u2019ve also tried to explain to people, including Prime Minister Netenyahu, is that in the absence of a deal, our ability to sustain these sanctions was not in the cards. Keep in mind it\u2019s not just Iran that paid a price for sanctions. China, Japan, South Korea, India \u2014 pretty much any oil importer around the world that had previously import arrangements from Iran \u2014 found themselves in a situation where this was costing them billions of dollars to sustain these sanctions.\n\u201cIn some ways, the United States paid the lowest price for maintenance of sanctions, because we didn\u2019t do business with Iran in the first place. They made a significant sacrifice. The reason they did was because my administration, our diplomats, and oftentimes me personally, were able to persuade them that the only way to resolve this nuclear problem was to make these sanctions bite. And if they saw us walking away from what technical experts believe is a legitimate mechanism to ensure that Iran does not have a nuclear weapon \u2014 if they saw that our diplomatic efforts were not sincere, or were trying to encompass not just the nuclear program, but every policy disagreement that we might have with Iran, then frankly, those sanctions would start falling apart very rapidly. And so, maybe Iran wouldn\u2019t get $150 billion, but they\u2019d get a big chunk of that, because we would not be able to sustain that support.\u201d\nIt strikes me that the one party that we have heard the least from, but in the end could count the most, is the Iranian people and how they ultimately react to this opening of Iran to the world as a result of this deal. What would Mr. Obama say to them?\n\u201cWhat I\u2019d say to them is this offers a historic opportunity,\u201d the president said. \u201cTheir economy has been cratering as a consequence of the sanctions. They have the ability now to take some decisive steps to move toward a more constructive relationship with the world community. \u2026 They need to seize that opportunity, their leaders need to seize that opportunity. And the truth of the matter is that Iran will be and should be a regional power. They are a big country and a sophisticated country in the region. They don\u2019t need to invite the hostility and the opposition of their neighbors by their behavior. It\u2019s not necessary for them to be great to denigrate Israel or threaten Israel or engage in Holocaust denial or anti-Semitic activity. Now that\u2019s what I would say to the Iranian people. Whether the Iranian people have sufficient influence to fundamentally shift how their leaders think about these issues, time will tell.\u201d\nMaybe, I suggested, it was time for the U.S. to launch a new peace process \u2014 between Sunni Arab Saudi Arabia and Shiite Persian Iran. After all, without some lowering of tensions between the two any empowerment of Iran is only going to increase tensions between these two historic rivals, whose internecine war is tearing the region apart.\n\u201cI have long believed that we have to encourage at least a lessening of the hostilities that currently exist between Shia and Sunni factions in the region,\u201d Mr. Obama responded. \u201cNow, I think when I talked to my gulf allies when we were at Camp David, they\u2019d be very clear in saying that \u2018We view ourselves as Arab nations, not Sunni and Shia,\u2019 and I think they mean that sincerely. And many of them would say that our Shia citizens are full citizens and are treated fairly, but what I think is undeniable is that the sectarian forces that have been unleashed are adding to the viciousness and destructiveness of what\u2019s happening in a place like Syria, what\u2019s happening in a place like Yemen, what\u2019s happening certainly in Iraq. And that our best chance at at least reducing the scope of those conflicts is for the Saudis and other Sunni states or Arab states to be at least in a practical conversation with Iran that says, `The conflict we are fanning right now could engulf us all in flames.\u2019\n\u201cNobody has an interest in seeing [the Islamic State] control huge swaths of territory between Damascus and Baghdad. That\u2019s not good for Iran. It makes it very difficult for them to sustain a buffer, which has always been a significant motivator for them since the Iraq-Iran War. It\u2019s not good for the Saudis. It leaves them vulnerable in all sorts of ways, and the truth of the matter is that, most importantly, it\u2019s not good for the people there. You watch the news reports preceding the Arab Spring, but certainly since the Arab Spring started to turn into more an Arab Winter, and you weep for the children of this region, not just the ones who are being displaced in Syria, not just the ones who are currently suffering from humanitarian situations in Yemen, but just the ordinary Iranian youth or Saudi youth or Kuwaiti youth who are asking themselves, `Why is it that we don\u2019t have the same prospects that some kid in Finland, Singapore, China, Indonesia, the United States? Why aren\u2019t we seeing that same possibility, that same sense of hopefulness?\u2019 And I think that\u2019s what the leaders have to really focus on.\u201d\nThe president also said: \u201cAmerica has to listen to our Sunni Arab allies, but also not fall into the trap of letting them blame every problem on Iran. The citizens of more than a few Arab Gulf states have been big contributors to Sunni Jihadist movements that have been equally destabilizing.\n\u201cIn some cases, for example, the Houthis in Yemen, I think Iranian involvement has been initially overstated,\u201d said Mr. Obama. \u201cWhen we see our intelligence, we don\u2019t get a sense that Iran was strategically thinking, \u2018Let\u2019s march the Houthis into Sana.\u2019 It was more of an indicator of the weakness of the government in Yemen. They now seek to exploit it. Oftentimes, they\u2019re opportunistic. That\u2019s part of the reason why my argument has been to my allies in the region, let\u2019s stop giving Iran opportunities for mischief. Strengthen your own societies. Be inclusive. Make sure that your Shia populations don\u2019t feel as if they\u2019re being left out. Think about the economic growth. Make sure that we\u2019ve got better military capacity for things like interdiction. The more we do those things, that\u2019s the level of deterrence that\u2019s necessary because it is highly unlikely that you are going to see Iran launch a direct attack, state to state, against any of our allies in the region. They know that that would give us the rationale to go in full-bore, and as I said, we could knock out most of their military capacity pretty quickly.\u201d\nI noted to Mr. Obama that one of the issues most troubling nonpartisan critics of the deal is what happens if we suspect that Iran is operating a covert nuclear program at a military base not covered by this deal. There is a process in place that allows for inspections, but it could take over three weeks for international inspectors to get access after raising a complaint. Couldn\u2019t Iran use that time to just scrub clean any signs of cheating?\n\u201cYeah, but here\u2019s where having somebody like [Energy Secretary] Ernie Moniz is pretty helpful, because he assured us that if, in fact, we have good mechanisms to scoop up and sample earth, this stuff has got a long half-life. My high school physics probably isn\u2019t equal to Ernie Moniz\u2019s, but I do remember it\u2019s not that easy to suddenly just hide potentially radioactive material that\u2019s been developed. The same is true, by the way, for the possibility that Iran might import materials that could be used for nuclear programs but might have a dual use. We\u2019ve set up unprecedented mechanisms to be able to look at each one of those imports and say, \u2018You got to show us how this is being used to ensure that it\u2019s not being converted.\u2019 \u201d\nThe president added: \u201cIf you hear a critic say, `Well, this inspection regime is not 100 percent foolproof,\u2019 I guess theoretically, nothing is 100 percent foolproof. But if the standard is what is the best, most effective, most rigorous mechanism whereby it is very, very, very difficult for Iran to cheat, then this is the mechanism, and it goes far beyond anything that was done, for example, in North Korea.\u201d\nIn conclusion, I noted to Mr. Obama that he was now the U.S. president who\u2019d had the most contact with Iran\u2019s leadership since the 1979 Islamic Revolution there and the onset of the U.S.-Iran Cold War. What had he learned?\n\u201cWell, I haven\u2019t learned yet to trust the Iranian leadership,\u201d said Mr. Obama, \u201calthough I think that what John Kerry learned in his interactions with Foreign Minister Zarif \u2014 and that then traces back to President Rouhani \u2014 is that when you nail down an agreement, they do seem to follow it to the letter, perhaps thinking there may be a loophole here or there, which is why you have to button this stuff down. But the notion that once you put something down on paper that somehow they\u2019re just going to ignore it and try to pocket what they\u2019ve gained, that\u2019s not what we saw during the last two years of the interim agreement. There is, I think, restraints that they feel when they have an agreement and they have a document, that they need to abide by it. So I think we\u2019ve learned that.\n\u201cI think that we\u2019ve also learned that there are different voices and different forces inside of Iran, and that those may not be consistent with our values. The so-called moderate in Iran is not going to be suddenly somebody who we feel reflects universal issues like human rights, but there are better or worse approaches that Iran can take relative to our interests and the interests of our allies, and we should see where we can encourage that better approach.\n\u201cAnd then I think the last thing that \u2014 this is maybe not something I\u2019ve learned but has been confirmed \u2014 even with your enemies, even with your adversaries, I do think that you have to have the capacity to put yourself occasionally in their shoes, and if you look at Iranian history, the fact is that we had some involvement with overthrowing a democratically elected regime in Iran. We have had in the past supported Saddam Hussein when we know he used chemical weapons in the war between Iran and Iraq, and so, as a consequence, they have their own security concerns, their own narrative. It may not be one we agree with. It in no way rationalizes the kinds of sponsorship from terrorism or destabilizing activities that they engage in, but I think that when we are able to see their country and their culture in specific terms, historical terms, as opposed to just applying a broad brush, that\u2019s when you have the possibility at least of some movement.\n\u201cIn the same way that when Ronald Reagan and others negotiated arms agreement with the Soviet Union, you had to recognize, yes, this is an evil, terrible system, but within it are people with specific historic ideas and memories, and we have to be able to understand those things and potentially try to make some connection. And the same was true with respect to Nixon and Kissinger going to China, which ended up being a very important strategic benefit to the United States.\u201d", "date": "July 14, 2015", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/opinion/thomas-friedman-obama-makes-his-case-on-iran-nuclear-deal.html", "tags": "iran think nuclear makes \u201d obama case \u2014 deal said"}
