{"title": "1 Year After Obamacare Repeal Vote, GOP Has Largely Dropped The Cause", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2015 One year ago, President Donald Trump and House Republicans gathered in the Rose Garden for a victory ceremony. Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) had just shepherded through a bill repealing major parts of the Affordable Care Act, moving them a step closer to their promise of undoing President Barack Obama\u2019s signature legislative achievement.\u00a0\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to talk about this unbelievable victory \u2014 wasn\u2019t it unbelievable? So we don\u2019t have to say it again. But it\u2019s going to be an unbelievable victory, actually, when we get it through the Senate,\u201d Trump boasted, standing in front of beaming House members.\u00a0\nSince Obamacare\u2019s passage in 2010, Republicans had made repealing it their central campaign promise. If the country handed control of Congress and the White House to the GOP, they would finally dismantle it.\nIn 2016, they got their wish. But they still couldn\u2019t get the job done. The Senate never passed the House repeal legislation.\u00a0Public opinion swung in favor of the law, and many of the House members who took the tough vote to advance repeal now find themselves on the defensive at home.\u00a0\nThe uneasiness the GOP feels with Obamacare repeal is borne out by the money candidates and other groups are spending on TV ads. In the past, Republicans walloped Democrats on the air with ads mentioning Obamacare, according to an analysis by Kantar Media/CMAG for HuffPost.\nBut in the 2018 cycle, the numbers aren\u2019t quite as stark. Conservatives are still spending more on anti-Obamacare ads \u2015 and airing more spots on the issue \u2015 but Democrats aren\u2019t nearly as far behind as in the past.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not just that Republicans are less interested in talking about the issue \u2015 it\u2019s also that Democrats are finally feeling emboldened.\u00a0\n\u201cWe see health care as the defining issue of the 2018 midterms,\u201d said David Bergstein, spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. \u201cThe Republican health care agenda is incredibly toxic with voters of every political persuasion.\u201d\nFor the first time in an election cycle since Obamacare\u2019s passage, a majority of the public now approves of the health care law. Democrats now have a sizable advantage over the GOP on the issue, and candidates frequently bring up their support for Obamacare while meeting with voters.\u00a0\nTwenty-three million fewer Americans would have had insurance under legislation that the House Republicans narrowly passed, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\u00a0\nEven though outright repeal appears to be off the table, there are still efforts to undermine the law. The big GOP tax bill eliminated the financial penalty for people who don\u2019t get insurance. Without that penalty in place, healthy people are less likely to buy insurance, causing premiums for those who keep insurance to rise. \u00a0", "date": "\n05/04/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/obama-repeal-ads_n_5aeb5310e4b041fd2d2459ab", "tags": "care dropped cause obamacare democrats issue repeal gop largely house \u2015 insurance year republicans vote"}
