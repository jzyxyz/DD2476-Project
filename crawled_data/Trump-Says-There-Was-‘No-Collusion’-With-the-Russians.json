Rosenstein, said that he had written his memo recommending the firing of James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, after learning that President Trump intended to fire him.\nPresident Trump insisted that there was no collusion between his presidential campaign and Russian officials, though he added, \u201cI can only speak for myself.\u201d\nMr. Trump, speaking in the East Room of the White House, said he respected the appointment of a special counsel to investigate ties with Russia.\n\u201cThe entire thing has been a witch hunt,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThere\u2019s no collusion between, certainly, myself and my campaign \u2014 but I can only speak for myself \u2014 and the Russians \u2014 zero.\u201d\nThe president said the questions surrounding his campaign and Russia were divisive.\n\u201cI think it divides the country,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI think we have a very divided country because of that and many other things.\u201d\nRead more from The Times\u2019s Mark Landler and Glenn Thrush \u00bb\nMr. Rosenstein told senators that he knew President Trump planned to fire Mr. Comey as director of the F.B.I. before Mr. Rosenstein wrote a memo outlining the reasons for his dismissal, according to three Democratic lawmakers who were in the briefing.\nThe meeting with senators came a day after Mr. Rosenstein appointed a special counsel to take over the federal investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the presidential election and whether any campaign associates of Mr. Trump aided the Russians.\nSenators Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Richard J. Durbin of Illinois and Christopher S. Murphy of Connecticut, all Democrats, told reporters immediately after the briefing that Mr. Rosenstein had said Mr. Trump\u2019s decision was made before reviewing a memo that was prepared by the Justice Department.\n\u201cThere are a lot of missing pieces,\u201d Mr. Durbin said, noting Mr. Rosenstein had left many questions unanswered, specifically regarding what Mr. Trump had said on May 8, and what part Attorney General Jeff Sessions may have played in the decision.\nRead more from The Times\u2019s Matthew Rosenberg and Rebecca R. Ruiz \u00bb\nDuring a brief photo opportunity with Mr. Santos in the Oval Office, the president said he was \u201cvery close\u201d to choosing a new F.B.I. director.\nAsked if Joseph I. Lieberman, the former senator from Connecticut, was among the finalists for the job, he answered with an emphatic \u201cyes.\u201d\nSpeaking to reporters after the meeting with Mr. Rosenstein, Ms. McCaskill indirectly criticized Mr. Lieberman\u2019s candidacy for the job. \u201cWe need a law enforcement professional that\u2019s never campaigned for political office,\u201d she said.\nBut Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas who was himself under consideration to replace Mr. Comey until this week, expressed support for Mr. Lieberman for the job. \u201cEverybody keeps saying we need an independent F.B.I. director,\u201d Mr. Cornyn said.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a registered independent. How much more independent can you get?\u201d\n\u2014 Rebecca Ruiz on Capitol Hill\nSenator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, said that he and some of his colleagues were \u201csomewhat unsatisfied\u201d that Mr. Rosenstein was not more forthcoming. The senator said he saw no reason that Mr. Rosenstein could not deliver equivalent comments in open session on Capitol Hill.\n\u201cI see virtually nothing that he said in this closed setting that he could not tell the American people under oath in public, in the Judiciary Committee,\u201d said Mr. Blumenthal, a member of the committee.\nWhen pressed, Mr. Blumenthal said that Mr. Rosenstein \u201cdidn\u2019t refuse\u201d the invitation but did not accept it either.\n\u2014 Matt Flegenheimer on Capitol Hill\nMr. Rosenstein\u2019s closed briefing with senators ended around 3:15 p.m., and some of the attendees stopped to talk to reporters afterward.\n\u201cIt was a counterintelligence investigation before now,\u201d Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said after he exited the briefing. \u201cI think it\u2019s now being considered a criminal investigation.\u201d\nMr. Graham said Mr. Mueller, in his new role as special counsel, was likely to \u201cjealously guard\u201d information. \u201cOne of the big losers in this discussion is the public,\u201d he said. He called Mr. Trump\u2019s selection as the new F.B.I. director \u201cone of the winners,\u201d for not having to worry about the inquiry.\nSeveral senators said Mr. Rosenstein would give Mr. Mueller wide berth in the inquiry.\n\u201cHe is very comfortable allowing Mueller to take the investigation as far and as deep, as wide as necessary,\u201d said Senator Tim Scott, Republican of South Carolina.\nMr. Rosenstein gave Mr. Mueller leeway to investigate everything related to Russian interference in the election, said Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota. \u201cKind of the whole gamut,\u201d he said.\nSenator Bob Casey, Democrat of Pennsylvania, made it clear that Mr. Rosenstein had not alleviated all of their concerns during the roughly hourlong briefing, though. \u201cWe still have questions,\u201d he said.\n\u2014 Rebecca Ruiz and Emmarie Huetteman on Capitol Hill\nThe top Republican and Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee said on Thursday that they, too, had asked the Justice Department and the F.B.I. for more documents related to the investigation into Russian election meddling \u2014 including the so-called Comey memo detailing discussions between Mr. Trump and Mr. Comey.\nThe committee\u2019s statement noted that the request was made on Wednesday. Add it to the pile: The Senate Intelligence Committee and the House Oversight Committee were among the congressional panels that made similar requests, though they also asked Mr. Comey to testify.\n\u2014 Emmarie Huetteman on Capitol Hill\nMr. Trump lashed out on Thursday morning, saying he was the target of an unprecedented witch hunt.\nIn a pair of early morning posts on Twitter, Mr. Trump cited, without evidence, what he called the \u201cillegal acts\u201d committed by the administration of his predecessor, Barack Obama, and the campaign of his former opponent, Hillary Clinton \u2014 and said they never led to the appointment of a special counsel.\n\u201cWith all of the illegal acts that took place in the Clinton campaign & Obama Administration, there was never a special councel appointed!\u201d Mr. Trump wrote, misspelling counsel.\nMoments later, Mr. Trump added, \u201cThis is the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history!\u201d\nRead more from The Times\u2019s Mark Landler \u00bb\nSeveral White House advisers and personal associates of Mr. Trump have urged him to hire an experienced outside lawyer to help him deal with issues arising the surging Russia controversy, according to several people briefed on the conversations.\nThe recommendations came even before a special counsel was named on Wednesday to lead the investigation into any collusion between the Trump presidential campaign and Russian officials.\nRead more from The Times\u2019s Maggie Haberman \u00bb\nThe president learned of Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s decision around 5:35 p.m. on Wednesday when the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, walked into the Oval Office to tell him.\nMr. Trump, who was looking through papers, reacted calmly but defiantly at first, according to two people familiar with the events, saying he wanted to \u201cfight back.\u201d Realizing the seriousness of the situation, he quickly summoned his staff, including Sean Spicer, the press secretary; Michael Dubke, the communications director; Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner; Reince Priebus, the chief of staff; Hope Hicks, a longtime aide; Kellyanne Conway, a senior adviser; and Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist.\nMost of those gathered recommended that the president adopt a conciliatory stance and release a statement accepting Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s decision and embracing a swift investigation that would clear the cloud of suspicion hovering over the West Wing.\nMr. Kushner \u2014 who had urged Mr. Trump to fire Mr. Comey \u2014 was one of the few dissenting voices, urging the president to counterattack, according to two senior administration officials. After a brief discussion, however, calmer heads prevailed, and Mr. Trump\u2019s staff huddled over a computer just outside the Oval Office to draft the statement that was ultimately released, asserting the president\u2019s innocence and determination to move on.\nBy the end of the process, Mr. Trump was calm, determined to push his agenda and uncharacteristically noncombative, according to people close to the president.\n\u2014 Glenn Thrush in Washington\n\u25a0 Mr. Mueller, as head of the F.B.I. for 13 years and as a federal prosecutor, cultivated a reputation as an unflinching advocate for facts.\n\u25a0 Weeks before Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, Michael T. Flynn is said to have told the transition team that he was being investigated for working as a paid lobbyist for Turkey. But he was named national security adviser anyway, giving him wide access to American intelligence.\n\u25a0 Joseph I. Lieberman, the former senator from Connecticut, was one of four people the president interviewed as a potential F.B.I. director.\n\u25a0 The S. & P. 500 and the Dow both took a dive, falling 1.8 percent each as investors appeared shaken by the drama around Mr. Trump.\n\u25a0 In the conservative news media, Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters have used unfounded allegations, diversions and conspiracies to keep his troops behind him.\n\u25a0 The president has groused to friends that he is not looking forward to his first foreign trip in office, and his preparation has been hit-or-miss.", "date": "May 18, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/18/us/politics/trump-fbi-mueller-rosenstein.html", "tags": "\u25a0 \u2018 russians f.b.i \u201c rosenstein collusion trump says \u2014 said"}
