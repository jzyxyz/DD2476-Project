{"title": "Trump Says Abandoning Iran Deal Has Already Curbed Tehran\u2019s Bad Behavior", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump asserted Thursday that his decision to abandon the Iran nuclear deal had already curbed Iran\u2019s aggressive behavior, and he predicted that his hard-nosed tactics would also result in a successful nuclear negotiation with North Korea.\nIran, he said, was no longer as adventurous in Syria and Yemen, and had relaxed its ambitions to extend its influence all the way to the Mediterranean Sea. \u201cIran is not the same country that it was a few months ago,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a news conference, five days before he was scheduled to meet in Singapore with Kim Jong-un of North Korea.\n\u201cThey\u2019re a much, much different group of leaders,\u201d he concluded.\nMr. Trump cited no evidence to support his contention. Iran remains firmly under the control of its theocratic government, it continues to support proxy forces across the Middle East, and it just announced plans to increase its capacity to enrich uranium after Mr. Trump\u2019s withdrawal.\nStill, the president said his willingness to walk away from the Iran deal would set the right tone for his negotiations with Mr. Kim over North Korea\u2019s nuclear program. Mr. Trump pointed out that he had already walked away from the Singapore meeting once \u2014 a decision he reversed after 24 hours when the Kim government issued a conciliatory response.\n\u201cI hope it won\u2019t be necessary to walk because I really believe that Kim Jong-un wants to do something,\u201d Mr. Trump said, standing in the Rose Garden alongside Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan. \u201cI believe we\u2019re going to have a terrific success or a modified success.\u201d\nDepending on the degree of success, the president said, he could foresee inviting Mr. Kim to a follow-up meeting at the White House. And he left open the possibility of signing a peace declaration that would formally end the Korean War after nearly seven decades of military hostilities.\nMr. Trump, however, acknowledged that this would be only the start of a protracted, difficult negotiation over North Korea\u2019s nuclear program. \u201cThat\u2019s probably the easy part,\u201d he said of announcing a peace treaty.\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said later that while the United States understood North Korea could not give us up its nuclear arsenal \u201cinstantaneously,\u201d the process needed to be \u201cbig and bold\u201d and not open-ended. \u201cWe can\u2019t step through this over years,\u201d he said.\nThe debate over how to negotiate with North Korea has exposed a rift in the administration, between Mr. Pompeo, who strongly backs Mr. Trump\u2019s diplomatic gambit, and the national security adviser, John R. Bolton, who nearly derailed the meeting last month by proposing Libya, and its voluntary disarmament under Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in 2003, as a model for North Korea.\nSpeaking to reporters at the White House, Mr. Pompeo at first dismissed reports of a rift as \u201cfiction,\u201d before conceding, \u201cAmbassador Bolton and I will disagree with great, great consistency over time, I\u2019m confident, right? We\u2019re two individuals. We\u2019re each going to present our views.\u201d\nMr. Trump\u2019s enthusiasm for a meeting with Mr. Kim has remained constant, even though he briefly canceled the encounter in response to a series of hostile statements by the North Koreans.\nEarlier Thursday, the president said he did not think the meeting required a great deal of preparation on his part. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a question of preparation,\u201d he told reporters in the Oval Office. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of whether people want it to happen.\u201d\nFor Mr. Abe, the visit amounted to a last-ditch effort to stiffen Mr. Trump\u2019s spine before he flies to Singapore. Mr. Trump\u2019s more conciliatory tone in the past few days has alarmed the Japanese, who worry that he might trade the security of the United States\u2019 Asian allies for a deal with Mr. Kim on nuclear weapons.\nMr. Trump has stepped back from his demand that North Korea give up its entire nuclear arsenal immediately, calling it a \u201cprocess.\u201d He also said he would stop using the phrase \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d to describe the sanctions against the North, even though he insisted that they would remain in place.\nMr. Abe has been on edge since March, when Mr. Trump accepted Mr. Kim\u2019s offer to meet. In April, the Japanese leader flew to the president\u2019s estate in Palm Beach, Fla., for two days of meetings, after which Mr. Trump pledged to raise the plight of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea \u2014 an issue with great domestic political resonance for Mr. Abe.\nBut Mr. Trump did not single out North Korea\u2019s short- and medium-range missiles, which threaten Japan but not the continental United States. Some Japanese analysts worry that he could make a deal with Mr. Kim that curbs its intercontinental ballistic missiles \u2014 protecting the United States \u2014 while leaving intact its shorter-range missiles.\nIn a sign of how large North Korea has loomed, Mr. Abe said it dominated his talks with Mr. Trump, even though the United States has moved ahead with tariffs on Japanese steel \u2014 precipitating the most bitter trade clash between Tokyo and Washington in years.\n\u201cDonald, President Trump, you are about to make a new history,\u201d Mr. Abe said through a translator.\nMr. Trump has long drawn a link between Iran and North Korea. When he announced last month that he would reimpose sanctions on Iran \u2014 effectively pulling the United States out of the deal negotiated by President Barack Obama \u2014 he told European leaders that his move would help pave the way for a successful negotiation with North Korea.\nExperts, however, point out that North Korea and Iran are very different countries \u2014 one a reclusive state with a sprawling nuclear program and dozens of bombs, the other a threshold nuclear state with no bombs yet, but a web of interests and proxy forces across the Middle East.\nAnalysts said they were puzzled by Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that his abandonment of the Iran deal had so quickly changed its behavior. If anything, Iran has seized on the fact that the deal\u2019s other signatories have stuck with it as a way to divide the United States from its allies.\nYet some experts, in trying to interpret Mr. Trump\u2019s comments, pointed to Israel\u2019s recent military strike on Iranian forces in Syria, the pullout of foreign companies from Iran, and the deepening woes of the Iranian economy as signs of how Iran\u2019s position has weakened in the past few weeks.\n\u201cBefore we pulled out of the Iran deal, Iran\u2019s leadership was arrogant and on the march,\u201d said Mark Dubowitz, the chief executive of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and a longtime critic of the deal. \u201cWhat I think he means is that he\u2019s cut them down to size.\u201d", "date": "June 7, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/07/world/asia/trump-abe-japan-korea-kim.html", "tags": "iran curbed korea already abandoning tehran \u201d trump says bad north \u2014 behavior deal"}
