{"title": "The 5 Victims of the Capital Gazette Newsroom Shooting in Annapolis", "content": "A nimble writer of editorials. A columnist with a keen eye. A jack-of-all trades reporter. A kind, young sales assistant. And a dedicated community chronicler.\nThe five victims of a shooting on Thursday afternoon at the Capital Gazette newsroom in Annapolis, Md., held a wide range of roles at the newspaper. The youngest was 34. The oldest was 65.\n[Read our coverage of the Annapolis shooting here.]\nTom Marquardt, a former executive editor and publisher of the The Capital who came to the newspaper in the 1970s and retired in 2012, knew and worked with four of the victims and said that they all shared a dedication to the newspaper. Their decision to remain there despite the adversity it faced, he said, \u201csays something about their love of journalism.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what makes the tragedy all that much worse,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are people who just stayed there and never expected that something like this would happen.\u201d\nGerald Fischman was the editorial page editor for The Capital, according to a biography on the newspaper\u2019s website. He had been an editorial writer for the paper since 1992.\nMr. Marquardt described Mr. Fischman as the \u201cperfect editorial writer\u201d \u2014 one who could take five imperfect bullet points from overzealous editors and publishers and transform those thoughts into a sharp, intelligent and fair editorial.\nAlways showing up to the office in a tie and a cardigan sweater, Mr. Fischman was a sort of shy, \u201cnerdy guy\u201d who had tried out for \u201cJeopardy!\u201d twice.\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember a time that he had to correct anything he wrote in an editorial, and we\u2019re talking about thousands of editorials,\u201d Mr. Marquardt said. \u201cHe could have gone to a major metropolitan paper, but he was very content being at a small newspaper.\u201d\nIn a December 2017 column, Mr. Fischman wrote that the newspaper editorial page \u201cmay be the best way to read a community\u2019s mind.\u201d\nMr. Fischman, though, was not only the voice of The Capital\u2019s editorial page but also a scrupulous copy editor with a habit of making his colleagues laugh by dropping dry one-liners in the newsroom, said Steve Gunn, the Capital Gazette newsroom\u2019s editor from 2013 to 2015. \u201cHe would say the funniest lines and not crack a smile,\u201d Mr. Gunn said in an interview.\nHe was also devoted to his job, working 12 hours a day or more and making himself known in the town as someone who had influence through his writing. \u201cThe important people in the community absolutely knew his name,\u201d Mr. Gunn said. \u201cThe power brokers knew to bend the ear of Gerald Fischman.\u201d\nRob Hiaasen was an editor and a features columnist, according to the newspaper\u2019s website. He was hired as the assistant editor of The Capital in 2010, according to the biography, and was previously a reporter for The Palm Beach Post and The Baltimore Sun.\n\u201cHe was dedicated to journalism,\u201d his brother, the writer Carl Hiaasen, said. \u201cHe spent his whole life as a journalist.\u201d\nAs a veteran of The Sun, Mr. Hiaasen arrived at The Capital \u201cwith the reputation of being a very gifted writer,\u201d Mr. Marquardt said. Mr. Hiaasen mentored a number of young reporters, working with them to improve their writing.\nHe \u201ctreated new reporters like his own children,\u201d said Elisha Sauers, a journalist at The Virginian-Pilot who reported for The Capital until 2016.\nMr. Hiaasen was also a creative journalist who was attached to finding the narrative arc of a story, Ms. Sauers said in an interview. Mr. Hiaasen would go on long walks to clear his mind and come back with small details he noticed that he would spin into columns, she said.\n\u201cHe was an observer of humanity,\u201d Ms. Sauers said. \u201cHe had this attitude of capturing these precious moments of life. And that really showed through his writing.\u201d\nMr. Marquardt noted that Mr. Hiaasen\u2019s \u201cgreat sense of humor\u201d also came through in his columns. Some of the most recent included: \u201cHow to find your spirit animal,\u201d \u201cHave you tried snow snorkeling?\u201d and a column about his mother, which Carl Hiaasen called \u201cprofoundly moving, but also funny and wise \u2014 which is what he was.\u201d\n\u201cHe was most passionate about doing hometown news at a time when good local journalism is struggling so much,\u201d Carl Hiaasen said. \u201cHe made a long commute from Baltimore everyday. He loved that paper; he loved the reporters.\u201d\nJohn McNamara held a wide range of jobs for the Capital Gazette newsroom over a career there that spanned more than 20 years.\nMr. McNamara, who has published two books on University of Maryland sports, was a longtime sports reporter and editor, according to his LinkedIn page and people who worked with him. More recently, Mr. McNamara covered news in Bowie, Md., a town west of Annapolis, on a daily basis, and was an editor of two of the Capital Gazette\u2019s local weekly newspapers.\nSheila Padgett, a resident of Bowie and friend to Mr. McNamara, said he single-handedly informed the city\u2019s residents about the community\u2019s news and politics.\n\u201cHe was the only game in town,\u201d Ms. Padgett said.\nSean Burns, 36, first met Mr. McNamara when he had been fresh out of college and was working in the newspaper\u2019s sports department.\n\u201cHe had that kind of old-school journalist mentality,\u201d Mr. Burns said of Mr. McNamara.\n\u201cSure, John could be rigid,\u201d Aaron Gray, 38, who had been the high school sports editor, added. \u201cBut you know, when it\u2019s 11:35 on a Friday night, he definitely got the job done. I\u2019d like to think he made the young writers around him better through his editing.\u201d\nDavid Elfin, a sports journalist who worked with Mr. McNamara on a book, said he made his presence felt outside the newsroom, too.\n\u201cHe would ask a quiet question more than being out front,\u201d Mr. Elfin said. \u201cBut believe me, all the coaches of the teams he covered knew John was there.\u201d\nG. Frederick Robinson, the mayor of Bowie, said he spoke with Mr. McNamara about twice a week.\n\u201cHe knew the right questions to ask,\u201d Mr. Robinson said.\nRebecca Smith was a recently hired sales assistant at the newspaper. She lived in Baltimore County with her fianc\u00e9, according to The Baltimore Sun.\nMs. Smith started her job at the Capital Gazette in November 2017, according to her Facebook page.\n\u201cShe was a very thoughtful person,\u201d Marty Padden, the paper\u2019s advertising director, told The Baltimore Sun. \u201cShe was kind and considerate, and willing to help when needed. She seemed to really enjoy to be working in the media business.\u201d\nMr. Padden added that Ms. Smith worked in health care before joining the newspaper and played field hockey while growing up in the Baltimore area.\n\u201cShe was a very kind person,\u201d he told The Sun. \u201cShe was very likable, and she had a good sense of humor.\u201d\nWendi Winters covered local news for The Capital and also wrote recurring columns like \u201cHome of the Week,\u201d according to the newspaper\u2019s website. She had previously worked in public relations in New York.\nMr. Marquardt said that editors at one point began looking for good writers who were willing to cover the sort of local stories some reporters scoffed at. Ms. Winters was first hired as a freelancer, and her byline became so prolific \u2014 and her writing so popular among readers \u2014 that her freelance fees soon exceeded what a salaried reporter was making, Mr. Marquardt said.\n\u201cMy accountant would come up and say, \u2018We can\u2019t do this,\u2019\u201d he said. So she was eventually hired.\n\u201cShe knew every human being in Anne Arundel County,\u201d Mr. Gunn said. \u201cIn the end, she was the heart of The Capital. Her community coverage was just remarkable, and it\u2019s what people talked about.\u201d\nMr. Gray, who also worked with Ms. Winters, said she tirelessly covered community events and \u201cdid such a great job at it.\u201d\n\u201cThe paper had such a strong vision about community news,\u201d he said, and Ms. Winters \u201cencompasses what that newspaper was about.\u201d", "date": "June 29, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/29/us/victims-capital-gazette-shooting.html", "tags": "victims shooting newsroom hiaasen gazette annapolis \u201d mcnamara capital editor ms. newspaper said"}
