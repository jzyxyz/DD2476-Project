{"title": "North Korea crisis in 300 words", "content": "As North Korea and the US continue their bilateral negotiations, here's an overview of a saga that has at times threatened nuclear war.\nThe Korean peninsula was divided after World War Two and the North developed an authoritarian government. \nIsolated globally, it saw nuclear weapons as its only deterrent against a world it believed was seeking to destroy it.\nProbably. North Korea has carried out six nuclear tests. \nIt claims, though this remains unverified, to have developed a nuclear bomb small enough to go on a long-range missile.\nIt also has a ballistic missile experts believe could reach the US.\nAfter months of escalating mutual threats, in January 2018 Mr Kim said he was \"open to dialogue\". \nMr Trump accepted, ignoring the pre-talk conditions of past presidents ie that North Korea denuclearise first. \nIn April 2018, the leaders of North and South Korea met. They agreed to find a way to end the Korean War and to \"denuclearise the peninsula\" - without agreeing what that meant. \nPyongyang ordered a halt to nuclear tests, freed US detainees and destroyed its nuclear research site.\nOn 12 June 2018, Mr Trump became the first sitting president to meet a North Korean leader.\nThe US and North Korea signed an agreement committing to the \"complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula\" but again didn't say what that meant. \nSince then, there has been little progress. The US wants North Korea to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons while Pyongyang wants a step-by-step approach to ease the crippling sanctions regime. \nIn early 2019, Mr Trump announced a second summit for late February with both sides expressing hope for progress.
