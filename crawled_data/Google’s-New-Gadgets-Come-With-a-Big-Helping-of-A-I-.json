{"title": "Google\u2019s New Gadgets Come With a Big Helping of A.I.", "content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Google\u2019s unveiling of new smartphones, smart speakers and other gadgets had all the makings of a typical technology product launch: a fawning crowd of superfans, skeptical journalists, slick product videos, not-so-subtle jabs at the competition, and overly romanticized descriptions of design choices, colors and materials.\nBut one nagging question lingered for Google, which makes nearly all of its money from selling online advertisements: Is it finally serious about making devices?\nOn Wednesday, Google did its best to demonstrate its commitment. It introduced two new Pixel smartphones, Google Home speakers both small and large, a laptop running the company\u2019s Chrome software, a new virtual reality headset and wireless headphones.\nBut Google\u2019s pitch for why its hardware is different had little to do with the hardware itself.\nUnlike the way an Apple event is conducted \u2014 usually chock-full of talk about chip speeds and screen resolutions \u2014 Google didn\u2019t spend much time on product specifications. Instead, its focus was on artificial intelligence. Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, spent the first 10 minutes explaining how artificial intelligence was helping Google Maps and its translations.\nMr. Pichai said that as an \u201cA.I. first\u201d company, this is a \u201cunique moment in time\u201d for Google to combine hardware, software and artificial intelligence. \u201cIt\u2019s radically rethinking how computing should work,\u201d he said.\nGoogle executives said it has been getting harder to find new hardware breakthroughs like bigger and better screens, but they believe significant improvements will come from artificial intelligence software that is developing at a faster clip than physical components.\nRick Osterloh, Google\u2019s senior vice president of hardware, compared the company\u2019s strategy for building devices to search and email. Google was not the first search engine and Gmail was hardly the first free web-based email provider \u2014 but both services reimagined what those products should do.\nLast year, the company started its \u201cMade By Google\u201d line of hardware products, headlined by the Pixel smartphone. The handset received positive reviews, but it did not threaten the premium smartphone dominance of Apple or Samsung.\nOn Wednesday, Google demonstrated how every hardware product had received an A.I. makeover. The Pixel smartphones come with an image-recognition app called Lens that can help users find information just by pointing a camera at a movie poster or an ad. The new \u201csmart speaker\u201d uses artificial intelligence to adjust its sound for the layout of a room. And new wireless headphones allow for instant translation of different languages.\nThe question of Google\u2019s commitment to hardware is a testament to the challenges of competing against devices made by Apple, Amazon and Samsung. Most other companies have found it hard to turn a profit in that product fight, and a flop can follow a company around for years \u2014 both in money and reputation lost.\nIt is also a recognition of Google\u2019s history of fits and starts with devices. The company once acquired Motorola, only to sell it a few years later to Lenovo. It bought Nest and Dropcam, but the introduction of new products from those home device companies seemed to stagnate after they joined Google, now operating under the parent company, Alphabet.\nWhether Google\u2019s device push sticks over the long haul remains to be seen, but its checkbook for hardware is still open.\nLast month, Google said it had agreed to acquire a team of 2,000 engineers from the Taiwanese manufacturer HTC for $1.1 billion. The hardware-focused personnel came from an HTC research and development division that was already working with Google to create the Pixel phones. Google said the acquisition will allow it to move faster in its efforts to develop new features for smartphones.\nThe deal is expected to close, pending regulatory approval, early next year.", "date": "Oct. 4, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/04/technology/google-pixel-hardware.html", "tags": "company intelligence \u201c helping come product gadgets a.i hardware artificial new \u2014 google big"}
