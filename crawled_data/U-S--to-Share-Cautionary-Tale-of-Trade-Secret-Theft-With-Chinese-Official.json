{"title": "U.S. to Share Cautionary Tale of Trade Secret Theft With Chinese Official", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 China\u2019s next leader, Xi Jinping, may never have heard of American Superconductor Corporation before he arrived here Monday, but by the end of his visit United States officials hope to make the small Massachusetts wind-energy company an object lesson in the impact of Chinese trade secret theft on American business.\nSenator John Kerry, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a Massachusetts Democrat, plans to raise personally with Mr. Xi the case of a company that saw 70 percent of its business evaporate last year after a Chinese partner enticed one of its employees to steal the crown jewel of its technology.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very clear and, in our judgment, egregious, palpable demonstration of the practice that we are deeply concerned about,\u201d Mr. Kerry said, \u201cbut it\u2019s not the only one. There are so many things: cyberattacks, access-to-market issues, espionage, theft. These are major points of discussion between us and China.\u201d\nBoth President Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. warned Mr. Xi on Tuesday that they had been hearing more and more from United States businesses about intellectual property and trade secret theft, but they did not specifically mention American Superconductor. However, background material on the company\u2019s experience was included in briefing papers distributed before the arrival in Washington of Mr. Xi\u2019s delegation, and a top administration official said the Chinese were aware of United States frustration over the case.\nWith anger toward Chinese trade and industrial practices emerging as a major theme for the 2012 campaign season, American Superconductor\u2019s story seems ripe for the moment.\nThe facts are difficult to dispute, given the volume of evidence. Last March, China\u2019s Sinovel, the world\u2019s second largest wind turbine manufacturer, abruptly refused shipments of American Superconductor\u2019s wind turbine electrical systems and control software. The blow was devastating; Sinovel provided more than 70 percent of the firm\u2019s revenues.\nThe value of undelivered components on existing contracts exceeded $700 million, Daniel Patrick McGahn, the company\u2019s president and chief executive, told investors. Its share price plunged by more than 80 percent in six months.\nLast summer, evidence emerged that Sinovel had promised $1.5 million to Dejan Karabasevic, a Serbian employee of American Superconductor in Austria.\nCompany officials say they found hundreds of e-mails and messages between senior Sinovel staff members and Mr. Karabasevic detailing the property to be stolen from the company, offering the money, and showing the actual transfer of the software. They even found signed contracts for the transaction.\nMr. Karabasevic was arrested, confessed to the crime, was convicted and is now serving time in an Austrian prison.\nAmerican Superconductor filed multiple lawsuits against Sinovel, seeking more than $1.2 billion in damages, cease and desist orders and copyright remedies.\nIn October, Sinovel countersued, saying it stopped accepting components because of quality problems and asking an arbitration commission to award it about $58 million for a breach of contract. The company is also demanding that American Superconductor pay its lawyers\u2019 fees, expenses and the cost of the arbitration.\nThis month, a court in Hainan, China, dismissed the smallest of the suits and said it should be heard by an arbitration commission in Beijing. The first arbitration hearing is scheduled for Feb. 24.\nCompany officials would not discuss their push for attention in Washington, but in a conference call with analysts in November, Mr. McGahn was open about his view of the case.\n\u201cWhile we acknowledge that this is a commercial matter, many have pointed to this case as an important litmus test for future energy cooperation between China and the West,\u201d he said, according to a transcript of the call.\nRobert D. Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation who has been leading a roundtable on such cases for the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, called the case particularly egregious. But, he added, \u201cThis is not a one-shot deal that affects one company in Massachusetts. It is unbelievably endemic.\u201d\nA lengthy paper by the foundation, due out in two weeks, will detail what Mr. Atkinson says has been the systematic pilfering of United States technology. \u201cThe Chinese have U.S. companies over a barrel because of the pressure for short-term earnings. They\u2019ve got renminbi dancing in their eyes,\u201d Mr. Atkinson said, referring to China\u2019s currency. \u201cBut nine years later the Chinese are eating your lunch.\u201d\nThe United States-China Business Council, which encourages economic cooperation, is more sanguine. Its survey of companies doing business in China found that only 18 percent said they had been asked to transfer technology as a condition for a business transaction. Three percent said they were able to scale back the request but did hand over some of their technology. About 2 percent said they met the request so they could stay in business in China.\nBut stories like American Superconductor\u2019s are rampant. Japanese and European companies like Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Siemens AG say they are competing against their once-junior Chinese partners and their own technology for the global high-speed rail business. Automobile writers have waxed indignantly about a new Chinese pickup truck that looks uncannily like the Ford F-150.\nSuch concerns are meshing with Mr. Obama\u2019s stern new push to make China play by the rules of international commerce. \u201cI will not stand by when our competitors don\u2019t play by the rules,\u201d the president said during his State of the Union address in January, announcing the creation of what he has called a Trade Enforcement Union \u201cthat will be charged with investigating unfair trade practices in countries like China.\u201d\nMr. Atkinson is not convinced that the administration will hold to that pledge. \u201cThey\u2019ve got to stop pretending that this engagement that they\u2019re in right now with China is yielding results,\u201d he said. \u201cFor every mole they whack, three more pop up. They need to vocally call out China on these egregious practices and say enough is enough.\u201d", "date": "FEB. 14, 2012FEB. 14, 2012FEB. 14, 2012", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/15/world/asia/chinese-official-to-hear-trade-theft-tale.html", "tags": "american tale company theft china business share u.s. secret \u201d official chinese trade cautionary superconductor"}
