{"title": "With 737 Max, Boeing Wants to Win Back Trust. Many Are Skeptical.", "content": "A charm offensive by Boeing to persuade airlines, crews and passengers to rally behind its 737 Max plane is already running into resistance.\nThe effort, which includes daily calls with carriers as well as meetings with pilots and flight attendants, is being hampered by a problem of the company\u2019s own making. After a bungled response to two deadly crashes involving the jet, Boeing is facing credibility problems.\nWhen Boeing dispatched one of its top lobbyists, John Moloney, to the headquarters of the influential union representing flight attendants a couple of weeks ago, he arrived determined to win their support. He met a skeptical audience.\n\u201cReading your body language, you look cynical,\u201d Mr. Moloney said, according to three people who were present and took notes during the discussion with the Association of Flight Attendants. \u201cIf this explanation doesn\u2019t address your concerns, I\u2019ll come back. I\u2019ll bring a pilot.\u201d\nSara Nelson, the head of the union, told Mr. Moloney that she was rooting for Boeing, but wasn\u2019t ready to tell flight attendants and travelers to fly on the Max.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, sitting here right now, that I can tell you there\u2019s complete confidence that everything\u2019s been fixed at Boeing,\u201d she told Mr. Moloney.\nThe meeting, punctuated by contentious moments between the two sides, underscores how difficult it will be for Boeing to restore credibility with airlines and passengers.\nIn recent weeks, the company\u2019s chief executive, Dennis A. Muilenburg, updated the heads of Southwest Airlines, American Airlines and United Airlines \u2014 the three carriers in the United States that fly the Max \u2014 on progress. On Tuesday, Boeing held a meeting in Amsterdam for European airlines to discuss new training for the Max, plans for a public affairs campaign and how to get idled planes ready to fly again. Similar meetings will happen in Shanghai, Singapore, Moscow, Dubai and Miami in the coming weeks.\nBoeing, a juggernaut with deep ties in Washington and one of the country\u2019s largest exporters, is on the defensive. The company is facing multiple federal investigations into design flaws that contributed to the accidents, along with a spate of lawsuits from the families of victims. Company executives and board members are deeply worried about the damage that has been done to Boeing\u2019s once-sterling reputation.\n\u201cCertainly there\u2019s concern,\u201d David Calhoun, the lead independent director of Boeing\u2019s board, said in an interview. \u201cThere is recognition on all of our parts that we\u2019re going to have to get out with restoring confidence in the Boeing brand broadly for years.\u201d\nBut there\u2019s a limit to how much Boeing can say. \u201cIt\u2019s an impossible situation because we\u2019re not allowed to comment on anything related to these accidents,\u201d Mr. Calhoun said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s only one thing to do, and that\u2019s to get a safe airplane back up in the sky,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t message my way into it. Boeing can\u2019t message its way into it.\u201d\n[Claims of shoddy production draw scrutiny to a second Boeing jet]\nBoeing has been working furiously to get the Max flying again since its grounding in March. The company is preparing to submit a software fix in the coming weeks for American regulators to approve.\nIt hosted hundreds of airline officials and pilots last month at the 737 Max factory in Renton, Wash. And it is in constant dialogue with regulators ahead of a meeting that the Federal Aviation Administration will host with global aviation authorities in Fort Worth on May 23.\n\u201cUltimately, the decision to return the Max to commercial service rests in the hands of global regulators,\u201d Gordon Johndroe, a Boeing spokesman, said in a statement.\nSimultaneously, Boeing is shaping a public relations strategy to reach passengers. Although the final media plan is still in the works, Boeing will not be relying solely on its executives to win back the public\u2019s trust \u2014 a recognition that its leadership has lost some good will.\nThe company and airlines agree that the chief executive, Mr. Muilenburg, as the face of a company under intense scrutiny, may not be the most effective messenger. Instead, the initial plan calls for pilots to play a major role in the campaign.\n\u201cWe think a key voice in all of this will be the pilots for our airlines, and their voice is very important,\u201d Mr. Muilenburg said on Boeing\u2019s earnings call last month. \u201cThat bond between the passenger and the pilot is one that\u2019s critical, and so we\u2019re working with our airline customers and those pilot voices to ensure that we can build on that going forward.\u201d\nBoeing has enlisted media agencies, including Edelman, to plan the strategy for reintroducing the Max, and is considering buying ads to promote the plane.\nAirline executives in the United States are eager for the Max to return to service and for Boeing to succeed. But many are privately frustrated with the company\u2019s handling of the crisis, according to three people briefed on the matter. They believe that Boeing has badly mismanaged the public response to the crashes and are irked that the public relations blitz will fall to their pilots.\nPilots, too, are reluctant to become brand ambassadors for Boeing, which barely interacted with them before the Lion Air crash in Indonesia last October, the first of the two deadly accidents.\n\u201cOur response is, yeah, that\u2019s cute, but we aren\u2019t going to hop into bed with you,\u201d said Mike Trevino, the spokesman for the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association. \u201cWe are still going to maintain an independent voice and call it as we see it.\u201d\nIn part, the reluctance stems from Boeing\u2019s mixed messaging. Despite having said, \u201cWe own it,\u201d Mr. Muilenburg has not acknowledged that anything was wrong with the design of the 737 Max, saying that the design process followed standard procedures.\n\u201cWe clearly have areas where we need to improve, including transparency,\u201d Mr. Johndroe, the Boeing spokesman, said in a statement.\nDuring the meeting last month, the flight attendants pushed Mr. Moloney to explain why the company didn\u2019t inform pilots about the software that contributed to both crashes. He acknowledged that Boeing should have told them, but kept reiterating that pilots were expected to be able to handle the conditions on both doomed flights.\nPassenger groups have demanded that Boeing take more responsibility for the Max debacle. \u201cIf they really wanted to fix the problem, you would think they would admit that it\u2019s their fault,\u201d said Paul Hudson, the president of Flyers Rights, a nonprofit group advocating for passengers. \u201cYou can\u2019t say, \u2018Oh, we own it, but we didn\u2019t do anything wrong and it\u2019s someone else\u2019s fault.\u2019\u201d\nPilots and airlines say Boeing has also struggled to communicate with them about how basic systems on the Max work. After the crash in Indonesia, pilots criticized Boeing for not informing them about the new software, which automatically pushes down the nose of the plane when the system deems it necessary. They have also been concerned by revelations that Boeing provided incomplete information about features in the cockpit.\nThis week, Boeing said it believed a key cockpit warning light was standard on all Max jets, but learned several months after beginning deliveries in 2017 that the light worked only if airlines had bought a separate feature, known as the angle of attack indicator. Southwest bought the plane without the indicator, on the assumption that the warning light was activated. It was only after the Lion Air accident that Boeing told regulators and some pilots that the light wasn\u2019t functional.\nBoeing told United something else entirely, creating even more confusion over Boeing\u2019s understanding, according to a person who took notes at the meeting. When United Airlines ordered 100 Max jets in 2017, Boeing told United that the alert and the angle of attack indicator came as a package deal. United declined the options at the time.\n\u201cEvery day it seems like a new set of questions pops up,\u201d said Dennis Tajer, a spokesman for the union representing American Airlines pilots. \u201cI\u2019m not here to be your arm candy. I\u2019m here to know about the airplane.\u201d\nToward the end of the meeting with the flight attendants, Mr. Moloney made a last-ditch effort to win them over.\n\u201cWe want you to be able to tell your members this plane is safe to fly,\u201d Mr. Moloney said, according to the three people in attendance. \u201cWhatever it takes.\u201d\nMs. Nelson, the union\u2019s leader, rattled off a list of things she needed from Boeing before agreeing. One was a letter from engineers working on the software update, saying they felt confident in the fix. Another was a full-throated apology from Boeing. Mr. Moloney promised to follow up.\n\u201cWe think that Boeing\u2019s credibility directly relates to the credibility of U.S. aviation,\u201d Ms. Nelson told him. \u201cIt\u2019s important to us that the credibility and the leadership of U.S. aviation is maintained around the world.\u201d", "date": "May 8, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/business/boeing-737-max.html", "tags": "company trust pilots mr. airlines moloney boeing win back wants \u201d skeptical many max"}
