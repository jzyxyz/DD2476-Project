{"title": "How What Happened Here In Charlottesville Was Inevitable", "content": "CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. \u2014 The ground underneath the statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee in Emancipation Park Saturday night was littered with evidence of President\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s cultivation of the far right: protest signs with messages like \u201cThe Jewish Media Is Going Down,\u201d \u201cThe Goyim Know\u201d and \u201cWe Support President Donald Trump.\u201d\nOnly several hours earlier here, white supremacist demonstrators and counter-protesters had engaged in\u00a0open combat for hours. The sounds of screams had mixed with the sounds of people coughing, their lungs full of mace. Tear gas canisters and rocks and full water bottles and bags of feces flew through the air. Blood stained the sidewalk.\nA few blocks away at the intersection of Fourth Street and Water Street Saturday night, police collected evidence from where a 20-year-old white supremacist named James Alex Fields Jr. had allegedly plowed his car into marching counter-protesters, sending bodies flying. A 32-year-old paralegal named Heather Heyer was killed and at least 19 others were injured. Police removed metal barricades from the street as a helicopter circled overhead. Nearby bars, usually bustling on a Saturday night, were shuttered and empty. On the sidewalk, a lone \u201cAlways Anti-Fascist\u201d poster \u2014 dropped or discarded during the day\u2019s chaos \u2014 stared up from the sidewalk.\nMeanwhile, at a friend\u2019s house in the area, 25-year-old Eli Mosley stepped away from a party he and his white supremacist buddies in the \u201calt-right\u201d group Identity Evropa were enjoying to talk to HuffPost over the phone. His voice was hoarse. He had spent the day screaming and chanting among thousands of like-minded people carrying Nazi and Confederate flags to protest the potential removal of the giant Lee statue in the park. The Anti-Defamation League said it was the largest gathering of white supremacists in more than a decade.\n\u201cOur people are feeling real good right now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe view this is as a civil rights movement at this point. We\u2019re advocating for white rights and white people, who will soon be a minority in this country. This day was a milestone pushing us into our next stage. We had a large turnout.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re coming back to Charlottesville,\u201d he added defiantly.\nThe clashes like the one in Charlottesville are largely a phenomenon of the Trump era. Over the past year, HuffPost has followed the white nationalists in their escalating war with their extremist opposite, from Berkeley to Portland to New Orleans to Gettysburg. In May, again in Charlottesville, white nationalists marched with torches and chanted Nazi slogans. Over the course of these battles, each side has grown angrier, and more heavily armed.\nEli Mosley is typical of the \u201calt-right\u201d movement \u2015 the latest incarnation of organized racism in America \u2015 which has grown exponentially larger since Donald Trump announced his run for the White House. He\u2019s young and media-savvy and knew how to bring thousands of white supremacists together for Saturday\u2019s \u201cUnite The Right\u201d rally. \u00a0\u00a0\nYears ago people like Mosley saw themselves as a fringe group in American politics. Now, under Trump, they feel like their views are gaining momentum, even becoming mainstream, they say.\nIn Trump\u2019s statement about Charlottesville Saturday, he refused to specifically condemn the white supremacists who besieged this picturesque college town. \u201cWe condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides \u2015 on many sides,\u201d he told reporters during a late-afternoon news conference in New Jersey.\u00a0\nWhite supremacists were more than pleased with his reaction. \u201cTrump\u2019s comments were good,\u201d read a post on the prominent white nationalist site Daily Stormer as they live-blogged yesterday\u2019s events.\u00a0\n\u201cHe refused to answer a question about White Nationalists supporting him,\u201d the post continued. \u201cNo condemnation at all. When asked to condemn, he just walked out of the room. Really, really good. God bless him.\u201d\nWith a president of the United States not condemning Nazism, and after over a year of signaling his support for white nationalism, experts are deeply concerned that we\u2019re in store for political violence even worse than the kind that visited Charlottesville.\nThat\u2019s because an emboldened fringe right, has in turn, emboldened the far left. Professor Brian Levin, head of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, said in an interview with HuffPost by phone that the fatality and injuries Saturday ensure that the \u201cmuch smaller and less coalesced far left,\u201d which includes anti-fascist or Antifa protesters, would go looking for \u201crevenge.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a reciprocal dance of extremism,\u201d Levin said.\nHeidi Beirich, head of the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s Intelligence Project, agreed. When anti-fascists show up to violently fight white supremacists, she said, it only gives \u201coxygen\u201d to the white supremacist cause.\n\u201cWe\u2019re concerned this is going to spill out of Charlottesville into many other places,\u201d she added.\nSomething that would go a long way in breaking this vicious cycle, they both agreed, is decisive action from the White House.\nIn a statement Sunday the Anti-Defamation League spelled out what that action could be. The group called on Trump to \u201cterminate all staff\u201d with any ties to white nationalists, likely referring to prominent White House advisers Steve Bannon, Steven Miller, and Sebastian Gorka, all of whom are linked to racist, fringe figures and groups.\n\u201cThis is a moment that demands moral leadership,\u201d ADL President Jonathan Greenblatt said in a statement. \u201cPresident Trump should acknowledge that this is not a matter of equivalence between two sides with similar gripes. There is no rationalizing white supremacy and no room for this vile bigotry. It is un-American and it needs to be condemned without hesitation.\u201d\nOn Sunday morning, Eli Mosley said he was preparing to leave the house where he had partied and slept the night before with his fellow white nationalists. He said he thought Trump\u2019s comments were \u201cneutral in a way\u201d that he liked.\nHe claimed to have lost his job three months ago after being exposed as a white nationalist online. He said he\u2019s working full-time now as an alt-right organizer. For this new life, he said he was preparing to drive home to Pennsylvania Sunday so he could pack his things for a move to Virginia.\nIn Virginia, he said, he could more easily organize the next big alt-right rallies in the state capital, Richmond, and of course, in Charlottesville.\nAmerica does not do a good job of tracking incidents of hate and bias. We need your help to create a database of such incidents across the country, so we all know what\u2019s going on.
