He added that \u201cto some extent,\u201d American businesses and consumers would end up paying.\n\u201cAgain, both sides will suffer on this.\u201d\nKudlow\u2019s remarks essentially threw cold water on Trump\u2019s Twitter message last week in which he contended that \u201cTariffs are NOW being paid to the United States by China of 25% on 250 Billion Dollars worth of goods & products.\u201d\nThough journalists have repeatedly corrected the president\u2019s erroneous claims, explaining that tariffs don\u2019t work that way, he has continued to perpetuate the myth in statement after statement.\nIn reality, as Wallace noted, importers bear the brunt of tariffs, meaning American businesses relying on Chinese products will end up paying for fees the Trump administration imposes on those items. The added expenses typically hit everyday consumers.\nIn March, a study compiled by economists from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Columbia University and Princeton University illustrated that point, finding that losses are \u201cbeing born (sic) by the consumers of imports.\u201d\nThe Trump administration raised duties on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports from 10% to 25% last week as part of its escalating trade war with the manufacturing powerhouse.", "date": "\n05/12/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/larry-kudlow-trump-china-tariffs_n_5cd84758e4b0796a95dd9ee9", "tags": "american goods contradicting china u-s- kudlow \u201d larry trump tariffs chinese pay admits wallace"}
