{"title": "Killings in Gaza, New Embassy in Jerusalem, and Peace as Distant as Ever", "content": "JERUSALEM \u2014 Across the Gaza Strip on Monday morning, loudspeakers on minarets urged Palestinians to rush the fence bordering Israel, where they were met by army snipers. At least 60 were killed and thousands injured, local officials said \u2014 the worst day of carnage there since Israel invaded Gaza in 2014.\nHours later, a beaming Ivanka Trump helped unveil a stone marker etched with her father\u2019s name on the new American Embassy in Jerusalem, keeping his campaign promise to officially acknowledge Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital. An audience of 800 religious conservatives and right-wing politicians from both countries sang \u201cHallelujah.\u201d\n\u201cWhat a glorious day,\u201d exulted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\nThe two scenes, only an hour\u2019s drive apart, illustrated the chasm dividing Israelis and Palestinians more than at any moment in recent history.\n[Read the latest updates on the protests in Gaza.]\nFor generations, both sides of the conflict have been locked in competing, mutually negating narratives, with only sporadic flickers of hope for peace despite the efforts of a long list of presidents and secretaries of state.\nNow, with the militant Hamas movement hanging on to control of Gaza, and Mr. Netanyahu backed by President Trump, neither side is even listening to the other, and the Palestinians have lumped the United States together with Israel as an overt adversary.\nResponsibility for the violence on Monday rested \u201csquarely with Hamas,\u201d said Raj Shah, a White House spokesman, for \u201cintentionally and cynically provoking\u201d Israel by urging Palestinians to storm the border fence. \u201cIsrael has the right to defend itself,\u201d he said.\nIn Gaza, Khalil al-Hayya, deputy chief of Hamas, blamed the United States for inciting the violence by moving the embassy to Jerusalem, reversing decades of American policy and defying international consensus. \u201cThe American administration bears responsibility for all consequences following the implementation of this unjust decision,\u201d he said.\nThe two sides were in equally different worlds when speaking of how the embassy opening would affect the moribund peace process.\nPalestinians, who hope to see the eastern part of Jerusalem as the capital of a Palestinian state, see the embassy move as an abdication of any vestige of American impartiality in determining the region\u2019s future. Since Mr. Trump announced the move in December, Palestinian leaders have flatly rejected the idea of peace talks under American auspices.\nBut at the embassy dedication, Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and adviser, predicted that \u201cwhen there is peace in this region, we will look back upon this day and will remember that the journey to peace started with a strong America recognizing the truth.\u201d\nMr. Netanyahu spoke of peace with \u201call our neighbors,\u201d praising Mr. Trump and his team as truth-tellers for acknowledging what he called the fact that Israel\u2019s capital was an \u201ceternal, undivided\u201d Jerusalem.\n\u201cA peace that is built on lies will crash on the rocks of Middle Eastern reality,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said.\nWith evangelical pastors preaching and Sheldon G. Adelson, the influential Jewish Republican donor who had pressed Mr. Trump to move the embassy, in the front row, the only reference to the Gaza violence came when Mr. Kushner said that \u201cthose provoking violence are part of the problem and not part of the solution.\u201d\nFor Israelis, the day was one many had dreamed of for generations. Regardless of their politics, it seemed unjust that the international community refused to see Jerusalem as their capital \u2014 a position they saw as a denial of the city\u2019s Jewish history.\nFor Palestinians, the embassy move\u2019s timing on the 70th anniversary of Israel\u2019s independence \u2014 the eve of the day they commemorate the expulsion or flight of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from their homes in what became Israel \u2014 became the focal point of demonstrations along the Gaza fence for two months leading up to it.\nBy midafternoon Monday east of Gaza City, the scene at the fence resembled a pitched battle \u2014 a chaotic panorama of black smoke, wailing sirens, streams of tear gas and recurring gunfire. Emergency workers with stretchers carried off a stream of injured people, many with leg wounds, some having been shot in the abdomen. A number were teenagers.\nA voice on a loudspeaker urged the crowd forward: \u201cGet closer! Get closer!\u201d\nThe charge was often led by women dressed in black, waving Palestinian flags and urging others to follow. \u201cWe don\u2019t want just one or two people to get closer,\u201d said an elderly woman clutching a shoulder bag and a flag. \u201cWe want a big group.\u201d\nSome in the crowds were planting or hurling explosives, Israel said, and many were flying flaming kites into Israel: At least one kite outside the Nahal Oz kibbutz, across the fence from Gaza City, ignited a wildfire.\nAfter midday prayers, the atmosphere grew even more charged when officials from Hamas and other militant factions addressed the worshipers, urging them into the fray and claiming \u2014 falsely, to all appearances \u2014 that the fence had been breached and that Palestinians were flooding into Israel.\nHamas officials vowed that the protests would continue, but also hinted at the possibility of a military strike at Israel by the group\u2019s military wing, the Qassam brigades, a response that could bring about another Gaza war.\nIsrael said no Palestinians had crossed the fence, but said it had repulsed several unsuccessful attempts by Hamas to have armed fighters slip across into Israel and wreak havoc \u2014 which Israel has maintained all along has been the true military objective of Hamas.\nAt least three separate squads of armed fighters \u201ctried to use the commotion and smoke and dynamics of the riots as concealment, and then launched an attack on the fence,\u201d said Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces.\nOne Israeli soldier was wounded by shrapnel from what was believed to be an explosive device, he said, and a variety of explosives were hurled at the Israelis by Palestinians. There had been \u201cnumerous shots\u201d fired at Israeli soldiers, the army said.\nThe attempts to breach the fence expanded from five locations in previous protests to 13, Colonel Conricus said, calling Monday\u2019s action an \u201cunprecedented level of violence.\u201d\nIsrael responded with gunfire and tear gas, and Israeli jets struck five targets in a Hamas military training facility in the northern Gaza Strip, and two other Hamas military positions in the area were hit by an aircraft and a tank.\nIsrael has made clear throughout the protests that it holds Hamas responsible for any violence emanating from Gaza, and Colonel Conricus made no apologies for the body count. \u201cHamas is killing Gaza,\u201d he said. \u201cWe, on the other hand, are defending our homes.\u201d\nIsrael\u2019s military response restored international attention to the Palestinian cause with each one-sided casualty report, and revived Hamas\u2019s flagging political fortunes.\nThe rival Palestinian Authority was left to look reactive and meek by comparison. Indeed, protests on the West Bank on Monday were fairly uneventful, and the authority\u2019s president, Mahmoud Abbas, gave an unusually short speech addressing the Gaza death toll, calling for three days of mourning, a one-day strike, and terming the new embassy \u201can American settlement outpost in East Jerusalem.\u201d\nOne clear loser, veterans of Israeli-Palestinian talks said, was peace in the region, which seemed ever more distant.\n\u201cIsrael claims all of Jerusalem, and is doing their best to ensure it remains that way,\u201d said Aaron David Miller, a former Middle East negotiator in Republican and Democratic administrations. \u201cAnd the Trump administration is validating that in a way no other administration has.\u201d\nThe American Embassy, he said, is the new symbol of that partnership.\nHamas and other jihadist groups have \u201ca national and religious issue around which to rally: defense of Jerusalem,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cThe embassy is now the physical manifestation of that campaign.\u201d", "date": "May 14, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/14/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-jerusalem-embassy.html", "tags": "ever hamas palestinians peace killings embassy distant \u201d israel gaza jerusalem new \u2014"}
