{"title": "A \u2018Particularly Bright\u2019 Moment Brings Another Fed Rate Increase", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve\u2019s chairman, Jerome H. Powell, said on Wednesday that the American economy was experiencing \u201ca particularly bright moment\u201d as the Fed announced a widely expected increase in its benchmark interest rate and signaled that it planned to continue raising rates.\nMr. Powell emphasized that the decision to raise rates to a range between 2 and 2.25 percent was not intended to get in the way of continued growth. \u201cMy colleagues and I are doing all we can to keep the economy strong, healthy and moving forward,\u201d he said.\nBut the Fed\u2019s decision was criticized almost immediately by President Trump, who opened a Wednesday afternoon news conference by declaring himself \u201cnot happy\u201d with higher rates.\nMr. Trump once again broke with the practice of his recent predecessors, who avoided public comment about monetary policy. Higher interest rates increase the cost of federal borrowing and Mr. Trump, whose fiscal policies have sharply increased the scale of federal borrowing, suggested he would prefer lower borrowing costs. \u201cWe could do other things with the money,\u201d he said.\nHe added, however, that the Fed was raising rates \u201cbecause we\u2019re doing so well.\u201d\nThe Fed\u2019s decision, announced after a two-day meeting of its Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy, represents the eighth time that the Fed has raised interest rates since the 2008 financial crisis, and the third time this year. Another increase is expected in December.\nThe Fed described economic conditions as \u201cstrong.\u201d It predicted that growth this year could top 3 percent, before slowing in coming years. Unemployment remains low, inflation remains around the 2 percent pace the Fed regards as optimal, and the pace of investment has increased, it said.\nFor the first time in recent years, the Fed did not describe monetary policy as \u201caccommodative,\u201d indicating that its benchmark interest rate is rising back toward a level the Fed regards as neutral, meaning that monetary policy is neither stimulating nor restraining economic growth.\nMr. Powell emphasized, however, that the change in wording was not intended to signal any change in policy. He said monetary policy remained accommodative at the moment.\nA number of Mr. Powell\u2019s colleagues have argued publicly that the Fed most likely needs to raise rates to a level that begins to restrict economic activity. The Fed warned last year that there was no need for a tax cut in the midst of a steady economic expansion. Mr. Trump and Congress ignored that advice, cutting taxes and increasing spending. The result has been a short-term increase in economic growth, which some Fed officials fear could lead to higher inflation.\nMr. Powell said that gradual rate increases remained the best way for the Fed to navigate between the danger the economy will overheat and cause inflation, and the danger the economy will falter.\n\u201cWe think that gradually raising interest rates is the way that we take both of those risks seriously,\u201d he said.\nMr. Powell also said that the Fed sees little sign of inflationary pressure.\nIn a new round of forecasts the Fed published Wednesday, members of the policymaking committee predicted the central bank would raise rates five more times by the end of 2020.\nAsked if he agreed, Mr. Powell emphasized his uncertainty about both the medium-term economic outlook and the path of Fed policy. He described the prospect of restrictive monetary policy as \u201cvery possible\u201d but added that \u201cit depends\u201d on the evolution of economic conditions.\nSpeaking before Mr. Trump issued his latest criticisms of Fed policy, Mr. Powell said that the Fed was carrying out its mission and that \u201cwe don\u2019t consider political factors.\u201d\nBut Mr. Trump\u2019s policies, if not his politics, could surely influence the Fed\u2019s trajectory given uncertainty about the trade war the president has started with China, the European Union, Canada and Mexico.\nMr. Powell said that the Fed was hearing \u201ca rising chorus of concerns from businesses all over the country\u201d about the economic impact of those tariffs. But Mr. Powell added that the Fed has yet to see a negative effect in the economic data.\nThe Fed chairman outlined some areas in which the president\u2019s policies might bring surprises on the upside.\nRepublicans argued that tax cuts would increase economic growth by creating \u201csupply side\u201d incentives for increased investment in the economy. Mr. Powell said it was too early to judge the effects, but \u201cwe hope they\u2019re huge.\u201d\nHe also expressed hope that the Fed would continue to be surprised by the number of Americans who are returning to the labor force as the economy strengthens.\nA few Fed officials, and a larger group of outside economists, argue the Fed is moving too quickly to raise rates. They point to the slow pace of wage growth as evidence there is still considerable slack in the labor market. Mr. Powell acknowledged Wednesday that the gains from economic growth have not been distributed evenly.\n\u201cThe benefits of this strong economy have not reached all Americans,\u201d he said.\nIn the Fed\u2019s latest batch of economic projections, 12 of the 16 officials who submitted forecasts said they expected to raise rates in December.\nFed officials predicted three rate increases in 2019 and one in 2020. The new forecasts, which included 2021 for the first time, showed that Fed officials expect to end the current rate increase cycle in 2020. None are planned in 2021. That means the march toward higher rates is well past the halfway point: Eight increases in hand, five more planned.\nMarkets continue to anticipate fewer rate increases in coming years, in part because of doubts that the economy will continue to grow.\n\u201cOur view is that the Fed will press ahead with gradual rate hikes for now, but that officials are still underestimating just how quickly the economy is likely to lose momentum next year, as the fiscal boost fades and monetary tightening bites,\u201d said Michael Pearce, senior United States economist at Capital Economics. \u201cWe expect the Fed to call time on rate hikes and ultimately begin cutting rates by early 2020.\u201d\nSo far, there is little sign the Fed is crimping economic growth. Consumer borrowing costs are rising, but rates remain quite low by historical standards. The average rate on a 30-year mortgage loan reached 4.55 percent in August, up from 3.96 percent in December 2015, according to Freddie Mac.\nAs rates climb, the economic effects are likely to increase. Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive, said the Fed\u2019s rate increases have raised the cost of the average payment on a five-year car loan by about 2 percent.\n\u201cIt will not get better for consumers or the industry from here,\u201d Mr. Smoke said.", "date": "Sept. 26, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/26/us/politics/federal-reserve-raises-interest-rates.html", "tags": "brings increase \u2018 fed moment rates \u201d economy economic another rate said powell bright particularly"}
