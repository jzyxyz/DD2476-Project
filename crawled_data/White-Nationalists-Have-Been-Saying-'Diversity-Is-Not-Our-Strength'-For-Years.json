{"title": "White Nationalists Have Been Saying 'Diversity Is Not Our Strength' For Years", "content": "Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) has again flirted with being an open white nationalist. In a tweet Friday, the congressman lashed out at multiculturalism.\n\u201cDiversity is not our strength,\u201d the congressman wrote, linking to an article on a deeply dubious\u00a0anti-immigration website called Voice of Europe, which quotes Hungary\u2019s far-right prime minister, Viktor Orban, as saying that \u201cmixing cultures will not lead to a higher quality of life but a lower one.\u201d\u00a0\nBut where have we heard this phrase before?\u00a0\nWell, David Duke, the former KKK grand wizard and prominent American white supremacist, has used it when exploiting tragedies or acts of violence:\u00a0\nThomas Robb, current national director of the KKK,\u00a0told Slate earlier this year that \u201cdiversity is not our strength. Diversity will kill us.\u201d\u00a0Here\u2019s Robb at a cross-burning rally in Texas:\nBilly Roper, a prominent American neo-Nazi, wrote in his book\u00a0\u201cThe Big Picture\u201d that \u201cDiversity is not our strength. Neither is being outnumbered and outgunned.\u201d Here\u2019s Roper at an Aryan Nations-sponsored White Heritage Days Festival in Alabama:\u00a0\nBrad Griffin, also known as Hunter Wallace, a leader of a white nationalist group based in Alabama, tweeted \u201cdiversity ISN\u2019T our strength\u201d last month.\u00a0Griffin organized a \u201cWhite Lives Matter\u201d rally in Tennessee recently, which featured neo-Confederate, southern secessionist, and neo-Nazi participants.\nIn 2011, writer Peter Brimelow,\u00a0the white nationalist behind the racist site VDARE, told CNN that \u201cDiversity is not strength.\u201d He uttered the phrase previously in 2004, while praising a book by conservative blogger Michelle Malkin that defended the mass incarceration of Japanese-Americans in concentration camps during World War II. The rationale for imprisoning thousands of people in the camps, he told The Denver Post, was \u201cvery straightforward. Racial profiling always makes sense. It\u2019s just that, you know, diversity is not strength,\u00a0it\u2019s weakness. It\u2019s impossible to discuss it honestly, though.\u201d\nHere\u2019s Brimelow at a recent conference of the National Policy Institute, the \u201cthink tank\u201d of the so-called \u201calt-right,\u201d a loose association of fascists and white supremacists. That\u2019s him second from the left, in between his white nationalist pals Richard Spencer and Jared Taylor:\u00a0\nAnd in 2007,\u00a0Gordon Baum,\u00a0co-founder and then-CEO of the racist group Council of Conservative Citizens (CCC) \u2014 whose website has referred to blacks as \u201ca retrograde species of humanity\u201d \u2014 told the Birmingham News that \u201cdiversity is not our strength,\u00a0it is our calamity, our downfall.\u201d\n\u201cDiversity is not our strength\u201d has been seen on white nationalist fliers in Pennsylvania. There\u2019s also a whole thread called \u201cDiversity is not our strength\u201d on the popular white supremacist hate site Stormfront.\u00a0\nAnd variations of the phrase appear most commonly today on alt-right Twitter accounts, often paired with cherry-picked news stories of non-white people committing crimes.\u00a0\nMark Pitcavage, senior research fellow at the Anti-Defamation League\u2019s Center on Extremism, told HuffPost that the phrase isn\u2019t a white supremacist slogan, \u201cas much as it is an obvious thing for them to say.\u201d\u00a0\nIt\u2019s a response to hearing liberal politicians and academics praise diversity, he said. And the phrase isn\u2019t the sole provenance of self-proclaimed white supremacists. There are hard-right figures and anti-immigration groups,\u00a0some of them bordering on extremist, who have used the phrase.\u00a0\nCo-founder of Vice Media, Gavin McInnes, the \u201cAlt-Lite\u201d figure and self-proclaimed \u201cwestern chauvinist\u201d founder of the Proud Boys has also used it.\u00a0In a video posted earlier this year, he talks about how he thinks other countries\u2019 food is yucky, and he really doesn\u2019t like it! The video was titled \u201cDiversity is NOT our strength (and shut up about restaurants).\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd Michael Anton, the controversial White House aide selected by President Donald Trump to serve on the National Security Council, used the phrase last year in an essay in which he defended the America First Committee, a World War II-era isolationist group known for its anti-Semitism.\n\u201c\u2018Diversity\u2019 is not \u2018our strength;\u2019 it\u2019s a source of weakness, tension and disunion,\u201d Anton wrote. \u201cAmerica is not a \u2018nation of immigrants\u2019; we are originally a nation of settlers, who later chose to admit immigrants, and later still not to, and who may justly open or close our doors solely at our own discretion, without deference to forced pieties.\u201d\nPitcavage said it\u2019s alarming to see an elected official like Rep. King make the statement.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s problematic, first of all because it suggests that diversity is a bad thing, which suggests that people should work to remove diversity,\u201d Pitcavage said. \u201cNot only does that speak against the whole American experiment, it sends a clear message to anybody who is not white or is in some way a minority or is not part of whatever selected pool Mr. King approves of.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHow are his constituents supposed to feel?\u201d he continued. \u201cHe\u2019s from Iowa. Iowa is not the most diverse state in the country, but there are people of different faiths and ethnicities and he\u2019s supposed to represent them.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nHeidi Beirich, director of the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s Intelligence Project, which monitors hate groups, says she\u2019s heard white supremacists say the \u201cdiversity is not our strength\u201d\u00a0expression since at least 1999, when she joined the SPLC.\u00a0\nKing, she said, \u201cclearly is a racist who shares some views with white nationalists on things like immigrants for example.\u201d\u00a0\nKing has a long history of signaling support of white nationalism. He keeps a Confederate flag on his desk, even though he is from Iowa, which was not part of the Confederacy. He has said America shouldn\u2019t apologize for slavery. He\u00a0 has called putting emancipator Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill \u201cracist\u201d and \u201csexist.\u201d He, of course, has indulged in birther beliefs, once suggesting President Barack Obama was born in Kenya.\u00a0\nRacial profiling in Ferguson, Missouri, during protests over the police shooting of Michael Brown, King once said, was not an issue because all the protesters were of the same \u201ccontinental origin.\u201d He has argued that most undocumented immigrants are \u201cdrug mules.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cFor every [undocumented immigrant] who\u2019s a valedictorian, there\u2019s another 100 out there who weigh 130 pounds\u2014and they\u2019ve got calves the size of cantaloupes because they\u2019re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert,\u201d he said.\u00a0\nHe once tweeted a photo of himself standing with Geert Wilders, the rabidly Islamophobic far-right Dutch politician, with the caption: \u201cCultural suicide by demographic transformation must end.\u201d\u00a0\nAnd in March of this year, King tweeted \u201cWilders understands that culture and demographics are our destiny. We can\u2019t restore our civilization with somebody else\u2019s babies.\u201d\u00a0\nThis prompted gushing praise from white nationalists.\u00a0\u201cSteve King is basically an open white nationalist at this point,\u201d Andrew Anglin wrote on his popular white supremacist site,\u00a0The Daily Stormer.\u00a0\n\u201cOUR civilization and SOMEBODY ELSE\u2019S babies. Not really any nuance there,\u201d Anglin wrote. \u201cSteve King should be Speaker of the House. Period. There [sic] is as plain as the nose on your face. He is /ourguy/.\u201d\nRichard Spencer, the alt-right figurehead, wrote that\u00a0\u201cKing is more /ourguy/ than Trump has ever been, but would he be saying these kinds of things without Trump? We can only hope these kinds of statements serve to embolden more of our people, as they see that people like themselves are in positions of power.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nAnd David Duke, the former KKK leader, called for King to succeed Trump as president in 2024 to \u201cfinish the job.\u201d\u00a0\nKing\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a HuffPost inquiry Saturday as to whether he considers himself a white nationalist.\u00a0\nAmerica does not do a good job of tracking incidents of hate and bias. We need your help to create a database of such incidents across the country, so we all know what\u2019s going on.\u00a0Tell us your story.\u00a0", "date": "\n12/09/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/steve-king-diversity-strength-white-supremacy_n_5a2afd21e4b073789f69bfbf", "tags": "saying strength nationalists diversity wrote king white \u201d phrase years nationalist"}
