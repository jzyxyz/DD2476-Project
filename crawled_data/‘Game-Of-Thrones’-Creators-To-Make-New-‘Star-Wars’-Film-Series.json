Weiss, the creators of \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d are going to write and produce a \u201cStar Wars\u201d film series, StarWars.com announced Tuesday.\nThe series will take place in a galaxy far, far away, but will not be tied to the trilogy being developed by \u201cThe Last Jedi\u201d filmmaker Rian Johnson or the episodic Skywalker saga.\n\u201cDavid and Dan are some of the best storytellers working today,\u201d Kathleen Kennedy, president of Lucasfilm, said in the announcement. \u201cTheir command of complex characters, depth of story and richness of mythology will break new ground and boldly push Star Wars in ways I find incredibly exciting.\u201d\n\u201cIn the summer of 1977 we traveled to a galaxy far, far away, and we\u2019ve been dreaming of it ever since,\u201d Benioff and Weiss said in a joint statement. \u201cWe are honored by the opportunity, a little terrified by the responsibility, and so excited to get started as soon as the final season of Game of Thrones is complete.\u201d\nThough some may be excited about the news, people on Twitter were a bit skeptical.\nMany fans were concerned that tropes from the popular HBO show, such as incest and rape, would seep into the \u201cStar Wars\u201d universe.\nIn July, HBO also announced that Benioff and Weiss were going to work on its upcoming Civil War drama\u00a0\u201cConfederate,\u201d a show whose premise\u00a0immediately sparked criticism. This prompted others on Twitter to question the decision to have them write and produce the new\u00a0\u201cStar Wars\u201d series.\nSome Twitter users were disappointed that a woman or a person of color wasn\u2019t chosen for the role, especially since Kennedy has mentioned in the past that she would like to see a woman direct a \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie (though the announcement did not say whether Benioff and Weiss would direct the series they will create).\nThere is no release date as of yet, which we\u2019re sure is making both Jon Snow and Kylo Ren incredibly sad.", "date": "\n02/06/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/game-of-thrones-star-wars_n_5a7a040ce4b0d0ef3c0a1b38", "tags": "film \u2018 game make benioff twitter weiss new wars series \u201d creators thrones star far"}
