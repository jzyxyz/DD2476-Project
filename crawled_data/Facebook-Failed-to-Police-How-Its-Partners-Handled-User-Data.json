{"title": "Facebook Failed to Police How Its Partners Handled User Data", "content": "Facebook failed to closely monitor device makers after granting them access to the personal data of hundreds of millions of people, according to a previously unreported disclosure to Congress last month.\nFacebook\u2019s loose oversight of the partnerships was detected by the company\u2019s government-approved privacy monitor in 2013. But it was never revealed to Facebook users, most of whom had not explicitly given the company permission to share their information. Details of those oversight practices were revealed in a letter Facebook sent last month to Senator Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat, a privacy advocate and frequent critic of the social media giant.\nIn the letter, a copy of which Mr. Wyden provided to The New York Times, Facebook wrote that by early 2013 it had entered into data-sharing agreements with seven device makers to provide what it called the \u201cFacebook experience\u201d \u2014 custom-built software, typically, that gave those manufacturers\u2019 customers access to Facebook on their phones. Those partnerships, some of which date to at least 2010, fall under a consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission drafted in 2011 and intended to oversee the company\u2019s privacy practices.\n[Read more about Facebook\u2019s data-sharing partnerships with device makers.]\nFacebook ultimately entered into dozens of similar data-sharing partnerships, most of which the company began winding down this spring after revelations that it had allowed Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm, to acquire the personal information of tens of millions of people. The firm used some of that information in efforts to aid President Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign.\nWhen a team from PricewaterhouseCoopers conducted the initial F.T.C.-mandated assessment in 2013, it tested Facebook\u2019s partnerships with Microsoft and Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry handset. In both cases, PricewaterhouseCoopers found only \u201climited evidence\u201d that Facebook had monitored or checked its partners\u2019 compliance with its data use policies. That finding was redacted from a public version of PricewaterhouseCoopers\u2019s report released by the F.T.C. in June.\n\u201cFacebook claimed that its data-sharing partnerships with smartphone manufacturers were on the up and up,\u201d Mr. Wyden said. \u201cBut Facebook\u2019s own, handpicked auditors said the company wasn\u2019t monitoring what smartphone manufacturers did with Americans\u2019 personal information, or making sure these manufacturers were following Facebook\u2019s own policies.\u201d He added, \u201cIt\u2019s not good enough to just take the word of Facebook \u2014 or any major corporation \u2014 that they\u2019re safeguarding our personal information.\u201d\nIn a statement, a Facebook spokeswoman said, \u201cWe take the F.T.C. consent order incredibly seriously and have for years submitted to extensive assessments of our systems.\u201d She added, \u201cWe remain strongly committed to the consent order and to protecting people\u2019s information.\u201d\nFacebook, like other companies under F.T.C. consent decree, largely dictates the scope of each assessment. In two subsequent assessments, Facebook\u2019s October letter suggests, the company was graded on a seemingly less stringent policy with data partners. On those two, Facebook had to show that its partners had agreed to its data use policies.\nA Wyden aide who reviewed the unredacted assessments said they contained no evidence that Facebook had ever addressed the original problem. The Facebook spokeswoman did not directly address the 2013 test failure, or the company\u2019s apparent decision to change the test in question.\nBecause the United States has no general consumer privacy law, F.T.C. consent decrees have emerged as the federal government\u2019s chief means of regulating privacy practices at Facebook, Google and other companies that amass huge amounts of personal data about people who use their products. In letters and congressional testimony, F.T.C. officials have pointed to the decrees as evidence of robust consumer privacy protection in the United States.\nA spokesman for PricewaterhouseCoopers acknowledged in a statement that Facebook defines the privacy procedures, known as \u201ccontrols,\u201d that are tested during the assessments.\n\u201cChanges to controls may occur as platforms evolve, such that a control tested in one period may not be identical in a subsequent period,\u201d the spokesman said.\nFacebook\u2019s letter disclosing the assessors\u2019 findings came in response to questions Mr. Wyden raised during an intelligence hearing in September. The hearing was held just weeks after The Times reported that Facebook had struck data-sharing deals with dozens of phone and tablet manufacturers, including Microsoft, BlackBerry and Amazon.\nWhile the assessment reports were publicly released by the F.T.C. in June, they included significant redactions, which Facebook and PricewaterhouseCoopers said were necessary to protect trade secrets.\nMr. Wyden, whose staff had viewed the full assessments, said at the hearing that he found parts of the unredacted reports \u201cvery troubling\u201d and pressed Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, to release them in their entirety.\nThe Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington-based consumer rights group that helped obtain the 2011 consent decree, is currently suing the agency for release of the full assessments, arguing that the public cannot otherwise judge how effectively the F.T.C. is policing privacy violations.\n\u201cWhat is clear is that the F.T.C. has failed to enforce the consent order,\u201d said Marc Rotenberg, the president of the privacy rights group. \u201cAnd this has come at enormous cost to American consumers.\u201d\nThe F.T.C. declined to comment.\nFacebook\u2019s compliance with the consent decree is the subject of a new F.T.C. investigation opened in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal.\nIn the letter last month, Facebook\u2019s vice president for United States public policy, Kevin Martin, noted that the assessors\u2019 findings had not caused Facebook to fail PricewaterhouseCoopers\u2019s overall evaluation: The assessors concluded that Facebook was operating \u201cwith sufficient effectiveness to provide reasonable assurance\u201d that it was protecting its users\u2019 privacy.\nIt remains unclear whether Facebook has ever scrutinized how its partner companies handled personal data. A spokeswoman declined to provide any examples of the company\u2019s doing so.\nA BlackBerry official, who declined to discuss details of the companies\u2019 data-sharing agreement, said BlackBerry did not think that Facebook had ever audited its data use, but noted that BlackBerry\u2019s business model relies on protecting users\u2019 personal information.", "date": "Nov. 12, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/12/technology/facebook-data-privacy-users.html", "tags": "handled company personal consent user failed \u201d facebook f.t.c data police partners privacy"}
