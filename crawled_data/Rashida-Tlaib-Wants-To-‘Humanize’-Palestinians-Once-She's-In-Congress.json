{"title": "Rashida Tlaib Wants To \u2018Humanize\u2019 Palestinians Once She's In Congress", "content": "Former Michigan state legislator Rashida Tlaib is set to make history on several fronts after her primary win on Tuesday for a U.S. House seat in Michigan\u2019s 13th Congressional District. \nWith no Republican challenger in November, Tlaib is set to become the first Palestinian-American woman and first Muslim woman in Congress. (Other candidates, including Minnesota state Rep. Ilhan Omar, are hoping to join her in the latter feat.) \nSpeaking to HuffPost on Thursday not even 48 hours after her victory, Tlaib said her barrier-breaking win was \u201coverwhelming, but also very inspiring.\u201d Last month, the Detroit-born daughter of Palestinian immigrants\u00a0told HuffPost she just wanted \u201cpeople like me to have a seat at the table.\u201d \n\u201cWhen you think about these stories \u2015 someone that didn\u2019t speak English when they started school, parents with no high school diploma now able to witness their daughter to become a member of Congress \u2015 it\u2019s a pretty spectacular American story,\u201d she said.\nTlaib shared that her family members still living in the West Bank \u2015 where her roots are \u201cstill very strong\u201d \u2015 were \u201cabsolutely proud\u201d of her win, particularly her grandmother.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be a voice for them,\u201d Tlaib said, lamenting the \u201cwalls and fences\u201d that separate Palestinians and Israelis, \u201ctwo people who have so much more in common.\u201d \n\u201cI look forward to being able to humanize so many of them that have felt \u2018less than\u2019 for so long,\u201d she added.\nTlaib won a tight primary race on Tuesday, partly with the backing of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, another progressive woman of color now famous for her upset win in New York in June. Tlaib plans to send some members of her own campaign field team to help get out the vote for Omar, whose primary is in Minnesota next week. \n\u201cIt feels incredible to be part of a movement,\u201d the mother of two said. She is one of a record wave of Muslim candidates and unprecedented number of\u00a0female candidates running for office in 2018. \n\u201cAll of these women of color are changing the landscape of Congress,\u201d she said. \nHere\u2019s more from Tlaib on what she hopes to achieve as a congresswoman.\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity. \nYou\u2019re from Michigan, about to make history representing part of the state, which has a significant Muslim and Arab-American community. What have you heard from people on what your win and representation means to them? \nI\u2019ve gotten hundreds of text messages and Facebook messages. What\u2019s incredible is it\u2019s not just Muslim women, it\u2019s women of color, white women, all women. I was just talking to [Michigan state Rep.]\u00a0Stephanie Chang, who said, \u201cI cried the moment your mom hugged you.\u201d \nAt a very painful time in our country, it felt incredible to have this loving American Dream story. \nWhat\u2019s the importance of being Congress\u2019 first Palestinian-American female member?\nIt\u2019s incredible \u2015 for me as Arab-American, being Palestinian-American and having my roots still very strongly there. My grandmother is still there, looking from afar just absolutely proud. She said in Arabic: \u201cYou\u2019ve lifted our heads.\u201d \nI\u2019m going to be \u2026 someone who understands the importance that we\u2019re humanizing that issue. \u00a0\nLast time I was there [in the West Bank], looking at the walls and fences and understanding the segregation of the two people [Palestinians and Israelis], who have so much more in common. Seeing the attacks and violence on innocent children is not getting us closer to peace. \nWhat do you hope to change in regard to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict once you\u2019re in Congress? \nIt\u2019s so hard to watch the walls go up, the checkpoints go up, the \u201cus versus them.\u201d\nGoing to the beach in Tel Aviv and people getting out of the water because we got in \u2026 That kind of experience is what I bring. Those are the stories and human impact that hasn\u2019t been told.\nWhen we start talking about those things, you see barriers go down and start understanding the approach by leadership right now is not going to help get us closer to peace in that region. \nI want to integrate schools. I tell my colleague on the House floor who is Jewish: \u201cCan you imagine, if we start integrating schools and have Israeli and Palestinian kids going to school together?\u201d \nWe did it in America, we can do it ... We should be riding the bus together. That\u2019s when everyone can live in a safe, peaceful environment. That approach is what\u2019s been missing.\nYou\u2019re part of a growing number of candidates and politicians calling to \u201cabolish\u201d Immigration and Customs Enforcement. What does that look like once you\u2019re in office? \nDefund it. And move that money toward real comprehensive immigration reform. \nHave you heard from fellow progressive female candidates Ocasio and Omar since your win? \nIt\u2019s great. Alexandria [Ocasio] reached out right away, I spoke to her the next morning \u2015 she said, \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d Ilhan [Omar] said, \u201cI need some people power.\u201d I said, \u201cI got the right team.\u201d I\u2019m going to try to be there [for Minnesota\u2019s primary]. I want to come hug her, walk with her. \nWe just want to work. Ilhan and I are moms. We see with this Trump administration, our children are struggling with their identity, struggling to feel equal to people around them. For us, this is about that more than anything else. \nI can\u2019t wait to start a \u201cMoms against Trump\u201d caucus. And I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if some of my Republican colleagues came on board. If you just had us moms get in a room, we could probably fix the awful gun crisis in our country in a few hours. \u00a0", "date": "\n08/09/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/rashida-tlaib-palestinian-congress_n_5b6cc8a2e4b0bdd06207d5aa", "tags": "tlaib rashida \u2018 going candidates palestinians win wants \u201d \u2015 humanize congress"}
