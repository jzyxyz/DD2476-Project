{"title": "A GOP Congressman Just Made An Argument For White Supremacy On Live TV", "content": "Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) made an outrageous statement about the contributions of Western civilization \u2015 i.e., the one crafted primarily by white people \u2015 over \u201cany other subgroup\u201d during an appearance Monday on MSNBC.\nAnother guest, Esquire editor-at-large Charlie Pierce, noted that the Republican National Convention was likely to be \u201cwired by loud, unhappy, dissatisfied white people\u201d who wouldn\u2019t tolerate any sign of party rebellion. Chaos had erupted earlier in the day after opponents of Donald Trump attempted to\u00a0derail his nomination.\nKing retorted that he was tired of efforts to blame\u00a0\u201cwhite people.\u201d And then he took it a step further, as is the congressman\u2019s wont: He suggested that white people are actually responsible for most of the good in the world.\nAnother member of the panel, White House correspondent April Ryan, fired back asking, \u201cWhat about Africa? What about Asia?\u201d\nHayes stepped in to end the discussion with a rather pointed pronouncement.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to argue the history of Western civilization,\u201d he said. \u201cLet me note for the record that if you\u2019re looking at the ledger for Western civilization, [in] every flourishing democracy you\u2019ve got Hitler and Stalin as well, so there\u2019s a lot on both sides.\u201d\nHayes tweeted about the interview shortly afterward, saying that he was \u201cpretty taken aback\u201d by King\u2019s comments, but that arguing over such a statement was \u201codious\u201d:\nPierce\u2019s initial comment that the Republican convention would be full of \u201cdissatisfied white people\u201d was actually spot on. Trump is popular with conservative white Americans, but has almost no support among key minority voting groups. Recent polling found just 6 percent of black voters and less than one-third of Hispanics planned to support him.\nAs for King, he made headlines last month after a failed attempt to block the Treasury Department from putting abolitionist and women\u2019s suffrage advocate Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill. He called the plan \u201cdivisive\u201d and said he\u2019d rather \u201ckeep what we have.\u201d", "date": "\n07/18/2016", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/steve-king-white-people-western-civilization_n_578d5f34e4b0a0ae97c320ed", "tags": "congressman supremacy tv western live argument gop civilization white \u201d \u2015 statement king made"}
