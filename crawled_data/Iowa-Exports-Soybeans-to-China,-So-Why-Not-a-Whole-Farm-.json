{"title": "Iowa Exports Soybeans to China, So Why Not a Whole Farm?", "content": "BEIJING \u2014 Iowa\u2019s governor, Terry Branstad, hopes to be America\u2019s next ambassador to China, and if he is confirmed as President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s envoy in Beijing, his new home there may be just three hours\u2019 drive from a transplanted patch of his home state.\nPlans are afoot to build a \u201cmodel farm\u201d in northern China inspired by one in Iowa that Xi Jinping visited in early 2012, before he became China\u2019s president. The idea has highlighted Mr. Xi\u2019s peculiarly long relationship with the Midwestern state and with Mr. Branstad, who was Iowa\u2019s governor from 1983 to 1999 and then returned to office in 2011.\nThe farm is still just a proposal, according to Chinese officials and Iowans involved in the discussions. But in a few years visitors to Chengde, in Hebei Province, may be able to stop at an Iowa-style farm, perhaps even including a replica of the home that Mr. Xi visited. And these days, anywhere that Mr. Xi visits has official pulling power in China.\n\u201cThere is a strong desire, somewhat, to retrace President Xi\u2019s footsteps and also to understand how we do things, because President Xi has held us up as an example,\u201d Grant Kimberley, whose parents\u2019 farm in Iowa hosted Mr. Xi and inspired the proposed model, said in a telephone interview. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s a motivation for the project.\u201d\nAs well as considering building a copy of the Kimberleys\u2019 family farm, Chinese officials may \u201ceven recreate a Midwestern community, and make it almost a tourist area,\u201d said Mr. Kimberley, who is director of market development for the Iowa Soybean Association.\nThe proposed project would cover 1,000 acres, with about a third of the area for the model farm. It would show off modern, mechanized agriculture in China, which is grappling with how to turn its fragmented farms into more efficient family operations that can feed almost 1.4 billion people while raising rural incomes.\nBut the proposal also shows how Mr. Xi\u2019s ties to rural Iowa have become a symbolic salve, used by both the Chinese government and now the incoming Trump administration to soften tensions with folksy good will. Mr. Trump has in recent days turned to Twitter to jab at the Chinese government over Taiwan, the South China Sea and trade frictions.\nAfter Mr. Trump proposed him as his ambassador on Wednesday, Mr. Branstad emphasized his ties with Mr. Xi, which go back over three decades, when Mr. Xi visited Iowa as an obscure county official in Hebei.\n\u201cDuring our 30-year friendship, President Xi Jinping and I have developed a respect and admiration for each other, our people and our cultures,\u201d Mr. Branstad said in comments on the Iowa governor\u2019s website. \u201cThe president-elect understands my unique relationship to China.\u201d\nAt a rally in Des Moines on Thursday, Mr. Trump suggested that Mr. Branstad\u2019s connections with China made him the right person to deliver tough demands in Beijing on rebalancing trade, subduing North Korea and other contentious issues.\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t played by the rules, and they know it\u2019s time that they\u2019re going to change,\u201d Mr. Trump said of China. He also suggested, without evidence, that Mr. Branstad had identified Mr. Xi as China\u2019s future leader many years ago.\nBack in 1985, Mr. Xi led a small delegation of Chinese officials to Iowa to study farming. He briefly met Mr. Branstad, then in his first stint as governor, and stayed for a couple of nights with a family in Muscatine, a small city in the rural eastern part of the state.\nIn 2012, as China\u2019s vice president and national leader-in-waiting, Mr. Xi returned to Iowa and visited the farm of Rick and Martha Kimberley in Maxwell, about 25 miles northeast of Des Moines, where they grow soybeans and corn on 4,000 acres.\nMore than 25 percent of the American soybean harvest is exported to China, and Iowa is a major producer. Mr. Xi wanted to understand how the farm worked and asked about equipment, storage and marketing, said Grant Kimberley, who was there for the visit, as was Mr. Branstad.\n\u201cHe sees agriculture could be like the ballast of the relationship,\u201d said Mr. Kimberley, paraphrasing something that Mr. Xi said on his visit to the Kimberleys\u2019 farm.\nThe Des Moines Register first reported on the plan for the model farm last month during Mr. Branstad\u2019s most recent visit to China to promote trade. Preliminary agreements were signed then by the local government in Chengde, a company representing the Kimberleys and Iowan supporters, and a Chinese bank that may provide funding.\nBut there are many details about what will be on the proposed farm that need to be ironed out, and the idea of cloning the Kimberleys\u2019 brick ranch-style home remains just an idea, said Kim Heidemann, the executive director of the Iowa Sister States organization, which helps oversee the state\u2019s relationship with Hebei Province.\n\u201cI am unsure if that will actually happen,\u201d she said about the replica home. \u201cBut of course the machinery, grain bins, et cetera, will for sure be built. This will be a working farm that will showcase the way that Iowans farm.\u201d\nThe government in Chengde is arranging investments for the project. And if the money and approvals come through, construction could start as soon as next year, said Mr. Kimberley, whose parents have visited Chengde to discuss the plan and scout sites.\nBut replicating even a little patch of Iowa could be tricky. In China, farmland is in theory collectively owned by villages but effectively controlled by the government, and farmers hold leases over patches of land. Some may have to give up land to make way for the model farm.\n\u201cThe farmers in the area will be a part of the operation,\u201d Ms. Heidemann said.\nStill, officials in Hebei appeared gung-ho about what they call the \u201cSino-American Friendship Model Farm.\u201d\n\u201cThe model farm will introduce advanced crop varieties, farming equipment and techniques from Iowa,\u201d Ye Changqing, an official who helps deal with Hebei\u2019s foreign ties, said at a meeting in July to discuss the plans. \u201cThe farm will invite American farmers to run and manage it.\u201d\nFor Chinese officials, the plan also seems be an unmistakable act of homage to Mr. Xi, a powerful leader whose image is jealously guarded. Since Mr. Xi visited the Kimberleys, many other Chinese officials have made their way there.\n\u201cI would say that we have a couple of Chinese government or business representatives coming to our farm every month,\u201d Grant Kimberley said.", "date": "Dec. 9, 2016", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/09/world/asia/china-iowa-farm-branstad-xi.html", "tags": "xi china farm iowa \u201d soybeans chinese branstad exports whole"}
