{"title": "Defender of World Order or Trump Mouthpiece? Pompeo Is Tested by North Korea, Iran and U.S. Allies", "content": "WARSAW \u2014 In the eyes of Mike Pompeo, the day was shaping up to be one of his most commanding displays of diplomacy since becoming secretary of state. Months of planning had finally yielded a meeting among reluctant European officials, Arab leaders and the Israeli prime minister to strategize over confronting Iran.\nThen, in a lunchtime speech, Vice President Mike Pence shattered the fragile unity.\nAddressing the officials as they met this month in Warsaw, Mr. Pence denounced the United States\u2019 closest allies \u2014 Britain, France and Germany \u2014 for coddling \u201cIran\u2019s murderous revolutionary regime.\u201d He demanded they stop undermining American-led sanctions and follow President Trump in renouncing a nuclear deal the Europeans were trying to save.\nPrivately, Mr. Pompeo briefly erupted. Aides said he complained Mr. Pence had undermined diplomacy \u2014 which one European official said included near-agreement about imposing new sanctions on Iran\u2019s ballistic missile tests \u2014 and prompted fresh headlines about trans-Atlantic tensions.\nBut publicly, Mr. Pompeo never voiced his anger, keeping relations with the White House stable.\nAlmost a year into his job, Mr. Pompeo, 55, has managed to pull off what few other Trump-era senior cabinet members have accomplished \u2014 staying in the president\u2019s good graces and wielding power without countering White House pronouncements or policies.\nNow he faces his greatest test. This week, Mr. Pompeo will accompany Mr. Trump to a summit meeting in Hanoi, Vietnam, to try to keep an effort to rid North Korea of its nuclear weapons from going off the rails.\nMr. Pompeo must keep Mr. Trump, 72, from being duped by the North\u2019s wily leader, Kim Jong-un, who is half the president\u2019s age. He also needs to prevent the president from undermining the American negotiating position on denuclearization. After meeting with Mr. Kim in June in Singapore, Mr. Trump declared that the matter was \u201clargely solved\u201d and that \u201cthere is no longer a nuclear threat\u201d from North Korea \u2014 contradicting American intelligence agencies, whose judgments the president largely ignores. Mr. Pompeo told CNN on Sunday that the North remains a nuclear threat.\nIn private discussions with Korea experts, Mr. Pompeo has conceded that he would be lucky if the North agreed to dismantle 60 percent of what the United States has demanded. But he said even that would be more than any other administration has achieved.\nOver all, Mr. Pompeo has been more of an evangelist for the president\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach than any other cabinet member. Whether he should serve as a megaphone for Mr. Trump and the White House, or be more strident in confronting the president over the uncomfortable realities of foreign policy, is now the central question of Mr. Pompeo\u2019s leadership of the United States\u2019 diplomatic corps.\nOthers in the administration wince at presidential tweets. Mr. Pompeo, a former Tea Party Republican congressman and C.I.A. director, tells his staff to evaluate each one on whether it can be leveraged into something useful.\nSometimes he works behind the scenes to try to contain the damage, but rarely drops any hint of his opposition in public.\nAfter Mr. Trump abruptly declared in December that the United States would soon withdraw its 2,000 troops from Syria, the defense secretary, Jim Mattis, resigned. But Mr. Pompeo told aides the withdrawal was the president\u2019s prerogative and defended it as a \u201cchange in tactics, not in mission.\u201d\nStill, he is not always in step with Mr. Trump. He has pushed ahead with sanctions against Russia, and in Poland, he watched American and Polish troops in a live-fire exercise near the Russian border \u2014 an unsubtle message to Moscow not to test the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\nBut generally, Mr. Pompeo, a strong partisan and ideologue, aligns with Mr. Trump. In a scathing nationalistic speech in Brussels in December, Mr. Pompeo criticized institutions the United States helped create to maintain its global power \u2014 the United Nations, European Union, World Bank, International Monetary Fund and World Trade Organization.\nIn a January speech in Cairo, Mr. Pompeo  attacked the policies of President Barack Obama. There has been little, if any, precedent for such a broadside of former administrations from a sitting secretary of state. Mr. Pompeo was widely criticized for it. By contrast, he praised President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, Egypt\u2019s repressive leader. He did the same with two other leaders who have authoritarian tendencies, President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil and Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary.\nOn major issues, \u201cthe president is working to undermine us, and if Secretary Pompeo is supporting that, this is a fault,\u201d said R. Nicholas Burns, an under secretary of state under President George W. Bush and a Harvard professor whom Mr. Pompeo has consulted.\n\u201cHe\u2019s an institutionalist, and he\u2019s done some things well, starting with rejuvenating the State Department after Rex Tillerson dismantled so much,\u201d Mr. Burns said, referring to the president\u2019s first secretary of state. \u201cBut on policy, he has been the voice of unilateralism, of \u2018our way or the highway.\u2019 And he\u2019s discovering, just recently, that the world is pushing back.\u201d\nThis article is based on conversations with more than two dozen current and former American officials, foreign diplomats and policy advisers, most of whom agreed to discuss Mr. Pompeo on the condition of anonymity.\nJohn R. Bolton, the national security adviser, sometimes expresses his own views and tries to bend policy, as he did on Syria, when he said American troops would stay as long as Iran had troops on Syrian soil. Mr. Trump quickly quashed that thought.\nBy contrast, Mr. Pompeo unfailingly sticks to the presidential line. For example, he publicly refuses to acknowledge the intelligence agencies\u2019 assessments \u2014 including those prepared by his former staff at the C.I.A. \u2014 that contradict Mr. Trump on matters like North Korea, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the Islamic State.\nThe president has rewarded Mr. Pompeo\u2019s loyalty by anointing him the point person on several signature issues. Those include North Korea and  Afghanistan, a subject on which one American official said Mr. Pompeo and Mr. Trump speak directly to each other, sidelining Mr. Bolton.\nMr. Pompeo, an evangelical Christian, also talks of global religious freedom as a priority.\nThe American foreign policy establishment is ambivalent toward Mr. Pompeo, praising him for reinvigorating the diplomatic corps while criticizing him for his policies and ideology.\nAfter he took over the State Department last April, Mr. Pompeo promised to return \u201cswagger\u201d to the ranks, which had been depleted and demoralized under Mr. Tillerson. He resumed hiring young diplomats and appointed respected career officials to  top positions. Still, many ambassadorships remain empty, which he blames on a Senate backlog.\nMr. Pompeo is much more in sync with Mr. Trump on policy than with career foreign service officers, whose recommendations often contradict the White House. Mr. Pompeo supported the president\u2019s decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal \u2014 two of Mr. Obama\u2019s signature initiatives that many American diplomats enthusiastically backed.\nMr. Trump\u2019s move to withdraw American troops from Syria shocked Brett McGurk, who served for more than four years as the special envoy to the coalition fighting the Islamic State. Mr. McGurk resigned and was swiftly labeled a \u201cgrandstander\u201d by the president. Mr. Pompeo remained silent and on the sidelines.\nShortly after the first meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim, the North\u2019s leader, Mr. Pompeo began trying to turn their vague communiqu\u00e9 from Singapore into a road map for denuclearization.\nIt was not easy. Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets that the problems were solved led Russia and China to loosen restrictions on trade with North Korea. When Mr. Pompeo visited Pyongyang, the North\u2019s capital, in July, Mr. Kim refused to see him. And Mr. Pompeo got nowhere on persuading North Korea to declare its nuclear assets.\nMonths later, the priorities have changed. While Mr. Trump once talked about swift movement on denuclearization, he has since said there is plenty of time.\nMr. Pompeo\u2019s chief envoy for North Korea, Stephen E. Biegun, signaled in a January speech that Pyongyang might not need to disclose its nuclear assets until later in the process \u2014 raising questions in the National Security Council and among arms experts about how they would know if Mr. Kim had actually reduced his arsenal. Had Mr. Pompeo moved the goal posts?\nIn Hanoi, Mr. Pompeo\u2019s largest challenge will be to extract from Mr. Kim a timetable for dismantling his nuclear program. He must also reconcile how the United States and the North define denuclearization, and wants to keep Mr. Trump from having much time alone with Mr. Kim, where the president might make snap concessions.\nWhile Mr. Pompeo still insists \u201ccomplete, verifiable denuclearization\u201d of the Korean Peninsula is the goal, he says Pyongyang may begin to receive benefits \u2014 perhaps a liaison office \u2014 as he seeks to \u201creduce the threat from a nuclear-armed North Korea.\u2019\u2019\nTo some, that word, \u201creduce,\u201d is a sign of a creeping acceptance of reality.\nA senior aide said Mr. Pompeo \u201chas been all about Iran,\u201d dating to his time in Congress. His forceful approach has incited tensions with European allies and the Iraqi government, whose support the Trump administration needs to keep American troops there.\nMr. Pompeo is banking that sanctions  on Iran will compel political change there. In Warsaw, Mr. Pompeo said he hoped the Iranian people would rise up against their autocratic government, which he has criticized for its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and regional military campaigns.\nTo his frustration, the European countries that negotiated the nuclear deal alongside the United States \u2014 Britain, France, Germany \u2014 refuse to follow Washington\u2019s lead. They are working to keep Iran in the deal and to continue trade. Few other issues have so poisoned relations with allies.\nThe same is true in Baghdad, where Mr. Pompeo pressed Iraqi leaders in January to stop buying energy from neighboring Iran. Weeks later, the Iraqi prime minister said he would not abide by American sanctions, given that natural gas and electricity from Iran are critical for power-starved Iraq. And in September, over the objections of Iraqi officials and some American diplomats, Mr. Pompeo closed the United States Consulate in Basra, citing concerns about Iran.\nMr. Pompeo has followed Mr. Trump\u2019s lead in reaffirming ties with Saudi Arabia, Iran\u2019s main adversary, despite concerns from even  Senate Republicans about the kingdom\u2019s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. No other issue has been more telling of Mr. Pompeo\u2019s support of the transactional nature of Mr. Trump\u2019s foreign policy.\nIn October, following the crisis that erupted after Saudi agents  killed  Jamal Khashoggi, a Virginia resident and Washington Post columnist, Mr. Trump sent Mr. Pompeo on an emergency trip to Saudi Arabia. Images of Mr. Pompeo smiling and shaking hands with Prince Mohammed ignited widespread criticism.\nAfter another visit in January with the prince, who is waging a catastrophic war in Yemen and whom the C.I.A. has concluded ordered Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s murder, Mr. Pompeo told reporters accompanying him that the United States had \u201ca deep, longstanding relationship\u201d with Saudi Arabia.\n\u201cThat\u2019s who our partner is; that\u2019s who our strategically shared interest is with,\u201d he said.\nOn Jan. 4, Mr. Pompeo appeared on a video screen in a room in Lima, Peru. He was speaking to officials from 13 nations who had gathered for a meeting of the Lima Group, formed in 2017 to address the economic crisis in Venezuela.\nThey were weighing what actions to take against President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, the authoritarian leader of Venezuela. The Canadian envoy was pressing for a declaration on the illegitimacy of Mr. Maduro\u2019s government. Others were unsure.\nMr. Pompeo delivered the same message he had made in person days earlier to leaders of Brazil and Colombia: Come up with a solid plan, and the United States will stand with you.\nThat helped push the countries to issue a bold statement demanding that Mr. Maduro not start another term, said two people briefed on the discussions.\nThen a debate unfolded in the State Department over whether the United States should take the same step. Some officials recommended caution. But Mr. Pompeo chose to take a stronger approach, one person said, helping prompt the Trump administration\u2019s first overt attempt at regime change.\nOn Jan. 23, Mr. Trump announced he recognized Juan Guaid\u00f3, the National Assembly leader, as Venezuela\u2019s interim president.\nIn those early weeks, diplomacy was a success for Mr. Pompeo.\n\u201cEither you stand with the forces of freedom or you\u2019re in league with Maduro and his mayhem,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said at a United Nations Security Council meeting. On Feb. 4, most of the European Union\u2019s members recognized Mr. Guaid\u00f3.\nBut Mr. Pompeo\u2019s new special representative for Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, is known for a contentious history with Latin America that involves violence and what some call imperial overreach.\nAnd the Venezuelan military still supports Mr. Maduro. Since Friday, pro-Maduro forces have killed at least four civilians in clashes over American aid supplies.\nMr. Pompeo\u2019s diplomacy may have reached its limits. Roberta S. Jacobson, a former assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere Affairs, said Mr. Pompeo had failed to cultivate the deep international ties now required.\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t engaged in creating relationships and supporting the international institutions that you need when you want allies to be with you at a tough time,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead, we go it alone.\u201d", "date": "Feb. 24, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/24/us/politics/secretary-of-state-mike-pompeo.html", "tags": "allies iran world korea mouthpiece u.s. president united \u201d trump pompeo order north \u2014 tested defender"}
