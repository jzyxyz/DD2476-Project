{"title": "'Game Of Thrones' Creators Spark Controversy With Next HBO Show", "content": "As\u00a0\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d is left with just a dozen more episodes, series co-creators and showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss are looking ahead to their next project: \u201cConfederate.\u201d\nAlthough details are sparse, the upcoming show has already sparked criticism on social media over its premise. Following a popular subgenre of historical fiction that imagines a world where the South won the Civil War, \u201cConfederate\u201d envisions an alternate version of the United States that has already been ravaged by two civil wars, with slavery still legal in the South.\nIt\u2019s set to begin production after \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d wraps its eighth and final season. Here\u2019s the full description from HBO:\n\u201cWe have discussed \u2018Confederate\u2019\u00a0for years, originally as a concept for a feature film,\u201d Benioff and Weiss said in a statement. \u201cBut our experience on \u2018Thrones\u2019 has convinced us that no one provides a bigger, better storytelling canvas than HBO. There won\u2019t be dragons or White Walkers in this series, but we are creating a world, and we couldn\u2019t imagine better partners in world-building than Nichelle [Tramble Spellman] and Malcolm [Spellman], who have impressed us for a long time with their wit, their imagination and their Scrabble-playing skills.\u201d\nImmediately after the announcement, critics questioned the political timing of a show helmed by two white men seemingly poised to spotlight perspectives of white supremacists.\nIts title, if not specifically intended to cause controversy, seems to willfully overlook the current, ugly debate surrounding the Confederate battle flag, which has reignited in recent years. Many consider the flag a symbol of racism and hate.\u00a0\nSome also called out a perceived tokenism in the HBO announcement. The Spellmans, who\u2019ve worked on \u201cThe Good Wife\u201d and \u201cEmpire,\u201d respectively, are writers of color. They\u2019ll partner as executive producers and writers on the series along with two veterans of \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d which \u2015 despite its smash success \u2015 has faced questions of promoting a white savior narrative.\u00a0\n\u201cWhose fantasy is this?\u201d asked a social critic who goes by Son of Baldwin and runs a popular Facebook page.\nSeason 7 of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d\u00a0is currently airing on HBO. The Season 8 premiere date has not yet been decided, but \u201cConfederate\u201d will likely air in 2018 or 2019.", "date": "\n07/19/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-game-of-thrones-creators-next-show-is-called-confederate_n_596fd0cbe4b0aa14ea76e9e6?v25", "tags": "next game hbo show season confederate series \u201d white controversy two creators thrones spark"}
