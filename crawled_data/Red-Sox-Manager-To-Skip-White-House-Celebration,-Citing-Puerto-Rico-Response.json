{"title": "Red Sox Manager To Skip White House Celebration, Citing Puerto Rico Response", "content": "Boston Red Sox manager Alex Cora said he will not attend a White House event Thursday celebrating his team\u2019s 2018 World Series win, citing the Trump administration\u2019s response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico.\nCora, who was born and raised in the U.S. island territory, told Puerto Rican newspaper El Nuevo D\u00eda on Sunday that he doesn\u2019t \u201cfeel comfortable\u201d celebrating at the White House when so many back home are still struggling.\n\u201cEven though the United States government has helped, there\u2019s still a long road ahead,\u201d Cora told the paper,\u00a0according to a translated version of the story. \u201cThat is OUR reality. I\u2019ve used my voice on many occasions so that Puerto Ricans are not forgotten and my absence [from the White House] is no different.\u201d\nPuerto Rico is still recovering after Hurricane Maria devastated the island in September 2017, leaving millions without power for months. The storm and its brutal aftermath claimed nearly 3,000 lives, according to a study from George Washington University\u2019s Milken Institute School of Public Health.\nDespite Hurricane Maria\u2019s status as one of the deadliest natural disasters on record, President Donald Trump and the Federal Emergency Management Agency failed to treat it as such and were slow to allocate aid, according to some Puerto Rican officials and Democratic lawmakers. Trump has ridiculed the crisis and personally attacked Puerto Rico leaders who complained.\n\u201cThe government has done some things back home that are great, but we still have a long ways to go,\u201d Cora told The Associated Press on Sunday, following his team\u2019s 9-2 win over the Chicago White Sox. \u201cThat\u2019s our reality. It\u2019s pretty tough to go celebrate when we\u2019re where we\u2019re at.\u201d\nSeveral Red Sox players, including David Price, Hector Velazquez and Xander Bogaerts, also have said they will skip the White House event.\nThe Red Sox organization fully supports \u201ceveryone\u2019s personal decisions\u201d regarding the White House celebration, a team spokesman said.\n\u201cWe are grateful to our ownership group for creating a culture where we discuss these issues openly, and encourage individual decision making,\u201d the spokesman told HuffPost in a statement. \u201cWe also appreciate Alex for talking openly with our team and supporting those who are looking forward to being honored on Thursday.\u201d\nThe White House did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment.\nThis article has been updated with comment from a Red Sox spokesman.", "date": "\n05/06/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/red-sox-alex-cora-white-house_n_5cd01d07e4b04e275d4d5133", "tags": "skip citing manager cora red rico celebration team white house \u201d puerto response told sox"}
