{"title": "Spy Agency Consensus Grows That Russia Hacked D.N.C.", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 American intelligence agencies have told the White House they now have \u201chigh confidence\u201d that the Russian government was behind the theft of emails and documents from the Democratic National Committee, according to federal officials who have been briefed on the evidence.\nBut intelligence officials have cautioned that they are uncertain whether the electronic break-in at the committee\u2019s computer systems was intended as fairly routine cyberespionage \u2014 of the kind the United States also conducts around the world \u2014 or as part of an effort to manipulate the 2016 presidential election.\nThe emails were released by WikiLeaks, whose founder, Julian Assange, has made it clear that he hoped to harm Hillary Clinton\u2019s chances of winning the presidency. It is unclear how the documents made their way to the group. But a large sampling was published before the WikiLeaks release by several news organizations and someone who called himself \u201cGuccifer 2.0,\u201d who investigators now believe was an agent of the G.R.U., Russia\u2019s military intelligence service.\nThe assessment by the intelligence community of Russian involvement in the D.N.C. hacking, which largely echoes the findings of private cybersecurity firms that have examined the electronic fingerprints left by the intruders, leaves President Obama and his national security aides with a difficult diplomatic and political decision: whether to publicly accuse the government of President Vladimir V. Putin of engineering the hacking.\nSuch a public accusation could result in a further deterioration of the already icy relationship between Washington and Moscow, at a moment when the administration is trying to reach an accord with Mr. Putin on a cease-fire in Syria and on other issues. It could also doom any effort to reach some kind of agreement about acceptable behavior in cyberspace, of the kind the United States has been discussing with China.\nIn an interview with Savannah Guthrie of NBC News on Tuesday, President Obama stopped short of accusing the Russian agencies from seeking to manipulate the election but said, \u201cAnything\u2019s possible.\u201d\nHe noted that \u201con a regular basis, they try to influence elections in Europe.\u201d\nStealing information about another country\u2019s political infighting is hardly new, and the United States has conducted covert collection from allies like Germany and adversaries like Russia for decades. Publishing the documents \u2014 what some have called \u201cweaponizing\u201d them \u2014 is a different issue. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign has suggested that Mr. Putin was trying to even the score after the former secretary of state denounced a 2011 Russian election as filled with fraud.\n\u201cThe first thing that the secretary of state did was say that they were not honest and not fair, but she had not even yet received the material from the observers,\u201d Mr. Putin said at the time. \u201cShe set the tone for some actors in our country and gave them a signal,\u201d Mr. Putin continued. \u201cThey heard the signal and, with the support of the U.S. State Department, began active work.\u201d\nCampaign officials have also suggested that Mr. Putin could be trying to tilt the election to Donald J. Trump. But they acknowledge that they have no evidence.\nAsked on Tuesday at the Democratic convention in Philadelphia whether \u201cthere\u2019s more to the Trump/Russian relationship that hasn\u2019t come out,\u201d John Podesta, the Clinton campaign chairman, said, \u201cWell, he certainly has a bromance with Mr. Putin, so I don\u2019t know.\u201d\nMr. Podesta said that while Russia had a \u201chistory\u201d of interfering in democratic elections in Europe, it would be \u201cunprecedented in the United States.\u201d\nThe Republican platform, adopted last week in Cleveland, calls on the United States to \u201crespond in kind and in greater magnitude\u201d to cyberattacks. \u201cRussia and China see cyber operations as part of a warfare strategy during peacetime,\u201d it says. \u201cOur response should be to cause diplomatic, financial and legal pain.\u201d\nBut the Trump campaign has dismissed the accusations about Russia as a deliberate distraction, meant to draw attention away from the content of nearly 20,000 emails and documents from the Democratic committee that WikiLeaks started releasing on Friday. They showed efforts to impugn Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in his effort to challenge Mrs. Clinton for the nomination.\nOn Twitter Tuesday night, Mr. Trump said that in order to deflect \u201cthe horror and stupidity of the Wikileakes disaster,\u201d Democrats were saying: \u201cRussia is dealing with Trump. Crazy!\u201d\n\u201cFor the record,\u201d he said, \u201cI have ZERO investments in Russia.\u201d\nMr. Obama, in his interview with NBC News, criticized Mr. Trump for suggesting last week that the United States should not defend from Russian aggression any country that does not contribute sufficient funds to NATO. He said Mr. Trump was \u201cundermining\u201d the country\u2019s post-World War II alliances in Europe.\nSecretary of State John Kerry raised the cyberattack with his Russian counterpart, Sergey V. Lavrov, on Tuesday at a meeting of foreign ministers in Vientiane, Laos. Mr. Lavrov dismissed the idea that Russia was involved, telling reporters who asked about the charges: \u201cI don\u2019t want to use four-letter words.\u201d\nMr. Kerry made no accusations, saying he had to allow the F.B.I. to \u201cdo its work\u201d before he drew \u201cany conclusions in terms of what happened or who\u2019s behind it.\u201d\nThe federal investigation, involving the F.B.I. and the intelligence agencies, has been going on since the Democratic National Committee first called in a private cybersecurity firm, Crowdstrike, in April.\nPreliminary conclusions were discussed on Thursday at a weekly cyberintelligence meeting for senior officials. The Crowdstrike report, supported by several other firms that have examined the same bits of code and telltale \u201cmetadata\u201d left on documents that were released before WikiLeaks\u2019 publication of the larger trove, concludes that the Federal Security Service, known as the F.S.B., entered the committee\u2019s networks last summer.\nThe G.R.U., a competing, military intelligence unit, was a later arrival. Investigators believe it is the G.R.U. that has played a bigger role in releasing the emails.\nIn an essay published on Lawfare, a blog that often deals with cyberissues, Susan Hennessey, previously a lawyer for the National Security Agency, called the published evidence about Russian involvement \u201cabout as close to a smoking gun as can be expected when a sophisticated nation-state is involved.\u201d\nMr. Assange\u2019s threat to release documents, she wrote, \u201cmeans, put simply, that actors outside the U.S. are using criminal means to influence the outcome of a US election. That\u2019s a problem.\u201d\nBut American intelligence agencies have their doubts that the Russian intention, at least initially, was to sway the American election. The intrusion began just shortly after Mr. Trump announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination. At the time, his chances looked minuscule. One senior official noted that while the cyberattack might have been intended to embarrass Mrs. Clinton, who was the presumptive nominee, it could not have been aimed at bolstering Mr. Trump.\nIt is far from clear that Mr. Obama or the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, would ever name Russia as the origin of the hack. Mr. Obama has only once accused a country of attacking an American organization, when he said North Korea was the source of the 2014 attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment. But the United States has no relationship with North Korea, and there was little to lose from identifying it.\nIn the case of Russia and China \u2014 countries with which the United States has complex relationships \u2014 Mr. Obama has in the past made the opposite decision. He never named the Russian intelligence agencies as the perpetrators of hacks on the State Department and White House unclassified email systems, or on the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\nWhile the administration has called out the People\u2019s Liberation Army of China for stealing intellectual property \u2014 even indicting officers of its now-inactive Unit 61398 \u2014 it never publicly accused the Chinese intelligence services of stealing the security-clearance files on more than 21 million Americans who held or applied for clearances.\nBy happenstance, the intelligence report on the Democratic National Committee hacking was circulating here the day that Mr. Obama issued a new policy, long in development, to organize the government\u2019s response to major cyberattacks and to set up a six-point \u201cgrading system\u201d to assess the severity of strikes against American companies, government agencies and organizations.\nThe action against the Democratic committee, they said, would qualify as a \u201csignificant cyber incident,\u201d which was defined as one that causes \u201cdemonstrable harm to the national security interests, foreign relations or economy of the United States, or to the public confidence, civil liberties or public health and safety of the American people.\u201d\nRanking the hacking in the pantheon of other penetrated networks is difficult. The top ranking under Mr. Obama\u2019s system would be reserved for an attack that disabled American power grids, for example, akin to the suspected Russian attack on Ukraine\u2019s electrical system in December. The attack on the Office of Personnel Management and Sony, which destroyed 70 percent of the studio\u2019s computers, would also rank above the \u201ccategory 3\u201d level, which defines a \u201csignificant\u201d attack.\nBut the ranking system does not mandate what kind of response the president would authorize. And it was designed before many in Washington imagined the use of cyberattacks to release information in the midst of a dizzying, and volatile, presidential campaign.", "date": "July 26, 2016", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/27/us/politics/spy-agency-consensus-grows-that-russia-hacked-dnc.html", "tags": "intelligence russian agency grows consensus united \u201d d.n.c states spy hacked russia \u2014"}
