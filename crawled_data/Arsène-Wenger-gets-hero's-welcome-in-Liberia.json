It is unbelievable. It can make a fantastic film.\"\nNot everyone has been as excited about his arrival. \nSome Liberians say that the honour should not have been given to an individual for what they had done for the president personally, according to the BBC's Jonathan Paye-Layleh in Monrovia. \nOn a Liberian morning radio show, called 50-50, some of the listeners who called in said Mr Weah should have honoured the Liberian coaches who trained him before he caught the eye of the international community.\nLiberia's Information Minister Eugene Nagbe told the BBC the award was not only about Weah's personal connection with Wenger, but was a way to recognize that the Frenchman had \"contributed to sports in Africa and has given many Africans opportunities\".\nWenger coached 16 African players at Arsenal, including Ivory Coast's Kolo Toure, Cameroon defender Lauren and Nigerian Nwankwo Kanu. \n All images subject to copyright", "date": "23 August 2018", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-45288089", "tags": "given country african liberian ars\u00e8ne weah hero arsenal gets wenger welcome liberia honour"}
