{"title": "Tony Abbott #PutYourOnionsOut: How the internet reacted", "content": "Following the news that Australia Prime Minister Tony Abbott has been ousted by Malcolm Turnbull, we round up the best internet reactions.\nOne of Mr Abbott's most memorable moments in office was his decision to bite in a raw onion while touring a farm in Tasmania. You can watch the video here.\nFollowing the news that he could be leaving office, the hashtag #PutOutYourOnions began to trend. It is a reference to #PutOutYourBats, which became a global phenomenon in 2014 as people left cricket bats outside their doors to mark the death of cricketer Phillip Hughes.\nTo mark Mr Abbott's political demise they've started leaving out onions.\nOthers took a more literal interpretation...\nSome thought that political musical chairs has become Australia's national pastime. Some enterprising editors amended the Sport in Australia Wikipedia page.\nSome users thought former Primer Minister Julia Gillard would find Mr Abbott's ousting amusing. She too lost office following a political coup by Kevin Rudd.\nTony Abbott's Twitter feed suggests his ousting came as something of a surprise. His last post was 12 hours before his eventual fall, and it focuses on more mundane matters than an impending political coup.\nMeanwhile, MP Clive Palmer paid his own, rather unique, video tribute to Mr Abbott. He wished him goodbye (quite a few times).\nAnd then once more for good measure.", "date": "14 September 2015", "href": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-34244573", "tags": "australia office minister abbott news political reacted tony following video internet putyouronionsout"}
