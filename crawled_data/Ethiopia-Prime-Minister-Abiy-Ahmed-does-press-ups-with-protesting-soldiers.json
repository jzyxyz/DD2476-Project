{"title": "Ethiopia Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed does press-ups with protesting soldiers", "content": "Ethiopia's prime minister has done press-ups with dozens of protesting soldiers, who had marched into his office in the capital, Addis Ababa.\nAbiy Ahmed was unhappy that soldiers had brought weapons and ordered them to do 10 press-ups.\nThey were among several hundred protesting soldiers who entered his office grounds to demand a pay rise.\nThe situation caused alarm, leading to road closures in the area and the internet to be shut off for hours.\nMany Ethiopians wondered whether this amounted to a serious security breach, says BBC Amharic's Jibat Tamirat.\nHowever, the smiles on the soldiers' faces as they performed the press-ups suggest the prime minister succeeded in defusing the situation amicably: \nThe soldiers began massing outside the presidential compound on Wednesday morning, causing a partial road block in the area, the BBC's Amharic service reports. \nAround half of them were armed with Kalashnikovs and sniper rifles.\nThey were told by the guards that they could not enter the sprawling grounds with their guns. \nContrary to previous reports, the soldiers were disarmed outside the compound. They were only allowed into the premises in the late afternoon and the road block was lifted. \nIt is not known how much they wanted their salaries to be increased by. \nBy Tibebeselassie Tigabu, BBC Amharic\nExperts are speculating that the protest was not as innocent as it first looked. \nA former brigadier general told BBC Amharic that the security breach was \"dangerous\" and \"an event which exposed the weakness of the military intelligence\".\nTheir demand was valid but the procedure soldiers followed violated military discipline, he said.  \nThe general speculated that this was not a spontaneous protest. It might have been orchestrated by a group, he said.  \nHe nonetheless thinks the prime minister deftly resolved the situation, even though the law clearly calls for disciplinary measures against the protesting soldiers.\nLegal expert Dereje Zeleke agrees. \n\"This shows that the military and intelligence apparatus are not willing to serve the new commander-in-chief or the reform he represents,\" he said. \nHe believes this was a message from a group resisting the many changes introduced by the prime minister since he came to power.\nAfter meeting the soldiers on Wednesday, Mr Abiy said he would \"look into their complaints\" but stressed that even civil servants had to make do with low salaries as the country had limited resources. \n\"We have to use the money for development purposes,\" he said according to a statement. \"We can pay everyone higher salaries but we will end up [with] no development.\"\nHe came to power in April after three years of protest led by ethnic Oromos, who were demanding an end to what they considered their political and economic marginalization.\nThe prime minister, who is Oromo himself, has passed a series of massive reforms, making peace with neighbouring Eritrea and releasing the state's tight grip on parts of the economy.\nHe has released thousands of political prisoners and unbanned groups, including the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF), which had been labelled terrorist organisations.", "date": "11 October 2018", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-45822161", "tags": "soldiers minister abiy situation prime road protesting amharic press-ups bbc ahmed ethiopia"}
