{"title": "\u2018Tim & Eric\u2019s Billion Dollar Movie,\u2019 From TV\u2019s Comedians", "content": "If you\u2019ve ever found yourself surfing after midnight through the cable wasteland, you may have chanced across \u201cTim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!\u201d on \u201cAdult Swim,\u201d the Cartoon Network\u2019s quirky programming block for insomniacs. Surreal live-action sketches in saturated color, lo-fi parodies of television ads and infomercials, and hits of gross-out humor predominate, courtesy of Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim, creators adept at cheesy effects. The show comes in at a digestible 15-minutes that ends before you know it, the satires side by side with the late-night sales pitches.\nNow comes \u201cTim & Eric\u2019s Billion Dollar Movie,\u201d a disposable trifle of fleeting rewards that \u2014 like many features built on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d sketches \u2014 shows its seams after three minutes. The story, as it is, concerns the pair\u2019s efforts to repay an extortionist (Robert Loggia) a billion dollars they have squandered on a bad movie. They answer an ad inviting them to resurrect a decrepit mall, granting opportunities to riff on silly store names. There the hapless Mr.\u00a0Wareheim falls in love, while the scheming Mr.\u00a0Heidecker adopts a boy from his father (don\u2019t ask).\nThis being partly a Funny or Die production, you get the Will Ferrell posse (Mr. Ferrell, Will Forte, John C. Reilly), as well as Zach Galifianakis and (in the \u201cGreat Job!\u201d tradition) cameos from the likes of Jeff Goldblum and Ray Wise. Regrettably, the laddie jokes (violence, bodily fluids, sexual accessories) outnumber the video pyrotechnics. But a valuable lesson is demonstrated anew: Less really can be more.\n\u201cTim & Eric\u2019s Billion Dollar Movie\u201d is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for strong language, inflatable sex dolls and decapitations played for laughs.", "date": "MARCH 2, 2012", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/03/movies/tim-erics-billion-dollar-movie-from-tvs-comedians.html", "tags": "eric tv \u2018 job billion tim show great movie \u201d dollar comedians"}
