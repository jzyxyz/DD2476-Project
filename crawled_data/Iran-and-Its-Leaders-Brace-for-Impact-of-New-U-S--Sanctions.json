{"title": "Iran and Its Leaders Brace for Impact of New U.S. Sanctions", "content": "TEHRAN \u2014 With an eye to the impending reimposition of American sanctions against Iran, Saeed Mohammadi, a 38-year-old plumber in Tehran, knew what he had to do.\nLast week, like many others, he bought $1,000 worth of gold, which has been rising steadily on the local market. \u201cI\u2019ll make a profit that will help me get by a bit,\u201d Mr. Mohammadi said.\nOn Monday, with the sanctions hours from kicking back in and Iran facing economic free-fall and social unrest, it became clear that the Iranian government had been trying to prepare for far longer. Some parts of its plan came together only in the final hours before the deadline passed.\nIn the months before the sanctions were reimposed, the government was hoarding foreign currency and cutting off unnecessary imports. But other imports were rushed in to beat the clock.\nOn Sunday night, five 70-seat turboprop passenger planes built by an Italian and French consortium landed at Mehrabad International Airport in Tehran, Iran\u2019s capital. Under the sanctions, Iran will once again be forbidden to buy new passenger jets for its fleet, despite deals that Iran Air has signed with Boeing and Airbus, and the need for safer aircraft: About 2,000 people have died in plane crashes in Iran in the past two decades.\nYet the country\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani, said on Monday night that Iran could withstand American pressure if Iranians joined together. Describing as \u201cpsychological warfare\u201d an offer President Trump made last month for talks \u201cwithout preconditions,\u201d Mr. Rouhani said Iran would need to see \u201csincerity\u201d from the United States in order to engage in any talks.\n\u201cThey are the ones who left the outcome of talks and the table of negotiations,\u201d Mr. Rouhani said, referring to Mr. Trump\u2019s decision in May to withdraw the United States from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six major powers.\n\u201cSomeone who offers to hold talks should initially prove that they aim at resolving issues through talks,\u201d the Iranian president added. \u201cWhat sense do negotiations make when they impose sanctions?\u201d\nHe nonetheless left open an option for talks, saying that \u201cIran has always welcomed negotiations, if there is sincerity.\u201d\nThe new American sanctions bar any transactions with Iran involving dollars, gold, precious metals, aluminum, steel, commercial passenger aircraft and coal. They also end imports into the United States of Iranian carpets and pistachio nuts, both of which are important symbols for Iranians. Another round of sanctions is due to be introduced on Nov. 4.\nThe other countries that signed the 2015 nuclear agreement \u2014 Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia \u2014 do not support the United States sanctions, which Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in May would be the \u201cstrongest in history.\u201d\nThe Iranian government tried to calm the markets on Monday before the sanctions were scheduled to begin, although it was unclear how effective those measures would be. Iran\u2019s currency, the rial, rose modestly for the day, but it has lost more than 80 percent of its value in the past 12 months. And while much of the devaluation stems from mismanagement and corruption, the United States\u2019 withdrawal from the nuclear agreement has exacerbated the rial\u2019s weakening.\nIran\u2019s new central banker, Abdolnaser Hemmati, on Sunday evening spoke of \u201ceconomic warfare\u201d by the United States, but also said in an interview on state television that Iran was \u201cpowerful.\u201d\nIn an attempt to ease the economic hardship in the country, he announced that starting on Monday, Iranians would no longer be restricted in the amount of dollars and gold they could bring in. An earlier rule capped that amount at 10,000 euros, or about $11,500.\nMr. Hemmati also announced that the government would subsidize medicine and food to ensure that essential goods could be bought. Mr. Rouhani said on Monday that 1,500 items would be banned from import to save foreign currency for more pressing items. And the central banker lifted a ban on currency trading that some economists say has worsened the crisis.\n\u201cAs the U.S. sanctions us, we are opening up our markets,\u201d said Mr. Hemmati, whose predecessor was placed on a United States sanctions list in May.\nThe central banker then cut short the television interview, saying that people should have fun instead of listening to boring things. \u201cWe have no worries,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy should the people be worried?\u201d\nOrdinary Iranians were not so carefree.\nIn southwestern Tehran on Monday, Amir Sherafari was closing down his modest fruit-and-vegetable shop. Together with his brother, who has a master\u2019s degree in political science, Mr. Sherafari, 38, has used up his father\u2019s savings to rent the store.\nIn recent weeks there have been no customers.\n\u201cPeople think twice about even buying an ice cream,\u201d Mr. Sherafari said, adding that he didn\u2019t think Mr. Rouhani could change the situation.\n\u201cHe is stuck between hard-liners and the Americans,\u201d the shopkeeper said of the president. \u201cI\u2019m thinking of becoming a taxi driver or migrating to Europe. That\u2019s the only solution.\u201d", "date": "Aug. 6, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/06/world/middleeast/iran-us-sanctions.html", "tags": "iran brace leaders sanctions mr. u.s. united states \u201d new impact monday talks"}
