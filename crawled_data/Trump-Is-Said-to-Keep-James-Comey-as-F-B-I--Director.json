{"title": "Trump Is Said to Keep James Comey as F.B.I. Director", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, told his top agents from around the country that he had been asked by President Trump to stay on the job running the federal government\u2019s top law enforcement agency, according to people familiar with the matter.\nA decision to retain Mr. Comey would spare the president another potentially bruising confirmation battle. It would also keep Mr. Comey at the center of the F.B.I.\u2019s investigation into several Trump associates and their potential ties with the Russian government.\nRetaining Mr. Comey could also help calm the bureau\u2019s work force, which has been rattled after a tumultuous few months in which the F.B.I. and the director himself were sharply criticized for moves that many felt influenced the outcome of the presidential election.\nDuring the campaign, Mr. Trump harshly criticized the F.B.I. and the Justice Department for not bringing criminal charges against Hillary Clinton in connection with her use of a personal email server. After Mr. Trump was elected in November, he said in a nationally televised interview that he had not made up his mind about whether he would ask Mr. Comey to resign.\nWhen Mr. Comey and the president-elect met at Trump Tower for the first time this month for an intelligence briefing, Mr. Trump told the F.B.I. director that he hoped he would remain in his position, according to people briefed on the matter. And Mr. Trump\u2019s aides have made it clear to Mr. Comey that the president does not plan to ask him to leave, these people said.\nThen, last Wednesday, during a weekly conference call, Mr. Comey relayed the news to his senior employees, who are known as special agents in charge.\nUnder federal law, the F.B.I. director is appointed to a 10-year term, intended to overlap more than one administration as part of post-Watergate overhauls created to give the director independence and insulate the job from politics. The president can fire the director, though. Mr. Comey, a former senior Justice Department official under President George W. Bush, was appointed by President Obama in 2013.\nThose who described the plans for the F.B.I. director spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to be identified discussing confidential conversations between Mr. Trump, his aides and Mr. Comey.\nRepresentatives for the F.B.I. and the White House declined to comment.\nOn Jan. 15, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief of staff, Reince Priebus, appeared on ABC News\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d program and signaled that Mr. Trump had no immediate desire to get rid of Mr. Comey.\n\u201cYes, he has confidence in Director Comey,\u201d Mr. Priebus said. \u201cWe have had a great relationship with him over the last several weeks. He\u2019s extremely competent. But, look, his term extends for some time yet. There\u2019s no plans at the moment in changing that term. And we\u2019ve enjoyed our relationship with him and find him to be extraordinarily competent.\u201d\nMr. Comey will have to manage an increasingly difficult relationship with Mr. Trump and his White House, as the F.B.I. is leading an investigation into ties between Mr. Trump\u2019s associates \u2014 including his former campaign manager, Paul Manafort \u2014 and the Russian government. As part of that inquiry, agents have examined intercepted communications and financial transactions. Mr. Comey has repeatedly declined to discuss the investigation with members of Congress.\nMrs. Clinton and many Democrats blame Mr. Comey for her defeat, and it is not clear whether she would have kept him on had she won.\nIn July, Mr. Comey held a news conference to announce that the bureau was recommending to the Justice Department that Mrs. Clinton or her aides not be charged in connection with the mishandling of classified information on her personal email server. At the news conference, Mr. Comey took the unusual step of criticizing how Mrs. Clinton and her aides handled classified information, saying it was \u201cextremely careless.\u201d\nThen, 11 days before the election, Mr. Comey sent a letter to Congress saying new emails that appeared related to the investigation had surfaced, which the bureau needed to analyze.\nThe letter set off a flurry of reports about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s personal email server. The emails had been found as part of an unrelated investigation into illicit text messages Anthony D. Weiner \u2014 the estranged husband of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s closest aide, Huma Abedin \u2014 had sent to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. Two days before the election, Mr. Comey sent another letter to Congress, saying that the emails had not changed the F.B.I.\u2019s original recommendation to not charge Mrs. Clinton.\nRepublicans most likely would have attacked Mrs. Clinton if she had asked Mr. Comey to resign upon her election, but some people close to her have said that she was willing to endure whatever political cost was necessary in order to ensure Mr. Comey lost his job.\nThe Justice Department\u2019s inspector general is investigating Mr. Comey\u2019s handling of the Clinton email case, including his decision to both discuss it at a news conference and disclose just days before the election that he had new information that could lead him to reopen it.\nThe F.B.I. says it welcomes the investigation, and F.B.I. officials say they believe more information will be made available to the public that will help explain his actions.\nOn Sunday at the White House, Mr. Trump held an event to honor law enforcement officers who provided security for the inauguration. After calling the Secret Service director to the front of the room, Mr. Trump spotted Mr. Comey.\n\u201cOh, there\u2019s Jim; he\u2019s become more famous than me,\u201d Mr. Trump said.", "date": "Jan. 24, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/24/us/politics/trump-comey-fbi-director-.html", "tags": "f.b.i comey clinton investigation director would trump james mrs. said keep"}
