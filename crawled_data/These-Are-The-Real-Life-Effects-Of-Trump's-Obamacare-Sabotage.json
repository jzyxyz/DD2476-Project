{"title": "These Are The Real-Life Effects Of Trump's Obamacare Sabotage", "content": "Somebody has finally put some numbers on what the Republican effort to undermine Obamacare will mean for everyday Americans.\u00a0\nCome 2019, the number of people without health insurance will rise by nearly 5 million, while millions more will enroll in \u201cshort-term\u201d plans, according to Urban Institute\u00a0research released Monday.\u00a0The study is the first serious effort to assess the combined effects of several major health policy changes that President Donald Trump and his allies have made over the past year.\nThose short-term plans will be popular because they are dirt cheap, relative to the usual price of health insurance. But that\u2019s only because they aren\u2019t available to people with pre-existing conditions and leave out key benefits like mental health, maternity care and prescriptions \u2015\u00a0which at least some of those beneficiaries will need when they get sick.\nMeanwhile, some people who need or want more comprehensive coverage will have to pay more for it, as the study predicts premiums for such plans will rise 18 percent. And the federal government, which subsidizes plans for lower-income consumers through tax credits, will have to spend more money.\nThis is still a far cry from full repeal of the Affordable Care Act, which is what Trump and the Republicans tried to pass last year. But it represents a significant reversal of the changes that the 2010 health care law unleashed.\nOne of the most significant recent policy shifts is the decision to end the individual mandate, which imposes a fine on people who could afford to pay for insurance but decline to do so. Trump signed tax legislation in December that ends the mandate starting next year.\nBut that is not the only big change Trump and congressional Republicans are making. Trump is using his executive authority to\u00a0undermine Obamacare\u2019s insurance rules, including those that prohibit insurers from declining coverage to people with\u00a0pre-existing conditions,\u00a0as well as some that require insurers to cover 10 \u201cessential benefits\u201d\u00a0such as mental health, maternity and prescription drugs.\nThe most vivid example of this is a regulation the Trump administration formally proposed last week. It would allow insurers to sell\u00a0\u201cshort-term\u201d or \u201climited duration\u201d plans\u00a0that would last for up to one year. Such plans can deny coverage for pre-existing conditions and don\u2019t have to cover all of the essential benefits, engaging in the sorts of practices that the 2010 health care law sought to prohibit altogether.\nThese plans have existed for a long time. But they could not last for more than three months under regulations the Obama administration put in place \u2015 and they would not count toward the individual mandate.\nThe rule didn\u2019t go into effect until in 2016, and some insurers already flout it by packaging together multiple plans so they last for a year. Still, with the mandate in place, the plans have mostly served a relatively small niche market: those with brief lapses in coverage.\nWith the dissolution of the individual mandate, these changes have potential to shake up the markets for people buying coverage on their own. \nPeople in relatively good health will increasingly sign up for short-term plans, which will be cheaper because they are less widely available and cover fewer services than more regulated Affordable Care Act plans. People with more serious medical needs won\u2019t make the shift, leaving existing plans with a less healthy pool \u2015 forcing insurers to raise premiums for those plans by 18 percent, according to Urban Institute researchers.\nTo be clear, that is 18 percent above and beyond any other premium increases. \nIt\u2019s also an average figure, with considerable variation from state to state, and even within individual states. Under the Affordable Care Act, anybody with household income of less than four times the poverty line \u2015 about $100,000 a year for a family of four \u2015 is eligible for tax credits that discount premiums. As the premiums go up, so do the tax credits, insulating these people from the effects of the increases.\nBut that also means the tax credits will end up putting a greater strain on the federal treasury.\u00a0The cost of tax credits will go up by about 9 percent, according to the study.\nMeanwhile, the number of people without health insurance will go up by several million, according to the Urban study. The actual number depends on how you define insurance.\nOverall, Urban\u2019s researchers predict, the number of uninsured people in 2019 should be 4.7 million higher than it would have been if Republicans had not touched the Affordable Care Act at all. That reflects a number of smaller shifts in coverage \u2015 including a decline in Medicaid enrollment because the mandate encourages people to investigate their insurance options and some inevitably discover they fall within Medicaid\u2019s eligibility guidelines.\nBut even that figure doesn\u2019t fully capture the coverage impact of GOP changes. In particular, it doesn\u2019t include more than 4 million additional people who would be \u201cinsured\u201d but have these short-term plans without the pre-existing condition and essential benefit guarantees, the researchers say.\u00a0\nPutting those two numbers together would mean the number of people without comprehensive coverage \u2015 in other words, the type that meets the Affordable Care Act\u2019s standards \u2015 will rise by nearly 9 million, according to the Urban study.\u00a0\nThat is not to say 9 million people will be unhappy. \nSome people prefer not to buy insurance, and by next year they won\u2019t have to choose between going without coverage and paying a penalty.\u00a0\nMany who buy short-term plans will appreciate the chance to get insurance for much lower monthly premiums. If not for the availability of short-term plans, some of them would not have gotten any insurance at all.\u00a0But those plans also don\u2019t provide the same kind of protection against medical bills, which means that some people who buy the plans will discover \u2015 upon getting sick \u2015 they don\u2019t have coverage they need.\nMeanwhile, those who already have pre-existing conditions generally won\u2019t have access to these policies. Higher premiums will \u201cdisproportionately\u201d hit middle-income Americans who already have health problems, according to the Urban researchers.\u00a0\nLike all projections on the effects of health care policy changes, this latest one is subject to plenty of uncertainty \u2015 in other words, the precise figures aren\u2019t actually that precise. But Urban\u2019s model is widely cited and respected, and few experts would dispute that it is \u201cdirectionally\u201d correct. \nIn other words, most experts would say, the types of changes the researchers expect \u2015 higher premiums for comprehensive coverage, more uninsured, higher federal spending \u2015 are almost certain to happen. It\u2019s just a question of how big the effects are.", "date": "\n02/26/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/these-are-the-real-life-effects-of-trumps-obamacare-sabotage_n_5a9424dfe4b03b55731e5a30", "tags": "care effects coverage obamacare real-life \u201c short-term trump \u2015 plans sabotage insurance health"}
