{"title": "The Southern Charms of Spain and Portugal", "content": "I was at the official end of the world, standing among yellow wildflowers on the edge of a craggy cliff, looking out over the chromatic waters of the Atlantic \u2014 endless ceruleans and captivating cyans in every shade imaginable.\nThe end of the world, that is, before we knew the earth was round: Before Vasco da Gama reached India by sea and before Magellan circumnavigated the globe, the southwesternmost point of what is now Portugal was considered the end of the known world. The Romans supposedly called Cape St. Vincent Promontorium Sacrum (Holy Promontory), believing that the water quenched the sun every evening, as the ball of fire set into the ocean.\nI had arrived here via Seville, in Spain, a superb jumping-off point for exploring Andalusia and, across the border, southern Portugal. Just a few hours in the car can transport you to the beautiful whitewashed buildings of Vejer de la Frontera, or to a sherry bodega, learning the intricacies of winemaking in the so-called Sherry Triangle, with immaculate beaches and stunning cliffside views not far away.\nWith the dollar still relatively strong, there\u2019s no better time to tour this welcoming part of the world and enjoy what it has to offer \u2014 with a little planning, your pocketbook will hardly be worse for wear.\nMy gracious hosts in the small Portuguese town of Carrapateira were a Spanish couple, Ignacio and \u00c1ngela Ybarra, friends of mine who keep a vacation home there. Ignacio explained why they loved vacationing in southern Portugal: It\u2019s beautiful, cheap and still relatively undiscovered. \u201cIt\u2019s like how Spain used to be,\u201d he said.\nCarrapateira, less than a three-hour drive from Seville, is perfectly situated between two excellent beaches: Praia do Amado and Praia da Bordeira. The former is more of a conventional beach, with surfing, food vendors and great people-watching among big crowds.\nBordeira, though, is where you want to be if you\u2019d like a relaxing, meditative beach experience. After taking in the breathtaking cliffside scenery on Estrada da Praia, we forded the Ribeira da Carrapateira to reach the beach (easy enough \u2014 it was only a trickle). Ignacio and I walked the entire length of Bordeira, roughly two miles.\nAfter the first mile or so, we didn\u2019t encounter a single person on the perfect white sand beach, save a couple of campers in a tent pitched near a grotto. The only evidence anyone had been on the beach at all was the odd washed-up fisherman\u2019s buoy, which Ignacio scooped up and put into a plastic bag.\nThe rest of Carrapateira is modest but charming. Nearly all the houses are painted white or off-white, and it offers some decent housing options for tourists (I stopped into the cute Pens\u00e3o das Dunas, with doubles from 25 to 55 euros \u2014 $28 to $62 \u2014 per night, depending on the season) and at least one very good place to eat, Restaurante do Cabrita. Seafood is the specialty, naturally, and while it offers dishes like grilled bass (\u20ac13.80) and fried cuttlefish (\u20ac10.50) for reasonable prices, we were looking for something more out of the ordinary.\nWe found it: The waiter put a steaming platter of some of the strangest seafood I\u2019d ever seen onto the table. They were perceves, or gooseneck barnacles (\u20ac45 per kilo), with black-orange tubular bodies and grayish bulbous, pointed tips. A delicacy in Portugal, the locally harvested creatures resemble an alien life form but taste briny and slightly sweet, with a texture like a chewy scallop.\nOn my way out of Carrapateira I went south and took in the beautiful vistas at the aforementioned end of the world \u2014 the town of Sagres and Cape St. Vincent, with its active lighthouse. Stopping for gas, I grabbed a huge and filling eggplant sandwich (\u20ac4) from aSagres Restaurant and did a little souvenir shopping at Artesanato A M\u00f3 (mugs and cute ceramic refrigerator magnets are \u20ac2.90).\nWith many charming towns and Instagrammable beaches dotting Portugal\u2019s southern coast, it\u2019s tough to go wrong. Stopping through Lagos is a good bet, however. I parked near the harbor on Avenida dos Descobrimentos and did a little window-shopping among the many street vendors hawking towels, jewelry and handbags made from local cork (small purses were in the \u20ac5 to \u20ac10 range). From there I strolled down the narrow lanes of Lagos\u2019s city center, with its red-tiled roofs, and fell in love with one particularly beautiful building near Lu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es Plaza: Bedecked in bright emerald-green tile, the eye-catching structure would not have been out of place in the Emerald City in Oz.\nAfter picking up a quick \u20ac2.50 chorizo sandwich from the fast-food favorite A Merendeira, I drove south for roughly a mile to Ponta da Piedade for more jaw-dropping panoramas of jagged cliffs plunging into limpid blue waters. I hiked around for an hour or two on a few of the surrounding coastal trails, some of which can get a bit precarious \u2014 use caution when taking photos.\nIf you haven\u2019t had enough of the beach (is such a thing possible?), I recommend stopping in Albufeira, roughly an hour\u2019s drive east of Lagos. While the parking situation is a little dicier and the beach slightly coarser, it\u2019s still a pleasant place to dip your toes.\nFarther down the coast, the town of Tavira, which straddles the Gil\u00e3o River, is rich with Old World charm. Near the amphitheater-like main plaza on the Roman Bridge, to which bunches of palm leaves were attached (it was near the end of Holy Week), a man with an accordion sat playing \u201cO Sole Mio\u201d \u2014 just a touch too perfect but difficult to resist while gazing out over the water and feeling the cobblestones under your feet.\nA couple of miles away, I had dinner at Casa do Polvo, the first and only octopus-specialty restaurant I\u2019d ever been to. In whatever form you could possibly want to consume octopus, it\u2019s on the menu: croquettes, pies, skewers, boiled, burgers. I opted for a more classic grilled octopus (\u20ac13.50) \u2014 it was tender and yielding and tasted of onions and herbs.\n\nSouthern Portugal\u2019s appeal, while great, is certainly matched by that of Seville\u2019s surrounding Andalusian towns. And none are more intriguing, perhaps, than Jerez de la Frontera, Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda and El Puerto de Santa Mar\u00eda. The three towns, each no more than a half-hour from the others, comprise what\u2019s known as the Sherry Triangle. The popular fortified wine must be produced within the triangle to be officially considered sherry under Spanish law. (The grapes, however, may be grown outside the triangle.) The city of Jerez (the Spanish word for sherry) is the home of the Gonz\u00e1lez Byass winery and its most famous brand, Tio Pepe.\nVisitors can tour the bodega (\u20ac14 with two wines; \u20ac20 with four wines and tapas), which dates to 1835, learning about the winemaking process and exploring the cool, musty soleras, where the hulking sherry barrels are kept. The different varieties of sherry are fun to learn about (and taste), from the fino variety, which resembles a dry table wine, to the Pedro Xim\u00e9nez variety, which is aged until thick and dark, and tastes like a mouthful of liquid raisins. Tours are available in Spanish, English and German.\nSherry isn\u2019t the only thing to focus on in Jerez \u2014 just 10 minutes away is one of the more singular spectacles I\u2019ve taken in on my travels, a horse-dancing exhibition at the Royal Andalusian School of Equestrian Arts.\nThe school\u2019s highly competitive dressage program, which lasts four years, accepts just a handful of students. The dancing exhibition (\u20ac21 for adults; \u20ac13 for children) is difficult to describe \u2014 this isn\u2019t your typical equestrian event. Rather, it\u2019s a highly stylized, very choreographed set of dance steps, for lack of a better term. The horses gamboled with rhythmic precision in a way I\u2019ve never seen animals move.\nIn the Sherry Triangle, though, one is never far from its namesake wine \u2014 it practically flows through the streets. In Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda, which sits at the mouth of the Guadalquivir River (the same river that runs through Seville), bodegas like La Cigarrera and La Gitana specialize in manzanilla, another variety of sherry.\nOne afternoon, after making the 60-mile drive down from Seville, my friend Claudia Garc\u00eda Aguado and I maneuvered our way through the busy Plaza del Cabildo and nabbed a table at Barbiana, where I had a small glass of the town\u2019s famous manzanilla (for a mere \u20ac1.20). It was powerfully dry and just slightly bitter, a perfect accompaniment to our tapa of papas ali\u00f1\u00e1 con melva, possibly the best thing I ate during my time in Spain. The dish was a small bed of warm potatoes, flavored with onion, parsley, olive oil and chamomile vinegar, on which sat a couple of pieces of flaky mackerel. It was simple, hearty and almost unreasonably inexpensive at \u20ac2.\nAbout an hour south of Jerez lay a town that, while not famous for any particular alcoholic beverage, burned itself into my memory by virtue of its sheer elegance. Vejer de la Frontera, one of Andalusia\u2019s famous pueblos blancos (white towns) sits atop a hill overlooking the Barbate River, and is unquestionably one of the more picturesque places I\u2019ve visited. Nearly all the town\u2019s buildings are whitewashed and take on a chalky bluish color in the late afternoon \u2014 the uniformity creates a delicate simplicity (and provides for some wonderful photo opportunities).\nThere\u2019s even a chance to semi-splurge at a reasonably priced Michelin-recommended restaurant, El Jard\u00edn del Califa. From the town\u2019s main plaza, entering the restaurant\u2019s awe-inspiring 16th-century building felt like descending into a castle dungeon. Once we passed through and made it onto the patio, though, it felt like sitting in a caliphate\u2019s gardens.\nClaudia and I shared a chicken tagine (\u20ac13) and spicy Palmyra salad with eggplant and black garlic (\u20ac8.90). While the food was quite good, it was the environment, and Vejer\u2019s exceptional beauty, that made me feel as if I\u2019d been granted a glimpse of something truly special.", "date": "June 14, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/14/travel/spain-sherry-portugal-triangle-budget-travel.html", "tags": "like world sherry town end de one portugal beach southern charms \u2014 spain"}
