{"title": "Devin Nunes Says He Will Continue to Lead Russia Inquiry", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee rebuffed calls on Tuesday to recuse himself from the panel\u2019s investigation into Russian meddling in the presidential election, as Democrats accused him of stalling the inquiry by canceling the committee\u2019s meetings.\nRepresentative Devin Nunes of California, the chairman, said he would continue to lead the House investigation despite accusations from Democrats \u2014 including his committee\u2019s ranking member, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California \u2014 that he is too close to President Trump to conduct an impartial inquiry.\n\u201cWhy would I not?\u201d Mr. Nunes told reporters on Tuesday morning. Pressed about concerns from Democrats, he added, \u201cThat sounds like their problem.\u201d\nThe announcement that the committee would not hold a closed-door meeting on Tuesday as expected with James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director; and Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency \u2014 a briefing Mr. Nunes insisted needed to happen before the committee could move forward with its public hearings \u2014 startled some Democrats. They added that the cancellations went further, including a regular meeting later in the week.\nRepresentative Jim Himes of Connecticut, a Democrat on the committee, called it \u201cprofoundly concerning.\u201d\n\u201cEffectively, what has happened is the committee\u2019s oversight, the oversight of our national intelligence apparatus, has come to a halt because of this particular issue,\u201d he said.\nMr. Nunes disputed that the investigation had stalled, though he noted that it was difficult for the committee \u201cto move forward with interviews and depositions\u201d until members could speak to Mr. Comey again.\n\u201cNothing has been canceled,\u201d Mr. Nunes said. \u201cEverything is moving forward as is.\u201d\nHe also said the committee had invited Mr. Comey to appear once more, though it was unclear when that might happen. A committee spokesman said the request had been extended to Admiral Rogers as well. Mr. Schiff did not sign the letter, two aides said.\nSpeaker Paul D. Ryan maintained on Tuesday to reporters that he saw no reason for Mr. Nunes to step away from the investigation.\nLast week, Mr. Nunes said he briefed Mr. Ryan on information indicating Mr. Trump or members of his transition team might have been \u201cincidentally\u201d caught up in legal surveillance of foreign operatives by American spy agencies. Mr. Ryan said on Tuesday that he did not know the source of that information.\nIn a new flare-up on Tuesday, The Washington Post reported that the White House had tried to block Sally Q. Yates, who was fired by Mr. Trump as acting attorney general in January, from appearing before the committee, apparently arguing that much of her testimony could be banned from discussion by presidential privilege that shields certain sensitive information from the public.\nIn letters later obtained by The New York Times, her lawyer pushed back, asserting that much of what Ms. Yates would address had already been described publicly by senior administration officials. The letters were dated late last week, around the time Mr. Nunes abruptly announced his decision to scrap a public hearing.\nSean Spicer, the White House press secretary, rejected the report as \u201c100 percent false,\u201d saying the White House would not bar Ms. Yates from testifying. He also rejected the idea that the White House had pressured Mr. Nunes to cancel the hearing.\n\u201cI hope she testifies,\u201d he said. \u201cI look forward to it.\u201d\nMr. Schiff said he was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d by the cancellation of the hearing with Ms. Yates and other former officials, which he said would have focused at least in part on Michael T. Flynn, the national security adviser who resigned after it was revealed that he lied to White House officials, including Vice President Mike Pence, about his contacts with Russia.\nIt was the latest development in a week in which bipartisan cooperation quickly collapsed. Last week, without consulting Mr. Schiff, Mr. Nunes bumped a planned public hearing with James R. Clapper Jr., the former director of national intelligence; John O. Brennan, the former C.I.A. director; and Ms. Yates, who was fired after she instructed Justice Department officials to not carry out Mr. Trump\u2019s first proposed travel ban.\nTensions had escalated on Monday after the confirmation that Mr. Nunes had traveled to the White House grounds last week to view what he described as classified intelligence documents. A day after that, he announced to the news media, and then to Mr. Trump, that he had seen information indicating that members of the Trump transition team may have been caught up in legal surveillance.\n\u201cNone of us, Democrat or Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, still has any idea what he\u2019s talking about,\u201d said Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the Democratic vice chairman of the committee.\nMr. Schiff and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the top House Democrat, led calls for Mr. Nunes to recuse himself, arguing that he had proved himself incapable of leading an impartial investigation.\nRepresentative Walter B. Jones, a North Carolina Republican who has joined Democrats in calling for more scrutiny of Russian meddling in the election, also called on Tuesday for Mr. Nunes to step away from the investigation. Mr. Nunes was a member of the Trump transition team, as well as a vocal supporter of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.", "date": "March 28, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/28/us/politics/devin-nunes-house-intelligence-committee-russia.html", "tags": "continue devin inquiry investigation committee \u201d house lead says nunes russia tuesday"}
