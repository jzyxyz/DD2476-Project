{"title": "Swedish election: Main blocs neck and neck as nationalists gain", "content": "The Swedish general election has left the two main political blocs almost tied, with the anti-immigration party making gains on its previous results.\nWith nearly all ballots counted, the governing centre-left coalition is marginally ahead of its centre-right Alliance rivals, with around 40% each.\nThe nationalist Sweden Democrats (SD) have won about  18% of the vote, up from 12.9% in the previous election.\nA protracted battle to form a working coalition now looks certain.\nBoth of the main blocs have refused to govern with the SD, although its leader said he was prepared to talk with all other parties.\n\"We will increase our seats in parliament and we will gain huge influence over what happens in Sweden during the coming weeks, months and years,\" Jimmie Akesson told a party rally. \nHe had hoped to gain the support of one in five, or even one in four, Swedes, which some polls had also predicted. However, the results were closer to one in six. \nOther European countries have seen support rise for anti-immigration parties in recent years. Earlier this year, Italy installed a new coalition government run by the anti-establishment Five Star and the right-wing League. In 2017  the far-right Alternative for Germany won 12.6% of votes, and The Danish People's Party won 21% in 2015.\nSweden has become accustomed to coalition governments and no one was expecting an outright winning party in this election.  \nThe current coalition, headed by outgoing PM Stefan Lofven, is made up of his Social Democrats and the Green Party, and is supported in parliament by the Left Party.\nOn the other side, the centre-right Alliance is made up of four parties: the Moderates, the Centre, the Liberals and the Christian Democrats. It was formed in 2004 to counter decades of dominance by the Social Democrats. \nThe main party in the Alliance is the centre-right Moderates and they have proposed Ulf Kristersson as their candidate for PM.\nSweden uses a system of proportional representation, under which each party is allocated a number of seats in each constituency that is broadly in line with its share of the vote.\nNeither of the leading alliances has reached the threshold of 175 seats, which is needed to govern. \nMr Lofven's bloc holds 144 seats and the Alliance holds one less.\nOverseas votes, which could make a slight change to the outcome, have not yet been counted and the final result is not expected until Wednesday.   \nLengthy negotiations will follow to attempt to form a workable government. One option could be for one of the parties to switch alliances. \nAt a party rally on Sunday night, Mr Lofven refused to quit. \"We have two weeks left until parliament opens. I will work on calmly, as prime minister, respecting voters and the Swedish electoral system,\" he said.\nBy Gavin Lee, BBC News in Stockholm\nThe headline in a Swedish National newspaper says it all, D\u00f6tt Lopp, which means Dead Heat. \nThe governing Social Democrat party is the largest party, but because the centre left doesn't have a collective majority, it can't govern together in a coalition. \nThe opposition Moderate party is also unable to take over because even an established alliance with the centre-right parties doesn't make up the numbers needed for a majority. \nHence the leader of the nationalist Sweden Democrats, Jimmy Akesson's claim, that he is the \"kingmaker\" being the third most popular party - but that's a simplified view. No other party will consider the anti-migrant hard-right group in any form of coalition. \nThe Sweden Democrats could however play a role as possible home-wrecker for the Prime Minister Stefan Lofven. In roughly two weeks, Mr Lofven faces a confidence vote in parliament. \nIf he is forced to stand down, parliament would be dissolved and fresh coalition attempts would start in September.  \nMr Akesson says Mr Lofven's party must enter into a dialogue with him, otherwise he will support a no confidence vote alongside the main opposition alliance and Mr Lofven would certainly go. \nThe prime minister must choose between: risking losing core voters by dealing with the party he calls racist; and bargaining, for the sake of his career.\nThe SD was linked for years to neo-Nazis and other far-right groups, only entering parliament in 2010.\nIt has been working to rebrand itself, changing its logo from a flaming torch (similar to the one used by the UK far-right National Front) to a blue-and-yellow daisy, the colours of the Swedish flag. \nTraditionally appealing to working-class men, it wants to attract more women and higher-income voters.\nMr Akesson says there is zero tolerance towards racism in the party and several members have been expelled.\nHowever, the party has still been embroiled in various racism scandals. \nOne municipal candidate shared a song on Facebook with the lyrics \"Swedes are white and the country is ours\", according to a report in tabloid Aftonbladet.\nSweden's economy is booming but many voters are concerned that housing, healthcare and welfare services have come under pressure from a wave of immigration during the 2015 migrant crisis. \nThat year Sweden took in a record 163,000 asylum seekers - the highest such intake in the EU, per head of population.\nSweden's traditional parties have since hardened their tone to reflect concerns about integration.\nMany voters are also concerned about violence. The SD links a rise in shootings to increased immigration, although official figures show no correlation. \nThe SD also wants to leave the European Union and has proposed a \"Swexit\" referendum. However, the centrist parties all oppose such a vote, so it is unlikely to go ahead. \nAside from immigration, climate change is an issue many Swedes care about - particularly after a long, hot summer and severe forest fires. \nDuring the heatwave, around 25,000 hectares of forest burned in wildfires. Support for the Green party, which had been struggling after various internal scandals, has crept up across the country.\nHave you voted in the Swedish election?
