{"title": "Raucous Town Hall In Utah Blasts GOP Rep- Chaffetz Over Trump", "content": "Hundreds of jeering, shouting, angry voters, jam-packed in a high school auditorium, lashed GOP Rep. Jason Chaffetz at his town hall meeting in the heart of red-state Utah.\nChaffetz was frequently drowned out by boos at Brighton High School, in a Salt Lake City suburb, over the course of Thursday night\u2019s meeting, which he cut short. He was booed when he walked on stage, and he was often booed when he mentioned the name \u201cTrump.\u201d\nThe House Oversight Committee chairman was challenged on Donald Trump\u2019s threat to eliminate Obamacare, his vow to slash support for women\u2019s health by cutting Planned Parenthood funds, a push to sell public lands and the confirmation of Betsy DeVos as education secretary. At one point, Chaffetz promised the voters that they would be \u201chappy with the bill to abolish the Department of Education.\u201d The crowd was not amused.\nThousands of others who were not allowed in the auditorium because of police concerns about crowd control remained outside brandishing protest signs and chanting, \u201cChaffetz is a coward!\u201d\u00a0KUTV Channel 2 reported, and \u201cDo your job!\u201d and \u201cYour last term!\u201d\nOne young girl asked Chaffetz what he was was going to do to protect the environment. \u201cDo you believe in science?\u00a0Because I do,\u201d she said to loud cheers.\n\u201cI don\u2019t pretend to have all the answers,\u201d he responded. \u201cI do support an \u2018all of the above\u2019 energy strategy, and I do think coal is an important part of that,\u201d he said to resounding boos.\n\u201cWhere do you draw a line in the sand?\u201d asked one woman in the audience regarding Trump\u2019s potential conflicts of interest.\n\u201cEveryone has to comply with the law,\u201d Chaffetz responded.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re really not going to like this part,\u201d again to boos. \u201cThe president, under the law, is exempt from the conflict-of-interest laws.\u201d\nThe intensity of the furious reception for Chaffetz was a surprise, a clear sign that those gathered were angry about Trump\u2019s policies and possibly a very early indication of an uphill battle for incumbents in the midterm elections.\nA resolutely smiling Chaffetz remained steadfastly positive and friendly even as the meeting grew uglier\u00a0\u2014 though he scolded one audience member for swearing and told the crowd at one point, \u201cRelax, relax.\u201d He said mid-meeting that it was so loud it was \u201clike the \u2018Price Is Right\u2019 here.\u201d\nAs Chaffetz wrapped up the town hall, he was met with a crescendo of boos. He refused to take questions from reporters. The Salt Lake Tribune in the heavily Mormon city said the meeting was \u201cstacked\u201d with \u201cliberal resistance\u201d groups. Utah went for Trump in the presidential election, 45 percent to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 27 percent (with 21 percent going to Mormon independent Evan McMullen), but Salt Lake County and neighboring Summit County voted for Clinton.\nChaffetz was a key player in the investigations over the Benghazi attacks and a private email server that plagued Clinton during the presidential campaign. Now he\u2019s under pressure to bring the same scrutiny to Trump.\nHe conceded Thursday that Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway\u2019s plug on national TV to buy Ivanka Trump\u2019s products was \u201cunacceptable\u201d and \u201cclearly over the line.\u201d He said that he and the leading Democrat on the committee, Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), would jointly refer Conway\u00a0to the Office of Government Ethics for an investigation.\n\u201cIt should have never happened, and they better learn this lesson very quick,\u201d\u00a0Chaffetz told NBC.\nThis article previously quoted Chaffetz as saying \u201cthere are good people on both sides of the aisle\u201d in response to a question from a 9-year-old girl at the town hall. His quote was, rather, \u201cwe need good people on both sides of the aisle,\u201d and was in the context of praising her for speaking up. The quote has been updated with his more direct response to her question.", "date": "\n02/10/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/raucous-utah-town-hall-blasts-gop-representative-chaffetz_n_589d2d80e4b094a129e9ac7c", "tags": "raucous town chaffetz gop \u201d trump one meeting utah rep- hall boos blasts"}
