{"title": "Trump Discussed Pulling U.S. From NATO, Aides Say Amid New Concerns Over Russia", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 There are few things that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia desires more than the weakening of NATO, the military alliance among the United States, Europe and Canada that has deterred Soviet and Russian aggression for 70 years.\nLast year, President Trump suggested a move tantamount to destroying NATO: the withdrawal of the United States.\nSenior administration officials told The New York Times that several times over the course of 2018, Mr. Trump privately said he wanted to withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Current and former officials who support the alliance said they feared Mr. Trump could return to his threat as allied military spending continued to lag behind the goals the president had set.\nIn the days around a tumultuous NATO summit meeting last summer, they said, Mr. Trump told his top national security officials that he did not see the point of the military alliance, which he presented as a drain on the United States.\nAt the time, Mr. Trump\u2019s national security team, including Jim Mattis, then the defense secretary, and John R. Bolton, the national security adviser, scrambled to keep American strategy on track without mention of a withdrawal that would drastically reduce Washington\u2019s influence in Europe and could embolden Russia for decades.\nNow, the president\u2019s repeatedly stated desire to withdraw from NATO is raising new worries among national security officials amid growing concern about Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to keep his meetings with Mr. Putin secret from even his own aides, and an F.B.I. investigation into the administration\u2019s Russia ties.\nA move to withdraw from the alliance, in place since 1949, \u201cwould be one of the most damaging things that any president could do to U.S. interests,\u201d said Mich\u00e8le A. Flournoy, an under secretary of defense under President Barack Obama.\n\u201cIt would destroy 70-plus years of painstaking work across multiple administrations, Republican and Democratic, to create perhaps the most powerful and advantageous alliance in history,\u201d Ms. Flournoy said in an interview. \u201cAnd it would be the wildest success that Vladimir Putin could dream of.\u201d\nRetired Adm. James G. Stavridis, the former supreme allied commander of NATO, said an American withdrawal from the alliance would be \u201ca geopolitical mistake of epic proportion.\u201d\n\u201cEven discussing the idea of leaving NATO \u2014 let alone actually doing so \u2014 would be the gift of the century for Putin,\u201d Admiral Stavridis said.\nSenior Trump administration officials discussed the internal and highly sensitive efforts to preserve the military alliance on condition of anonymity.\nAfter the White House was asked for comment on Monday, a senior administration official pointed to Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks in July when he called the United States\u2019 commitment to NATO \u201cvery strong\u201d and the alliance \u201cvery important.\u201d The official declined to comment further.\nAmerican national security officials believe that Russia has largely focused on undermining solidarity between the United States and Europe after it annexed Crimea in 2014. Its goal was to upend NATO, which Moscow views as a threat.\nRussia\u2019s meddling in American elections and its efforts to prevent former satellite states from joining the alliance have aimed to weaken what it views as an enemy next door, the American officials said. With a weakened NATO, they said, Mr. Putin would have more freedom to behave as he wishes, setting up Russia as a counterweight to Europe and the United States.\nAn American withdrawal from the alliance would accomplish all that Mr. Putin has been trying to put into motion, the officials said \u2014 essentially, doing the Russian leader\u2019s hardest and most critical work for him.\nWhen Mr. Trump first raised the possibility of leaving the alliance, senior administration officials were unsure if he was serious. He has returned to the idea several times, officials said increasing their worries.\nMr. Trump\u2019s dislike of alliances abroad and American commitments to international organizations is no secret.\nThe president has repeatedly and publicly challenged or withdrawn from a number of military and economic partnerships, from the Paris climate accord to an Asia-Pacific trade pact. He has questioned the United States\u2019 military alliance with South Korea and Japan, and he has announced a withdrawal of American troops from Syria without first consulting allies in the American-led coalition to defeat the Islamic State.\nNATO had planned to hold a leaders meeting in Washington to mark its 70th anniversary in April, akin to the 50-year celebration that was hosted by President Bill Clinton in 1999. But this year\u2019s meeting has been downgraded to a foreign ministers gathering, as some diplomats feared that Mr. Trump could use a Washington summit meeting to renew his attacks on the alliance.\nLeaders are now scheduled to meet at the end of 2019, but not in Washington.\nMr. Trump\u2019s threats to withdraw had sent officials scrambling to prevent the annual gathering of NATO leaders in Brussels last July from turning into a disaster.\nSenior national security officials had already pushed the military alliance\u2019s ambassadors to complete a formal agreement on several NATO goals \u2014 including shared defenses against Russia \u2014 before the summit meeting even began, to shield it from Mr. Trump.\nBut Mr. Trump upended the proceedings anyway. One meeting, on July 12, was ostensibly supposed to be about Ukraine and Georgia \u2014 two non-NATO members with aspirations to join the alliance.\nAccepted protocol dictates that alliance members do not discuss internal business in front of nonmembers. But as is frequently the case, Mr. Trump did not adhere to the established norms, according to several American and European officials who were in the room.\nHe complained that European governments were not spending enough on the shared costs of defense, leaving the United States to carry an outsize burden. He expressed frustration that European leaders would not, on the spot, pledge to spend more. And he appeared not to grasp the details when several tried to explain to him that spending levels were set by parliaments in individual countries, the American and European officials said.\nThen, at another leaders gathering at the same summit meeting, Mr. Trump appeared to be taken by surprise by Jens Stoltenberg, the NATO secretary general.\nBacking Mr. Trump\u2019s position, Mr. Stoltenberg pushed allies to increase their spending and praised the United States for leading by example \u2014 including by increasing its military spending in Europe. At that, according to one official who was in the room, Mr. Trump whipped his head around and glared at American officials behind him, surprised by Mr. Stoltenberg\u2019s remarks and betraying ignorance of his administration\u2019s own spending plans.\nMr. Trump appeared especially annoyed, officials in the meeting said, with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and her country\u2019s military spending of 1 percent of its gross domestic product.\nBy comparison, the United States\u2019 military spending is about 4 percent of G.D.P., and Mr. Trump has railed against allies for not meeting the NATO spending goal of 2 percent of economic output. At the summit meeting, he surprised the leaders by demanding 4 percent \u2014 a move that would essentially put the goal out of reach for many alliance members. He also threatened that the United States would \u201cgo its own way\u201d in 2019 if military spending from other NATO countries did not rise.\nDuring the middle of a speech by Ms. Merkel, Mr. Trump again broke protocol by getting up and leaving, sending ripples of shock across the room, according to American and European officials who were there. But before he left, the president walked behind Ms. Merkel and interrupted her speech to call her a great leader. Startled and relieved that Mr. Trump had not continued his berating of the leaders, the people in the room clapped.\nIn the end, the NATO leaders publicly papered over their differences to present a unified front. But both European leaders and American officials emerged from the two days in Brussels shaken and worried that Mr. Trump would renew his threat to withdraw from the alliance.\nMr. Trump\u2019s skepticism of NATO appears to be a core belief, administration officials said, akin to his desire to expropriate Iraq\u2019s oil. While officials have explained multiple times why the United States cannot take Iraq\u2019s oil, Mr. Trump returns to the issue every few months.\nSimilarly, just when officials think the issue of NATO membership has been settled, Mr. Trump again brings up his desire to leave the alliance.\nAny move by Mr. Trump against NATO would most likely invite a response by Congress. American policy toward Russia is the one area where congressional Republicans have consistently bucked Mr. Trump, including with new sanctions on Moscow and by criticizing his warm July 16 news conference with Mr. Putin in Helsinki, Finland.\nMembers of NATO may withdraw after a notification period of a year, under Article 13 of the Washington Treaty. Such a delay would give Congress time to try blocking any attempt by Mr. Trump to leave.\n\u201cIt\u2019s alarming that the president continues to falsely assert that NATO does not contribute to the overall safety of the United States or the international community,\u201d said Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat who is among the lawmakers who support legislation to stop Mr. Trump from withdrawing from the military alliance. \u201cThe Senate knows better and stands ready to defend NATO.\u201d\nNATO\u2019s popularity with the public continues to be strong. But the alliance has become a more partisan issue, with Democrats showing strong enthusiasm and Republican support softening, according to a survey by the Ronald Reagan Institute.\nKay Bailey Hutchison, Washington\u2019s ambassador to NATO and a former Republican senator, has sought to build support for the alliance in Congress, including helping to organize a bipartisan group of backers.\nBut even if Congress moved to block a withdrawal, a statement by Mr. Trump that he wanted to leave would greatly damage NATO. Allies feeling threatened by Russia already have extreme doubts about whether Mr. Trump would order troops to come to their aid.\nIn his resignation letter last month, Mr. Mattis specifically cited his own commitment to America\u2019s alliances in an implicit criticism of Mr. Trump\u2019s principles. Mr. Mattis originally said he would stay through the next NATO meeting at the end of February, but Mr. Trump pushed him out before the new year.\nActing Defense Secretary Patrick M. Shanahan is believed to support the alliance. But he has also pointedly said he thinks that the Pentagon should not be \u201cthe Department of No\u201d to the president.\nEuropean and American officials said the presence of Mr. Mattis, a former top NATO commander, had reassured allies that a senior Trump administration official had their back. His exit from the Pentagon has increased worries among some European diplomats that the safety blanket has now been lost.", "date": "Jan. 14, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/us/politics/nato-president-trump.html", "tags": "pulling aides american officials concerns u.s. nato alliance would states trump united say russia new amid discussed"}
