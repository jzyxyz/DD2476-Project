{"title": "13 Times Apparent Trump Supporters Attacked, Harassed Or Plotted To Kill Muslims", "content": "In a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview\u00a0earlier this month, Donald Trump claimed he wasn\u2019t aware of the wave of hate that had followed on the heels of his presidential election victory.\n\u201cI\u2019m so saddened to hear that,\u201d he told CBS\u2019s Lesley Stahl.\u00a0\u201cAnd I say, \u2018Stop it.\u2019 If it \u2015 if it helps, I will say this, and I will say right to the cameras: \u2018Stop it.\u2019\u201d\nAt least one apparent Trump supporter didn\u2019t heed the president-elect\u2019s advice.\nOn Thursday, a Moroccan Uber driver in Queens, New York, filmed a man in a white SUV harass him and call him a \u201cterrorist\u201d in a profanity-laced tirade.\nNote: This article and the footage below contain explicit language that may not be appropriate for all readers.\n\u201cTrump is president, asshole, so you can kiss your fuckin\u2019 visa goodbye, scumbag,\u201d the man in the SUV yells. \u201cWe\u2019ll deport you soon, don\u2019t worry, you fuckin\u2019 terrorist.\u201d\nThe Uber driver, identified only as Mohammad in press reports, later showed the video to a passenger named Chris Cody. Cody told The Washington Post the driver was \u201cshocked,\u201d \u201cupset\u201d and \u201cintimidated\u201d by the incident.\u00a0\nHe\u2019s not alone in feeling that way.\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center has tracked some 700 acts of this kind of bias intimidation and harassment targeting Muslims, blacks, Latinos, immigrants, and LGBTQ people since Election Day, though the organization cautions it hasn\u2019t independently verified every incident. Many of these attacks and acts of vandalism or harassment were done in Trump\u2019s name, according to the SPLC.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s why, for many American Muslims or people simply perceived to be Muslim, the president-elect\u2019s plea for his supporters to \u201cstop it\u201d might feel more than a little disingenuous.\u00a0\nAfter all, it was Trump that called for the creation of a national database of Muslims, the\u00a0surveillance of mosques\u00a0and the profiling of Muslims.\u00a0He\u2019s often told an apocryphal story about shooting Muslims with bullets dipped in pig\u2019s blood, and once suggested that the Muslim mother of a fallen American soldier wasn\u2019t allowed to talk. He even once declared,\u00a0\u201cIslam hates us.\u201d\nAnd there\u2019s growing evidence that this kind of political speech can have real and dangerous consequences \u2015 that it can embolden people\u2019s hate and radicalize them.\u00a0\nIn the days directly following\u00a0Trump\u2019s proposal to ban Muslims\u00a0from entering the U.S., there was an 87.5 percent increase in hate crimes against Muslims, according to The Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino.\u00a0\nSimilarly, 2015 saw a 67 percent increase in the number of hate crimes targeting Muslims, rising to a rate not seen in the U.S. since 2001.\u00a0\nBut perhaps most telling are incidents like the one last Thursday in Queens, when apparent Trump supporters have either attacked, harassed, terrorized or plotted to kill their Muslim neighbors.\nHere are some more examples:\nThree men belonging to a militia group called the \u201cCrusaders\u201d were arrested in October for plotting to kill Muslim immigrants in Kansas. The trio allegedly stockpiled guns, ammunition and explosive materials, and discussed parking four explosive-filled vehicles outside an apartment complex largely inhabited by Somali immigrants.\nOne of the men, Patrick Stein, allegedly said \u201cthe only good Muslim is a dead Muslim\u201d and that he would \u201cenjoy\u201d shooting Muslims\u2019 heads.\n\u201cWhen we go on operations, there\u2019s no leaving anyone behind, even if it\u2019s a one-year-old, I\u2019m serious. I guarantee, if I go on a mission, those little fuckers are going bye-bye,\u201d Stein said, according to the FBI.\nStein also referred to Somali immigrants as\u00a0\u201ccockroaches,\u201d the FBI said,\u00a0\u201cyelled at Somali women dressed in traditional garb, calling them \u2018fucking raghead bitches\u2019\u201d and talked about using bullets dipped in pig\u2019s blood. (Wonder where he heard that?)\u00a0\nA look at Stein\u2019s Facebook page shows multiple anti-Muslim memes, as well as multiple posts expressing support for Trump. One of the other men arrested, Curtis Allen, also expressed support for Trump online.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m going to kill you all!\u201d 55-year-old William Celli allegedly yelled outside the Islamic Society of West Contra Costa County in California.\nPolice searched Celli\u2019s home after\u00a0receiving a tip that he was building explosives. There, they found a suspicious device and detonated it. Celli was arrested.\nIn the months leading up to his arrest, Celli wrote on Facebook that Trump was a \u201cgreat point man\u201d whom he would \u201cfollow to the end of the world.\u201d In another post about Muslim immigrants, he wrote \u201cKiss your Christian asses goodbye.\u201d\u00a0\nJoseph Michael Schreiber was arrested for allegedly lighting\u00a0the Islamic Center of Fort Pierce\u00a0in Florida on fire.\nOn his Facebook page, among multiple links to anti-Muslim propaganda, Schreiber wrote that all forms of Islam are \u201cradical,\u201d and added that \u201c[Muslims] should be considered TERRORIST AND CRIMANALS and all hoo participate in such activity should be found guilty of WAR CRIM until law and order is restored in this beautiful free country.\u201d\nHis Facebook page also features multiple posts supporting Trump.\u00a0\nJohn Martin Roos, a fanatical Trump supporter from Oregon, was arrested for repeatedly threatening to kill President Barack Obama and federal agents. \u201cObama is nothing less than than a vile muslim trash,\u201d he wrote in one Facebook post.\nRoos loves Trump, however. \u201cAll hail Donald Trump, the savior of America,\u201d he wrote on Christmas Eve. \u201cI\u2019ll bet he was born on Dec 25 just like Jesus.\u201d\nA search of Roos\u2019\u00a0home uncovered four pipe bombs, an AK-47-like firearm, a rifle and shotgun, a .45 caliber Glock and hundreds of rounds of ammunition. \u201cI\u2019m a Patriot willing to die for my right of free speech, lets make a news story for Christmas maybe it will be enough to incite Patriots to whole sale cleanse our country of the muslim disease in America,\u201d he wrote in another Facebook post.\n\u201cGood muslim = dead muslim,\u201d Roos wrote in another.\u00a0\nYemaj Adem says he was driving his cab late one night in Grand Rapids, Michigan, when he picked up Jacob Holtzlander. Near the end of the ride,\u00a0Holtzlander allegedly started to punch Adem and yell \u201cTrump, Trump, Trump!\u201d Police later arrested Holtzlander, who can be heard in a police video yelling racial slurs while seated in the patrol car.\u00a0\nAdem \u2015 who told HuffPost that he is a Muslim \u2015 suffered a bruise on his head and a cut to his hear.\n\u201cI understand there\u2019s a few people that have been brainwashed with hate speech,\u201d Adem told mlive.com. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not labeling everyone like this guy, but there are some out there.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cGet the fuck out of here,\u201d 32-year-old Emirjeta Xhelili allegedly yelled at two Muslim women who were pushing their babies in strollers. \u201cGet the fuck out of America, bitches \u2026 This is America \u2014 you shouldn\u2019t be different from us.\u201d\nXhelili allegedly punched the two women in their faces and tried to rip the hijabs off their heads. At one point, prosecutors alleged she even pushed over one of the women\u2019s baby strollers, with the baby inside.\n\u201cAmerica is the ark of Noah,\u201d reads one of Xhelili\u2019s pro-Trump Facebook posts. \u201cTrump\u2019s gonna win.\u201d\nSurveillance footage outside a Starbucks shows an unidentified woman approaching a Muslim woman wearing a hijab. According to a police report, the suspect started to \u201cverbally abuse her due to her religion\u201d and then \u201cthrew an unknown liquid-like substance\u201d on the woman.\nThe suspect said she was voting for Trump because he said \u201che would send \u2018all of you terrorist Muslims out of this country,\u201d the victim told the Council on American-Islamic Relations.\n\u201cThis just happened right in front of my eyes,\u201d Candy Isabel-Valenzuela wrote in a Facebook post about seeing a man harass a group of Muslims in Grand Rapids, Michigan. \u201cKill Muslims! Kill them all! Kill them all! Kill you all. Kill the Muslims,\u201d the man can be heard screaming. He also yells \u201cTrump! Trump!\u201d\u00a0\nAccording to Valenzeula,\u00a0\u201cafter the video he actually walked by them, tried to swing, missed and fell! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 #racismstillexist.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWhen Donald Trump becomes president, you\u2019re going to have to close down your museum because there\u2019s not going to be any Somalis left in the state,\u201d a man said in this minute-and-a-half voicemail left at the Somali American Museum in Minneapolis, Minnesota in August 2016.\nA copy of the voicemail, which can be heard below, was provided to The Huffington Post.\u00a0\n\u201cBrown trash.\u201d That\u2019s what an unidentified white man called Khondoker Usama and his Hispanic friend at a Kansas gas station. Usama, a 23-year-old Muslim student at Wichita State University, said the man also nonsensically yelled,\u00a0\u201cYou want to live in this country, you better leave.\u201d \nSurveillance footage shows the man attacking Usama and his friend,\u00a0repeatedly punching and pushing them. Eventually, the man flees on a motorcycle. According to Usama, the man started yelling, \u201cTrump! Trump! Trump!\u201d and added,\u00a0\u201cTrump will take our country from you guys!\u201d\nIn Iowa, a vandal wrote \u201cTRUMP\u201d on the side of the Masjid Al-Noor Islamic Center in Waterloo, Iowa.\u00a0\nIn Bayonne, New Jersey, police say suspect Jonathon Hussey wrote \u201cFuck Muslims,\u201d \u201cFuck ISIS,\u201d \u201cFuck Allah\u201d and \u201cFuck Arabs,\u201d as well as \u201cDonald Trump,\u201d on the exterior wall of the Muslim\u00a0Community Miraj Center.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, even as he claims to be \u201csaddened\u201d by the recent wave of Islamophobia and bigotry, Trump is putting together a cabinet filled with people sympathetic to anti-Muslim conspiracy theorists and hate groups.\u00a0A photo of Kris Kobach, Trump\u2019s potential pick for Homeland Security secretary, showed that reinstating a Muslim registry\u00a0was literally at the top of his agenda.\u00a0\nYour Muslim neighbors, and your neighbors who are perceived to be Muslim, need you now more than ever.\u00a0\nThe Huffington Post is documenting the rising wave of anti-Muslim bigotry and violence in America. Take a stand against hate.\u00a0\nHave you been a victim of an act of harassment or discrimination?
