{"title": "E.U. Gives Hungary a Month to Adopt Its Democratic Norms", "content": "BUDAPEST \u2014 The European Commission said Wednesday that Hungary had one month to get in line with the European Union\u2019s norms on freedoms and democratic rights or else face legal action and a delay in the start of talks on a badly needed package of financial aid.\nThe effort was the latest by the commission, the E.U. executive body, aimed at preventing a backward slide of Hungarian democracy under the government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban.\nBrussels first raised concerns in January over whether legislation linked to the new Hungarian Constitution threatened the independence of the judiciary, the central bank and the government\u2019s data protection authority. On Wednesday, the commission demanded that further steps be taken to bring Hungarian law into line with E.U. regulations.\n\u201cI would like to see real changes to the legislation in question to alleviate the commission\u2019s legal concerns,\u201d Viviane Reding, the E.U. justice commissioner, said in a statement.\nThe disputed issues include the anticipated compulsory retirement of 274 judges and public prosecutors, she said.\nIn Budapest, the government said it had approved amendments to draft legislation concerning the central bank and pledged \u201cfurther consulting\u201d with the commission on issues in dispute.\nSince the Constitution came into effect on Jan. 1, Hungary has become a center of concern in Europe over deterioration of democratic principles under Mr. Orban. Martin Brusis, a political scientist at Munich University, said, \u201cThe government has taken some steps to comply with the European Union, but they are largely facade measures that are aimed at covering up the attempts to reduce the system of checks and balances that were in the old Constitution.\u201d\nMr. Orban is seeking unspecified financial assistance from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund to help rebuild investor confidence lost over two years as he applied his unorthodox economic policies, including Europe\u2019s biggest bank tax and a renationalization of private pension fund assets. Budapest is also being pressed by the commission to bring its deficit to a target of 2.5 percent of gross domestic product or face the freezing of \u20ac495 million, or $650 million, in E.U. Cohesion Fund money.\n\u201cThe government absolutely needs positive feedback from the markets, and they will only get this if they show willingness to cooperate with the European Union,\u201d said Julia Lakatos of the Center for Fair Political Analysis in Budapest.\nMelissa Eddy reported from Berlin.
