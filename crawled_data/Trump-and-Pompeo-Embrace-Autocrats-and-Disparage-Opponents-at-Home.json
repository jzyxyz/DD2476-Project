{"title": "Trump and Pompeo Embrace Autocrats and Disparage Opponents at Home", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump has long claimed that he puts \u201cAmerica first\u201d overseas. But in two remarkable statements on Thursday, Mr. Trump and his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, explicitly favored foreign autocrats over elected American leaders.\nMr. Pompeo chose Cairo, the site of President Barack Obama\u2019s 2009 address to the Islamic world, to deliver a caustic, point-by-point repudiation of Mr. Obama\u2019s message. He paid tribute to Egypt\u2019s repressive president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, for his courage in supporting Mr. Trump\u2019s alternative approach.\nAbout an hour later, on the South Lawn of the White House, Mr. Trump said that China\u2019s Communist Party bosses negotiated in better faith than the Democratic leaders in Congress, with whom the president is in a bitter standoff over his border wall that has shut down much of the federal government.\n\u201cI find China, frankly, in many ways to be far more honorable than Cryin\u2019 Chuck and Nancy. I really do,\u201d Mr. Trump said, referring to the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi. \u201cChina is actually much easier to deal with than the opposition party.\u201d\nThis is the same China that Mr. Trump\u2019s national security strategy designated as one of the greatest threats to American interests \u2014 a revisionist power determined to \u201cerode American security and prosperity\u201d with predatory trade practices, military aggression, and a regime that represses its people while trying to undermine America\u2019s democracy.\nMr. Trump\u2019s affinity for strongmen is well established, as is his contempt for his predecessor and his habit of gleefully ridiculing opponents, regardless of their party affiliation. But rarely has the Trump administration offered such a striking display of embracing autocrats as friends and painting those at home with whom it disagrees as enemies.\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a break with the tradition that you unify the country against opposition abroad, and you act with a certain decorum in dealing with opponents at home,\u201d said the presidential historian Robert Dallek. \u201cThere seems to be none of that in this administration.\u201d\nMr. Trump\u2019s comments about Mr. Schumer and Ms. Pelosi came in an off-the-cuff exchange with reporters as he left the White House for a trip to the border in Texas. It suggested that the president was still basking in the afterglow of his steak dinner with President Xi Jinping in Buenos Aires last month, when he agreed to call a truce in his trade war with China.\nMr. Pompeo\u2019s address, by contrast, was carefully choreographed in both its language and setting \u2014 a highly symbolic effort to discredit what Mr. Obama heralded as America\u2019s \u201cnew beginning\u201d with the Muslim world.\nMr. Obama, the secretary of state said, underestimated the scourge of radical Islam; declined to stand up to the mullahs in Iran, even as they brutally cracked down on protesters; turned the other way while the militants of Hezbollah massed rockets against Israel; and did nothing after President Bashar al-Assad of Syria used sarin gas against his own people.\n\u201cThe age of self-inflicted American shame is over, and so are the policies that produced so much needless suffering,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said at the American University in Cairo. \u201cNow comes the real new beginning.\u201d\nMr. Pompeo lauded Saudi Arabia for working with the United States to curb Iran\u2019s malign influence in the region. He said nothing about human rights and did not mention the killing of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which the C.I.A., an agency he once led, concluded was ordered by the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, a close ally of Mr. Trump.\nTo those who watched Mr. Pompeo harshly question Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2015 when he was a House member investigating the Benghazi attacks, the fact that he would attack a Democratic president was hardly surprising. But that he did it on foreign soil angered some diplomats, who subscribe to the adage that partisan politics should stop \u201cat the water\u2019s edge.\u201d\nEven those who were deeply critical of Mr. Obama\u2019s Middle East policy said they found Mr. Pompeo\u2019s speech off-key \u2014 more a stunt aimed at his boss back in Washington than a serious attempt to set out a new blueprint for American involvement in the region.\n\u201cThere\u2019s something a little cheap about going to Cairo,\u201d said William Kristol, the neoconservative political analyst, who has been equally critical of Mr. Trump. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t approve of Obama\u2019s Cairo speech, the way you do that is not to give another Cairo speech.\u201d\nMr. Kristol noted that Mr. Obama\u2019s speech was also a rebuke of his predecessor, George W. Bush, especially for the Iraq war and his use of torture on suspects after the terrorist attacks of September 2001. But by comparison with Mr. Pompeo, Mr. Obama\u2019s language was delicate.\n\u201c9/11 was an enormous trauma to our country,\u201d Mr. Obama said at Cairo University. \u201cThe fear and anger it provoked was understandable, but in some cases, it led us to act contrary to our own ideals.\u201d\nIn his dissection, Mr. Pompeo did not mention a line that would seem more likely than any other to provoke a Trump official: Mr. Obama\u2019s admission that the United States played a role in overthrowing the democratically elected government of Iran in 1953 \u2014 a coup, he said, that had left a residue of suspicion toward America. Mr. Pompeo\u2019s focus was on making the Iran of today start \u201cbehaving like a normal country.\u201d\nFor all his contempt toward Mr. Obama, Mr. Pompeo fell back on some positions that sounded a lot like those of the last administration. In Syria, he said, the United States would \u201cwork through the U.N.-led process to bring peace and stability to the long-suffering Syrian people.\u201d\nNor is it clear that Mr. Trump\u2019s praise of autocrats is encouraging them to act in ways that benefit the United States. It may actually do the opposite, as the case of Prince Mohammed demonstrates.\nThe trade talks between the United States and China, which ended this week in Beijing, were less rancorous than the shutdown negotiations between Mr. Trump and the Democrats. But they have yet to produce a breakthrough \u2014 and Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to skip the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, later this month because of the shutdown could put off a trade deal even longer.\n\u201cStrongman envy helps explain both the president\u2019s comments and a muddled view of the Middle East,\u201d said William J. Burns, a former deputy secretary of state who is now president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\u201cThe irony,\u201d Mr. Burns said, \u201cis that trashing his predecessor or congressional opponents on the global stage is seen by those same strongmen as evidence of his weakness and manipulability.\u201d", "date": "Jan. 10, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/us/politics/trump-pompeo-china-cairo.html", "tags": "american \u201c home embrace trump pompeo disparage obama opponents autocrats \u2014"}
