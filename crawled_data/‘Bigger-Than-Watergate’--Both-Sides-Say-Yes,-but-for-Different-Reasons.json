{"title": "\u2018Bigger Than Watergate\u2019? Both Sides Say Yes, but for Different Reasons", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump and his critics actually agree on something. If a column he read in a magazine is correct, he wrote on Twitter on Thursday, \u201cthis is bigger than Watergate!\u201d\nNever mind that he was thinking of something different than his adversaries when they use the same phrase. Mr. Trump was referring to what he deems a deep-state conspiracy to get him. His detractors are referring to the various scandals swirling around Mr. Trump.\nWatergate has long been the touchstone for modern American scandal, the mountain of misconduct against which all others are judged. In the 44 years since Richard M. Nixon resigned, virtually every political investigation has been likened to the one that brought down a president, the suffix \u201cgate\u201d applied to all sorts of public flaps, no matter how significant or trivial.\nBut rarely has the comparison been as intense and persistent as during the 16 months since Mr. Trump took office \u2014 a comparison deployed by both sides in hopes of shaping the narrative of wrongdoing. What started out as an inquiry into Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election has mushroomed into questions of perjury, obstruction of justice, conspiracy, abuse of power, illicit spying, hush money, tax fraud, money laundering and influence peddling.\nDepending on what is eventually proven, the core scandal could rival Watergate, in which a \u201cthird-rate burglary\u201d of Democratic National Committee headquarters ultimately revealed a wide-ranging campaign of political sabotage and spying to influence the 1972 presidential election and undercut perceived rivals. In the current case, a hostile foreign power sought to sway the 2016 election and there is evidence that at least some people in Mr. Trump\u2019s circle were willing to collaborate with it to do so.\nMr. Nixon ordered the firing of Archibald Cox, the Watergate special prosecutor, and was ultimately undone by a secret tape recording of him requesting that his aides use the C.I.A. to impede the F.B.I. investigation into the burglary. Mr. Trump fired James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director originally leading the investigation, and has repeatedly pressured the Justice Department and special counsel to shut down the inquiry and investigate his Democratic rivals instead.\n\u201cWatergate pales, really, in my view, compared to what we\u2019re confronting now,\u201d James R. Clapper Jr., the former director of national intelligence, has said. David Corn, an author of \u201cRussian Roulette,\u201d a book about the case, has described it as \u201cmuch bigger than what happened in Watergate.\u201d After Mr. Comey\u2019s dismissal, James Fallows wrote in The Atlantic that \u201cthis scandal looks worse than Watergate.\u201d Carl Bernstein, one of the Washington Post journalists who led the coverage of the Nixon scandal, has said this appears \u201cworse than Watergate in many, many ways.\u201d\nLike Hillary Clinton and the \u201cvast right wing conspiracy,\u201d Mr. Trump and his allies are trying to focus attention on the conduct of their pursuers, arguing that the F.B.I. or the special counsel investigating Russia\u2019s involvement in the election have themselves stepped over the line. The president\u2019s tweet on Thursday seized on a column in a conservative magazine asserting that the F.B.I. most likely had a confidential informant inside Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign in 2016.\nMr. Trump extrapolated that to imply that his predecessor, President Barack Obama, had planted a spy on his team. \u201cWow, word seems to be coming out that the Obama FBI \u2018SPIED ON THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WITH AN EMBEDDED INFORMANT,\u2019\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf so,\u201d he added, \u201cthis is bigger than Watergate!\u201d\nNeither the original column by Andrew C. McCarthy in National Review nor a follow-up directly claimed that Mr. Obama or any of his political appointees had anything to do with the \u201cspy\u201d even if the F.B.I. did have an informant. But that theory fits the larger case that a politically compromised intelligence apparatus manufactured an investigation.\nThe president has advanced the premise in sometimes sensational and uncorroborated ways, as when he accused Mr. Obama of wiretapping Trump Tower, an assertion dismissed by Mr. Trump\u2019s own Justice Department. But questions persist about the F.B.I.\u2019s use of a dossier financed by Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign and the Democrats to obtain a secret warrant against an adviser to Mr. Trump.\nTo Mr. Trump\u2019s allies, that was, yes, bigger than Watergate. \u201cOur sources are telling us that the abuse of power is far bigger than Watergate,\u201d Sean Hannity, the Fox News host and friend of Mr. Trump\u2019s, said in January. \u201cI have long said it is worse than Watergate,\u201d agreed Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa.\nMr. Trump\u2019s theory of the case has been bolstered by some investigators who have gotten in trouble. Two former members of the team working for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, wrote text messages that expressed political views critical of Mr. Trump. Andrew G. McCabe, the former deputy F.B.I. director, was fired for not being forthcoming with an inspector general looking into his conduct.\nThe bigger-than-Watergate analogy, of course, is one of the most overused tropes in American politics. To hear some tell it, Chappaquiddick, Iran-contra, the Keating Five, Whitewater, the Bill Clinton-Monica Lewinsky scandal and the C.I.A. leak case were all worse than Watergate. George W. Bush\u2019s whole presidency was \u201cWorse Than Watergate,\u201d according to the title of a 2004 book written by none other than John Dean, the Watergate figure. Politico actually tabulated 46 scandals or other furors that have been declared worse than Watergate.\nAmong the most prolific purveyors of bigger-than-Watergate comparisons has been Mr. Trump.\nSheriff Joe Arpaio\u2019s investigation into Mr. Obama\u2019s birth certificate \u201ccould dwarf Watergate,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote in 2012.\n\u201cBenghazi is bigger than Watergate,\u201d he wrote a few months later.\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s private email server \u201cis bigger than Watergate,\u201d he wrote in 2016.\nThe decision to begin an investigation into his 2016 campaign? \u201cBigger than Watergate!\u201d he wrote this year.\nIn seeking to undercut the legitimacy of the current investigation, Mr. Trump seized on the first anniversary of Mr. Mueller\u2019s appointment on Thursday to denounce it as a politically inspired waste of time and resources, in some ways echoing Mr. Nixon who at a similar point declared that \u201cone year of Watergate is enough.\u201d\n\u201cCongratulations America,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote, \u201cwe are now into the second year of the greatest Witch Hunt in American History...and there is still No Collusion and No Obstruction. The only Collusion was that done by Democrats who were unable to win an Election despite the spending of far more money!\u201d\nMr. Trump has made a point of saying again and again that there was \u201cno collusion,\u201d but as documents released this week make clear, there was at the very least attempted collusion. His son Donald Trump Jr.; his son-in-law, Jared Kushner; and his campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, met with Russian visitors during the campaign after being promised incriminating information about Mrs. Clinton as \u201cpart of Russia and its government\u2019s support for Mr. Trump.\u201d\nThe Trump team members said the meeting did not yield the dirt on Mrs. Clinton that they had hoped for, but they were willing to meet with visitors advertised as working on behalf of the Russian government to get it. They have argued that there was nothing wrong with this because any campaign would be eager to obtain damaging information about an opponent.\nIn marking the anniversary of Mr. Mueller\u2019s appointment, Mr. Trump was returning to his argument that the inquiry had now gone on too long, a complaint made by other presidents under scrutiny. But it can be much worse. The Watergate investigation took more than two years from the burglary to Mr. Nixon\u2019s resignation. Whitewater lasted six years and Iran-contra seven.\nAn exception was Kenneth W. Starr\u2019s investigation into Mr. Clinton\u2019s false statements under oath about his affair with Ms. Lewinsky, an inquiry that took just eight months. But speed was not much comfort to Mr. Clinton since it ended with an impeachment referral to Congress.", "date": "May 17, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/17/us/politics/watergate-trump-russia-inquiry.html", "tags": "\u2018 different worse watergate investigation wrote \u201d trump say yes reasons sides bigger campaign"}
