{"title": "Dan Bishop, -Bathroom Bill- Sponsor, Wins North Carolina GOP Primary", "content": "RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) \u2014 A state senator best known as the sponsor of a headline-grabbing \u201cbathroom bill\u201d that voided anti-discrimination protections for LGBT people won Tuesday\u2019s Republican primary in a special election for a congressional seat vacant since last year\u2019s election was deemed tainted by fraud.\nSen. Dan Bishop topped nine other GOP candidates seeking the 9th Congressional District nomination. The Charlotte attorney raised the most in campaign contributions, seeded with $250,000 from his personal accounts.\nIn 2016, he sponsored House Bill 2, the law that voided a Charlotte ordinance expanding LGBT rights and prevented similar anti-discrimination rules anywhere else in the state. HB2 was nicknamed the \u201cbathroom bill\u201d because it also directed transgender people to use public bathrooms and showers that matched their birth sex. The measure made waves nationally and prompted boycotts by entertainers, governments and some businesses thinking about moving jobs to North Carolina.\nNow, with his primary win, Bishop faces Democrat Dan McCready in the Sept. 10 general election. McCready was unopposed.\nThe special primary and general elections were required after the state elections board in February determined last year\u2019s contest tainted when Republican Mark Harris used a political operative who collected mail-in ballots. Harris, who narrowly led after November\u2019s votes were counted, opted not to run again.\nWith conflict between President Donald Trump and Washington Democrats heating up after the investigation into Russian support for the president\u2019s 2016 campaign, the 9th District race is expected to serve as a barometer of political tides.\nThe election should draw a heavy infusion of political cash over the next four months, foreshadowed by spending in this primary. The political action committee for the anti-tax Club for Growth endorsed Bishop and spent more than $135,000 attacking rivals Stony Rushing and Leigh Brown. The National Association of Realtors\u2019 PAC spent more than $1 million to benefit Brown.\nMcCready had almost $1.6 million in cash on hand as of May 2, according to Federal Election Commission reports, and after two years of campaigning has built up his name recognition. Despite that, he\u2019ll be swimming upstream in a congressional district that has been in GOP hands since 1963 and which Trump won by 12 percentage points in 2016.\nA Bishop television ad during the primary focused on his support for Trump\u2019s border wall proposal and labeled Democrats \u201ccrazy liberal clowns.\u201d\nRestaurant owner Julie Pressley, 47, of Indian Trail, stopped into her business Tuesday to check on preparations for Rushing\u2019s election-night party, then headed to the polls to vote for the candidate she said she\u2019s known since high school. Rushing and Pressley\u2019s husband serve together on the Union County commission, its executive board. Pressley said that\u2019s allowed her to know that Rushing recognizes he represents people who don\u2019t support him as much as those who do.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen what he stands for as far as the people, what\u2019s best for all the people, not just certain kinds. Whether it be rich people, poor people, whatever, he cares greatly,\u201d said Pressley, who shares Rushing\u2019s low-tax, anti-abortion values. \u201cHe\u2019s very concerned about everybody, whether they like him or not. He wants to do what\u2019s best for \u2019em.\u201d\nMitchell Eudy, 60, of Monroe, said he voted for Dan Bishop in part because he dislikes Rushing. A couple of friends who know Bishop recommended him, said Eudy, who sees the candidate as the most likely to beat McCready.\n\u201cI think he will have a broader appeal for the entire population of the 9th District,\u201d Eudy said.\nThe district stretches from suburban Charlotte to suburban Fayetteville along the South Carolina border.", "date": "\n05/14/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/north-carolina-dan-bishop-bathroom-bill_n_5cdb69e7e4b0c39d2a131c2f", "tags": "primary -bathroom election \u201c dan wins mccready gop carolina district bishop rushing sponsor north bill-"}
