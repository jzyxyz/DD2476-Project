{"title": "Amazon\u2019s Face Recognition Tool Confused 28 Lawmakers With Arrestees", "content": "Amazon\u2019s facial recognition tool incorrectly matched the faces of 28 lawmakers with people in mug shots and disproportionately misidentified people of color in a test by the ACLU.\u00a0\nThe civil rights organization, which has called on Amazon\u00a0to exit the facial recognition industry, compared images of members of Congress with a database of 25,000 mug shots. Of the 28 misidentified lawmakers, 39 percent were people of color, including Reps. John Lewis (D-Ga.), Lacy Clay (D-Mo.) and Luis Guti\u00e9rrez (D-Ill.).\nCustomers can upload images and video to the publicly available Rekognition tool for analysis of people\u2019s faces, objects and text. The ACLU said it used the tool\u2019s default settings and asked an independent expert to verify the results and methodology.\nThe group cautioned law enforcement against using Amazon Rekognition, citing the possibility of bias.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not hard to imagine a police officer getting a \u2018match\u2019 indicating that a person has a previous concealed-weapon arrest, biasing the officer before an encounter even begins,\u201d the report says. \u201cPeople of color are already disproportionately harmed by police practices, and it\u2019s easy to see how Rekognition could exacerbate that.\u201d\nGiven the threats that facial recognition can pose to protesters, immigrants and minorities, the ACLU called on Congress to enact a moratorium on law enforcement using the technology.\nIn response to the report, Lewis and Rep. Jimmy Gomez (D-Calif.) wrote a letter on Thursday requesting to meet with Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.\n\u201cWe are alarmed about the deleterious impact this tool \u2014 if left unchecked without proper, consistent, and rigorous calibration \u2014 will have on communities of color; immigrants; protestors peaceably assembling and others petitioning the Government for a redress of grievances; or any other marginalized group,\u201d they wrote.\u00a0\n   Amazon Rekognition Letter by Michelle on Scribd\nAmazon defended Rekognition by saying that the tool has been used to prevent human trafficking, find missing children and prevent package theft. The company also said that the ACLU\u2019s test results could have been improved by using a high confidence threshold\u00a0\u2015 the probability that a given prediction is correct.\u00a0\n\u201cWhen using facial recognition for law enforcement activities, we guide customers to set a higher threshold of at least 95%\u00a0or higher,\u201d Amazon said.\nHowever, the ACLU said Amazon\u2019s default setting was an 80 percent threshold for face-based user verification. It also disputed that setting a higher threshold would change anything.\n\u201cAmazon seems to have missed, or refuses to acknowledge, the broader point: facial recognition technology in the hands of government is primed for abuse and raises significant civil rights concerns,\u201d ACLU attorney Jacob Snow said in a statement to HuffPost. \u201cChanging the threshold from 80 to 95 percent doesn\u2019t change that. In fact, it could exacerbate it.\u201d\nThe revelation of biases in facial recognition technologies is not new. A\u00a0February study\u00a0by researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford University found that the technology had higher error rates in analyzing darker skinned people and women.\nIn May, the Congressional Black Caucus wrote a letter\u00a0to Bezos expressing concern about the company selling Rekognition to law enforcement agencies. The caucus said that communities of color are more aggressively policed and it fears that implementing Rekognition without further research could exacerbate problematic policing practices.\n\u201cWe are worried deployment of technology like the one you have developed has a high propensity for misuse,\u201d the letter says. \u201cSurveillance of perfectly legitimate and constitutionally protected activity will only further erode the public\u2019s trust in law enforcement.\u201d\nBezos and Amazon did not respond to the letter.\nAmazon has already pitched the facial recognition service to local law enforcement, including Oregon and Orlando.\u00a0Orlando ended a pilot program with Rekognition in June after several civil rights groups spoke out against its use. The police department told Floridapolitics.com that it wanted to uphold privacy laws and protect people\u2019s rights.\nCorrection: This story previously said Rep. Lacy Clay was a congressman for Mississippi. Clay represents Missouri.\nThis article has been updated with the ACLU\u2019s response to HuffPost and Gomez and Lewis\u2019 letter to Bezos.", "date": "\n07/26/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/amazon-face-recognition-tool-confused-28-lawmakers-with-arrestees_n_5b59c0c9e4b0de86f4941823", "tags": "face arrestees facial tool recognition \u201d rekognition law aclu lawmakers confused amazon"}
