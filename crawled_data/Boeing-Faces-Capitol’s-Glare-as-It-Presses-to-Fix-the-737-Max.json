{"title": "Boeing Faces Capitol\u2019s Glare as It Presses to Fix the 737 Max", "content": "RENTON, Wash. \u2014 Boeing on Wednesday made its most overt acknowledgment that new software in its jets could have played a role in two deadly crashes as it tries to convince pilots, airlines and regulators around the world that a coming fix will solve the problem.\nBefore a meeting with more than 200 pilots and airline executives at its factory in Renton, Wash., Boeing, for the first time, publicly laid out its proposed updates to the software as well other changes to the 737 Max that it hopes will get the plane flying again. The changes would give pilots more control over the system and make it less likely to be set off by faulty data, two issues at the center of the investigations into the crashes.\n\u201cThe rigor and thoroughness of the design and testing that went into the Max gives us complete confidence that the changes we\u2019re making will address any of these accidents,\u201d Mike Sinnett, Boeing\u2019s vice president for product strategy, said in a press briefing.\nThe company, which was eager to complete the plane quickly for competitive reasons, also faced new scrutiny in Washington on Wednesday over the development and certification of the jet, a process that regulators heavily delegated to Boeing. Senators, in two congressional hearings with Boeing\u2019s regulators, pressed for more oversight and raised the possibility of overhauling the system.\nThe acting head of the Federal Aviation Administration, in a hearing of the Senate Commerce Committee\u2019s aviation subcommittee, said that the agency initially scrutinized the new software independently, but ultimately left it to Boeing. The official, Daniel Elwell, also said he did not believe the automated system had been tested with a scenario involving a faulty sensor, which was a concern in a Lion Air crash in Indonesia in October.\n[Here\u2019s what you need to know about the deadly Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air crashes, and what Boeing has been doing since.]\n\u201cThe F.A.A. decided to do safety on the cheap, which is neither cheap nor safe,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut. He added that he planned to introduce legislation to reform the system, which he said \u201cis so fatally riddled with flaws.\u201d\nThe F.A.A. \u201cput the fox in charge of the henhouse,\u201d he said.\nBoeing and the F.A.A. are playing defense on two fronts, as prosecutors, regulators and lawmakers investigate their responses to the crashes and their approval of the plane.\nDuring his hearing, Calvin L. Scovel III, the Transportation Department\u2019s inspector general, said he was looking into how the F.A.A. handled the crisis. In the days after an Ethiopian Airlines crash that killed 157 people this month, global regulators grounded the jets, while the United States initially held off doing the same.\n\u201cClearly, confidence in F.A.A. as the gold standard for aviation safety has been shaken,\u201d he said. Mr. Scovel said he wanted to understand why the agency was the last major aviation regulator in the world to \u201cdrive risk to zero\u201d by grounding the 737 Max.\nMr. Scovel also said he would investigate why the F.A.A. approved the software system, which is known as MCAS, including the decision not to include it in the operating instructions and not to require additional training for pilots. When the plane was introduced, pilots learned about the 737 Max on an iPad.\nRobert L. Sumwalt, the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, also said in the hearing that his agency was \u201cexamining the U.S. design certification process.\u201d\nThe F.A.A. has long allowed plane makers to help certify that their new aircraft meet safety standards. In recent years, Boeing was able to choose its own employees to help regulators approve the 737 Max.\nIn a separate hearing with the Senate Appropriations Committee\u2019s transportation subcommittee, the Transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, called the practice \u201cnecessary.\u201d\nMs. Chao stressed that the F.A.A. sets safety standards that manufacturers must meet while developing aircraft. The certification process, she said, \u201cis, of course, subject to oversight and supervision by the F.A.A.\u201d\nWhen asked by the subcommittee\u2019s chairwoman, Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, about concerns that the arrangement \u201csacrifices potentially the safety of the traveling public,\u201d Ms. Chao said that the possibility was \u201ctroubling.\u201d\nMr. Elwell, during his hearing, said that the F.A.A. initially oversaw certification for the software, but delegated more authority over time, \u201cwhen we had the comfort level\u201d that the Boeing employees were knowledgeable enough about the system.\nMr. Elwell later said that practice was \u201cpart of the fabric of what we\u2019ve used to become as safe as we are today\u201d and that without it, the F.A.A. would need 10,000 more employees and $1.8 billion for its certification offices.\nBoeing has defended the process, saying the plane adhered to all F.A.A. safety rules.\nA Boeing official cautioned against drawing any definite conclusions until more is known. \u201cIn general, the process has worked and continues to work, and we see no reason to overhaul the process,\u201d this official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the investigations.\nThe Boeing official said that in most accidents, many things go wrong. Based on what is known about the crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia, Boeing said it felt that MCAS was in need of updating.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen two accidents now and we believe it is appropriate to make that link in the chain more robust,\u201d the official said.\nThe updated software, which Boeing outlined on Wednesday, will rely on data from two so-called angle of attack sensors, so the plane won\u2019t have a single point of failure. It will also make it easier for pilots to override the system, which was originally designed to push down the nose of the plane repeatedly and aggressively.\nThe company said the new software had been extensively tested and officials from the F.A.A. had taken test flights on updated jets. Pilots from United States airlines have also tried out the updated system in flight simulators.\nDennis A. Muilenburg, Boeing\u2019s chief executive, has avoided the spotlight in recent weeks and was not in Renton on Wednesday for the news briefing or the meeting with pilots and executives.\nBoeing also said it would retrofit jets with a safety feature that was previously optional. The feature \u2014 known as a disagree light, which is activated if two key sensors on the plane do not produce the same readings \u2014 will be standard on new Max planes. The disagree light might have helped the pilots in the Lion Air crash identify the source of the problem.\nDuring a testy exchange, Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, repeatedly pressed the F.A.A. official, Mr. Elwell, on whether all available safety features should be required on planes. Mr. Elwell responded that \u201csafety-critical pieces of equipment on an aircraft are mandatory.\u201d He added, \u201cIf there is any manufacturer that sells a safety-critical part a la carte, we will not permit it.\u201d\nBut Mr. Elwell added that he found it \u201chard to believe that a safety company like an airline would save a couple thousand dollars on an option that might improve safety.\u201d\nAlthough the fix is apparently ready, Boeing provided no timetable for installing it. The F.A.A. must first approve the new software and the training. Then, Boeing said, each existing 737 Max will need to be manually upgraded, a procedure that takes an hour for each plane. Finally, Max pilots will need to receive an additional 30-minute training program about the software.\nEven if the F.A.A. does approve the changes, regulators in Europe, Canada, China, Brazil and elsewhere might move more slowly. \u201cCertification around the world will be at the discretion of those regulators around the world, and so we can\u2019t comment on timing,\u201d Mr. Sinnett said.", "date": "March 27, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/27/business/boeing-737-max.html", "tags": "faces f.a.a pilots software glare boeing capitol plane safety \u201d regulators fix presses max"}
