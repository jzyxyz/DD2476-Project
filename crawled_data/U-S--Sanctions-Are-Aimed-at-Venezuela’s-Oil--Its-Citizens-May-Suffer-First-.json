Its Citizens May Suffer First.", "content": "CARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 When President Trump slapped surprise oil sanctions on Venezuela aimed at toppling President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, exports plunged and banking froze as the effects hit harder and faster than expected.\nBut in recent days it has become clear that Venezuela\u2019s state oil company, the main target of the sanctions as Mr. Maduro\u2019s bankroller, has found a few ways to survive, with some Russian help.\nMany in Venezuela fear that the sanctions imposed last week will push the already suffering nation of about 30 million people into an even greater humanitarian catastrophe.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure the U.S. has a Plan B if this doesn\u2019t work in getting rid of Maduro,\u201d said Francisco Rodr\u00edguez, a Venezuelan economist at Torino Capital, a brokerage firm. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that if these sanctions are implemented in their current form, we\u2019re looking at starvation.\u201d\nVenezuelan oil exports to the United States, which provide the biggest source of cash for Mr. Maduro\u2019s government, plummeted 40 percent last week. Customers suspended contracts, banks suspended Venezuelan accounts, and a dozen tankers filled with Venezuelan crude sat stranded across the Caribbean.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t charge, we can\u2019t receive money. Our finances are paralyzed,\u201d said Reinaldo Quintero, head of the Venezuelan Oil Chamber, an industry group that represents the country\u2019s 500 biggest oil service companies. \u201cThere will be major collateral damage.\u201d\nBut crucial help came from Venezuela\u2019s biggest oil investor, Russia\u2019s state-run Rosneft. The company said in a presentation this week that it would increase its output in Venezuela this year despite the sanctions, and that it remained committed to the country, throwing a lifeline to Mr. Maduro\u2019s government.\nVenezuela\u2019s economy has already shrunk by about half since Mr. Maduro came to power in 2013, causing millions of people to flee the country or skip meals to survive.\nNow the new American sanctions could cut Venezuela\u2019s oil exports by two-thirds, to just $14 billion this year, and lead to a 26 percent reduction in the economy\u2019s size, according to Mr. Rodr\u00edguez, the economist.\nMr. Trump said the oil sanctions were meant to punish Mr. Maduro for human rights violations and force him to cede power to Juan Guaid\u00f3, the opposition leader whom the United States and many other countries have recognized as the rightful Venezuelan president.\nThe sanctions announced by the Treasury Department on Jan. 28 banned United States companies and individuals from dealing with Venezuela\u2019s state-run oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, or Pdvsa, which provides about 90 percent of the country\u2019s hard currency. The sanctions essentially shut Venezuelan oil out of the American market.\nMr. Maduro, accusing the United States of sponsoring a coup attempt, has vowed to remain in power.\nBefore the sanctions, his country imported about 120,000 barrels of oil and refined petroleum products a day from the United States. The Venezuelans blended the lighter American oil with their own thick crude oil so it could flow through pipelines to ports. The American shipments halted last week.\nBut Russia\u2019s state-run oil company, Rosneft, agreed to continue providing Pdvsa with vital oil products in exchange for Venezuelan crude, partly replacing the lost American supplies, according to two oil traders and two partners of a Venezuelan firm familiar with the matter.\nSuch deals allow Pdvsa to continue functioning \u2014 albeit a day at a time \u2014 without access to the international banking system. Pdvsa officials told partners this week that the country had secured gasoline supplies until late March, avoiding the imminent energy crisis caused by the American sanctions.\nA Rosneft spokesman said the company pursues only business interests in Venezuela and declined to comment on any barter deals with Pdvsa.\nEnergy experts said the nature of the global oil market was such that Venezuela would be able to keep some oil income coming by lowering the price and finding alternative customers in Asia.\n\u201cAt the end of the day there will always be someone who will buy a limited volume of crude that doesn\u2019t have a home,\u201d said Ali Moshiri, who ran Chevron\u2019s operations in Venezuela and elsewhere in Latin America until 2017, \u201cbut it will be at a heavy discount.\u201d\nMany Venezuelans worry that while the reduced revenue streams may allow Mr. Maduro to remain in power, they will drastically worsen the already dire shortages of food and medicine and shutter the few remaining private businesses.\n\u201cIf these sanctions don\u2019t force the endgame soon, they will cause a lot of pain for the people,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Bodas, an anti-government oil union leader in Puerto La Cruz. \u201cThe rich will not stop getting richer, it\u2019s the workers who will shoulder the cost of these measures.\u201d\nThe opposition plans to bring American-sponsored humanitarian aid \u2014 including medical kits and enough food to feed 5,000 Venezuelans for 10 days \u2014 into the country through the border with Colombia.\nBut it was stopped on Friday by the Maduro administration, which blocked the bridge the supply caravan had to cross.\nBy forcing a showdown at the border, where the Venezuelan authorities refused to let in essential supplies, opposition leaders hoped to put an uncomfortable spotlight on Mr. Maduro and the armed forces \u2014 the group whose support is vital to his remaining in power.\n\u201cThis is plainly not a humanitarian mission,\u201d said Adam Isacson, director of defense oversight at the Washington Office on Latin America, of the opposition. \u201cThey want the visual optic. They want to force the Venezuelan military to make a decision \u2014 damned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t.\u201d\nOn Friday, Mr. Maduro said the aid was not needed.\n\u201cThey want to draw a caricature of a country in a humanitarian crisis, a dictatorship, and the U.S. opening their hands to help a people in need,\u201d he said of the opposition. \u201cThe reality is that it is not any help, it is a message of humiliation to a people.\u201d\nBut in pharmacies across the Venezuelan capital, desperate patients searching for scarce medicine said they fear new sanctions could push the already collapsing health care system over the edge.\n\u201cIf this gets worse this week because of the measures to pressure the government, I\u2019m going to go crazy,\u201d said Juliana L\u00f3pez, owner of a small pharmacy on the outskirts of the capital, as she turned away customer after customer. \u201cWe\u2019re already just barely surviving. To get worse we would have to be hit by a meteorite.\u201d\nBecause of the prevalence of the United States financial system and the dollar in the global economy, the ripple effects of the sanctions spread far beyond American borders, making it extremely difficult for the Venezuelan government to continue buying and selling goods.\nThe United States has remained Venezuela\u2019s main trading partner under Mr. Maduro despite his government\u2019s anti-American rhetoric, accounting for about 50 percent of the country\u2019s exports and imports.\nDespite the rising tensions, Venezuela\u2019s elite has continued doing most of its business through the United States, using American banks and suppliers.\nIt was the sudden loss of the American market to Venezuelan state companies and their local suppliers that struck with such force.\n\u201cNo one has been prepared for this, no one had any contingency plans or accounts in other currencies,\u201d said one Pdvsa contractor, who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid recriminations from the company.\nThere is no guarantee that Pdvsa, even if it can limp along with severely reduced operations, will ever recover. Energy experts say the sanctions are tighter than what many first thought a week ago.\nThe Treasury Department in recent days specified that the sanctions also extend to other Venezuelan companies, barring them from using the American financial system to do business with Pdvsa.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing that Pdvsa\u2019s partners are taking precautions; we\u2019re seeing contracts being canceled,\u201d said Risa Grais-Targow, a Latin America expert at the Eurasia Group, a political risk consulting firm in Washington.\n\u201cIf Pdvsa can\u2019t quickly find alternative export markets or they can\u2019t blend their crude,\u201d she said, \u201cyou get into a situation where there is nowhere for the production to go and you have to start shuttering it and that is a huge problem.\u201d", "date": "Feb. 8, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/08/world/americas/venezuela-sanctions-maduro.html", "tags": "american sanctions citizens may venezuelan first maduro venezuela u.s. suffer \u201d oil aimed"}
