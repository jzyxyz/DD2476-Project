{"title": "Amazon Echo, a.k.a. Alexa, Is a Personal Aide in Need of Schooling", "content": "THIS week, I asked a friend for help: \u201cAlexa, can you write this review for me?\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your question?\u201d Alexa responded.\n\u201cCan you write this review for me?\u201d\n\u201cReview is spelled R-E-V-I-E-W.\u201d\n\u201cThanks,\u201d I said. \u201cThat about sums it up.\u201d\nO.K., so Alexa isn\u2019t perfect; far from it, in fact. If there is one glaring flaw in the Amazon Echo \u2014 the tiny wireless speaker and artificially intelligent personal assistant, a machine that one always addresses with the honorific \u201cAlexa,\u201d as if she\u2019s some kind of digital monarch \u2014 it is that she is quite stupid.\nIf Alexa were a human assistant, you\u2019d fire her, if not have her committed. \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t understand the question I heard\u201d is her favorite response, though honestly she really doesn\u2019t sound very sorry. She\u2019ll resort to that line whether you ask her questions answered by a simple Google search (\u201cHow much does a cup of flour weigh?\u201d) or something more complicated (\u201cAlexa, what was that Martin Scorsese movie with Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro?\u201d).\nOther times, she is mind-numbingly literal. One night during the N.B.A. playoffs, I asked, \u201cAlexa, what\u2019s the score of the basketball game?\u201d She proceeded to give me a two-minute, 18-part definition of the word \u201cscore\u201d that included \u201ca seduction culminating in sexual intercourse.\u201d Not exactly what I was going for.\nAnd yet, after spending three weeks testing the Echo, I really kind of love Alexa. She is just smart enough to be useful. And she keeps getting smarter. This week, after a long invitation-only preview period, Amazon began selling the Echo to the public. At $179.99, Alexa is more expensive than I\u2019d like. (Subscribers to Amazon\u2019s $99-a-year Prime subscription service could buy the Echo for only $100 during the preview.) But if you\u2019re the type who enjoys taking chances on early, halfway useful tech novelties, the Echo is a fun thing to try.\nAnd if you\u2019re anything like me, after a week with the Echo, you may feel the device begin to change how you think about home tech. It will not seem far-fetched to expect that one day soon, you\u2019ll have an all-knowing, all-seeing talking assistant to control your lights, thermostat, entertainment system and just about anything else at home. In Alexa, Amazon has created the perfect interface to control your home; if it adds some more intelligence, it would be quite handy.\nThe Echo is a stout, plain-looking cylinder, about the height of a toaster, that you can park just about anywhere you have Wi-Fi access, though it seems most useful in the kitchen. It comes with a remote control that you don\u2019t really need, because after a quick initial setup using your smartphone, you can control pretty much everything the Echo does with your voice. (The remote does have a microphone that allows you to speak to the Echo from far away.) From there, the Echo is terrifically easy to use \u2014 say \u201cAlexa\u201d and ask your question.\nAt the moment, there are only a handful of uses for the Echo. She\u2019s great at telling you the weather, adding stuff to your shopping list, reordering items you frequently buy from Amazon, giving you a heads-up about your nearing calendar appointments, and answering the most basic of search queries.\nShe is pretty good at playing music, though her main source is Amazon Prime Music, a streaming service that is included with a Prime membership. Prime Music\u2019s selection is dreadfully limited, though, and at the moment, the Echo can\u2019t connect to many other streaming services. Thankfully, with a few quick voice commands, Alexa can connect to your phone like any other Bluetooth speaker. That way, she can take control of music you play from most apps, including streaming apps like Spotify. You can\u2019t call out for specific songs this way, but you can say \u201cAlexa, pause\u201d or \u201cAlexa, next\u201d and she\u2019ll control the tunes playing from your phone.\nThe Echo is also a very good kitchen timer. Put your cookies in the oven; yell out, \u201cAlexa, set timer for 12 minutes\u201d; and she\u2019s off. It\u2019s far easier than fumbling with buttons on the microwave, especially when you have your hands full.\nBut wait a minute \u2014 can\u2019t you do pretty much all this on your phone, your smartwatch or many other devices? Yes, you can, but Alexa is right there. She\u2019s always plugged in. She\u2019s always listening, and she\u2019s fast. It\u2019s surprising how much of a difference a few milliseconds make in maintaining the illusion of intelligence in our machines. Because Alexa is far quicker to spring into action than Siri, Apple\u2019s digital personal assistant, especially Siri on the Apple Watch, I found her to be much more pleasant to use, even if she is frequently wrong.\nAmazon says that it plans to constantly improve the Echo. During the preview period, it added a host of new features, including the ability to control some smart-home devices, built-in integration with the Pandora streaming service, and traffic information for your morning commute. I\u2019m hoping Amazon creates an open system \u2014 what developers call an API \u2014 for the Echo, which will allow a wide variety of online services and apps to connect to the device. If it moves nimbly, keeping ahead of Apple and Google, Amazon could transform the Echo into a something like a residential hub, the one device to control pretty much everything attached to your home.\nAt the moment, that dream is far off. But dumb as she sometimes sounds, Alexa may be just smart enough to make it happen.", "date": "June 24, 2015", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/25/technology/personaltech/amazon-echo-aka-alexa-is-a-personal-aide-in-need-of-schooling.html", "tags": "need much far personal control a.k.a \u201d schooling one alexa aide \u2014 echo amazon"}
