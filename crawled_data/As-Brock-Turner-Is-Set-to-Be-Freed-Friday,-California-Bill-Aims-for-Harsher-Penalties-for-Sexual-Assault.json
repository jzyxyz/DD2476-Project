{"title": "As Brock Turner Is Set to Be Freed Friday, California Bill Aims for Harsher Penalties for Sexual Assault", "content": "Days before the scheduled release of a former Stanford University student from jail on Friday after serving three months for sexual assault, California lawmakers voted to close what they called a sentencing loophole by mandating harsher penalties for similar assaults.\nVictims advocates and others are planning a protest outside the San Jose Hall of Justice at 10 a.m. on Friday to greet the release of the former student, Brock Turner. And amid an effort to impeach the judge, Aaron Persky \u2014 who was denounced for what many called an egregiously lenient sentence of six months \u2014 the judge has spoken out on a website, Retain Judge Persky.\nWithout addressing any specific case, Judge Persky defends his record, saying he\u2019s a fair-minded judge and a prosecutor of hate crimes: \u201cI have a reputation for being fair to both sides.\u201d\nThe California bill, inspired by the Stanford case, cleared its last hurdle in the California Assembly on Monday. It is now before Gov. Jerry Brown. A spokesman for the governor declined on Tuesday to comment on his plans for the bill, adding that Mr. Brown has until the end of September to sign or veto it.\n\u201cIt took the lax sentence in the Brock Turner case that drew international scorn to get this done,\u201d Assemblyman Bill Dodd, a Democrat who is a sponsor of the bill, said in an interview on Tuesday. The legislation, he added, is about more than sentencing. \u201cIt\u2019s about supporting victims and changing the culture,\u201d he added.\nThe bill would change state law, which treats sexual assaults involving penetration differently when a victim is unconscious or severely intoxicated. Because such victims cannot resist an attack, the state does not currently consider such assaults to involve the use of force, a factor for mandatory denial of probation. The bill would extend that automatic denial to all perpetrators of penetrative sexual assaults, regardless of the state of the victim.\nThat legislature\u2019s action came less than a week after the Santa Clara County Superior Court announced that Judge Persky would stop hearing criminal cases and handle civil cases instead, effective Sept. 6. He had asked for the transfer, the court\u2019s presiding judge said.\nNow, Judge Persky is in a battle to retain his position. A petition seeking hearings to impeach him has collected 1.3 million signatures since it was started three months. The movement to remove him has also raised more than $250,000.\nBut in a statement posted to the website of the campaign to retain him, the judge says: \u201cI believe strongly in judicial independence. I took an oath to uphold the Constitution, not to appease politicians or ideologues. When your own rights and property are at stake, you want the judge to make a fair and lawful decision, free from political influence.\u201d\nHe also noted his work prosecuting hate crimes and \u201csexually violent predators.\u201d\nBut the Stanford law professor leading the recall effort, Michele Dauber, told The Washington Post that she believes Judge Persky\u2019s sentencing reflected a \u201clongstanding pattern\u201d of bias in favor of white or privileged young men.\nIn an interview in June, Professor Dauber, a friend of the victim\u2019s family, said the judge\u2019s sentence, which included three years\u2019 probation, had made female college students unsafe and cited what she called the judge\u2019s misapplication of the law in taking Mr. Turner\u2019s age, academic achievement and alcohol consumption into consideration.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to declare that a high-achieving perpetrator is an unusual case, then you\u2019re saying to women on college campuses that they don\u2019t deserve the full protection of the law in the state of California,\u201d the professor said.\nProfessor Dauber had said that because the judge had no opponent and will be \u201cautomatically re-elected\u201d in November, the recall campaign was the only way to remove him. (Judge Persky won his race in the California primary.)\nJudge Persky tossed out two counts of rape and sentenced Mr. Turner, 21, a champion swimmer, to six months in jail and three years\u2019 probation. (Inmates often serve under the possibility of a reduced sentence of half their time for good behavior.) Mr. Turner was convicted in March of three felony counts, two of sexual penetration and one of intent to commit rape after attacking the 23-year-old woman.\nTwo graduate students witnessed the assault and intervened, one of them chasing and tackling Mr. Turner as he fled.\nThe judge described his reasoning at the time: \u201cA prison sentence would have a severe impact on him,\u201d he said in court, according to reports. \u201cI think he will not be a danger to others.\u201d\nMany viewed that sentence as far too light. The victim\u2019s 7,244-word courtroom statement was published by BuzzFeed and other news outlets. It was read on the air by news anchors and on the floor of the House of Representatives. Lawmakers created legislation to strengthen laws against sexual assault. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. called the victim \u201ca warrior \u2014 with a solid steel spine.\u201d\nThe furor grew after Professor Dauber tweeted a statement by the defendant\u2019s father complaining that his son\u2019s life had been ruined for \u201c20 minutes of action.\u201d\nThe Stanford case wasn\u2019t the only one in which Judge Persky\u2019s decisions were called into question. He was also the subject of a successful motion in June by the district attorney\u2019s office to stop him from presiding over a trial involving a male nurse accused of touching, without any medical reason, the genitals of a sedated female patient.\nJeffrey F. Rosen, the Santa Clara district attorney, said in a statement that he had lost confidence in the judge, and cited another case that Judge Persky had been involved with.\nJury selection in that case, involving a traffic stop and stolen items, had been more difficult than usual, with about 16 jurors refusing to serve because, they said, they were unsettled by the judge\u2019s sentence in the Stanford trial.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a juror tell a judge, I can\u2019t be fair because of the judge,\u201d said James Leonard, the supervising deputy district attorney. \u201cIt was shocking.\u201d", "date": "Aug. 31, 2016", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/01/us/as-brock-turner-is-set-to-be-freed-friday-california-bill-aims-for-harsher-penalties-for-sexual-assault.html", "tags": "set freed sentence stanford persky judge \u201d penalties turner california bill friday aims sexual case brock harsher assault"}
