{"title": "A Malaysian Insta-City Becomes a Flash Point for Chinese Colonialism \u2014 and Capital Flight", "content": "Off the southern coast of Malaysia, a futuristic city is rising from the sea. An artificial island, the first of four that will anchor the projected $100 billion Forest City project, has materialized in the Straits of Johor, the channel that separates the Malay Peninsula from Singapore. Three years ago, this was open water. Today, a phalanx of half-built high-rises stretches across the new island, a flock of construction cranes hovering above. When completed, Forest City is expected to cover an area the size of four Central Parks and accommodate 700,000 residents. The metropolis will evoke a high-tech Atlantis, a \u201csmart\u201d eco-city where spacecraft-shaped towers will be draped with greenery, all motorized traffic will flow underground and every inch of the island cluster will be monitored by a state-of-the-art security system. In the words of a promotional video: \u201cIt is a pride and dream paradise for all mankind.\u201d\nForest City is billed as one of China\u2019s biggest overseas development projects, but it is hardly the world\u2019s first insta-city. We are, in fact, living in the golden age of the master-planned metropolis. In the last two decades, more than 100 new cities have been (or are being) created from scratch, according to Sarah Moser, an assistant professor of geography at Montreal\u2019s McGill University, where she runs a research lab that tracks new cities. These recent additions to the map tend to arise in developing countries like Morocco, Nigeria, Uganda, Myanmar and Indonesia.\nThe center of this city-building frenzy is China, where most of the urban landscape has been created anew over the last 30 years. Forest City, however, takes the trend into a strange new dimension. It sits inside Malaysian territory, yet it has been designed, financed and marketed mainly by and for mainland Chinese (and members of the Chinese diaspora). Forest City\u2019s developer, Country Garden, is one of many powerful Chinese real estate companies that have expanded overseas as growth slows at home. Its Malaysian partner is a company controlled by Sultan Ibrahim Sultan Iskandar, royal heir to the 500-year-old sultanate of Johor. Even as the sultan ties his family legacy to the project \u2014 his portrait hangs prominently in the sales gallery \u2014 he has also afforded the Chinese investors a remarkable degree of autonomy. After all, Country Garden knows exactly how to appeal to the needs and longings of China\u2019s aspirational middle class.\nA staff of 70 salespeople in bright yellow golf shirts greets prospective customers, and their sales pitches highlight many reasons Chinese are looking to invest abroad: a clean environment (none of China\u2019s pollution here); a Western education (a Minnesota boarding school will open a Forest City branch this fall); a hedge against an uncertain future (Malaysia offers long-term visas as well as a path toward citizenship). There\u2019s also the comfort of high-level security \u2014 retinal scans and facial-recognition cameras \u2014 for a population conditioned to think of Big Brother as benign. Nepali guards patrol Forest City around the clock \u2014 in part, one salesman said, because Chinese clients might not feel comfortable interacting with local Muslims.\nWithin a year of putting its initial offerings on the market in December 2015, Forest City had sold 80 percent of all units on the first island. The project is a relatively cheap alternative to property havens in North America, Australia and China itself. A luxury two-bedroom apartment costs only $180,000 in Forest City, about a third of what it would command in Shanghai. Still, the sheer volume in sales means that Forest City raked in more than $3 billion in 2016 alone, according to the company. Much of this money was Chinese flight capital, but Country Garden has tried to make buying into Forest City seem almost patriotic. One Olympic-themed show unit features the gold-medal shooters Du Li and Pang Wei, who have invested here, too. (A sign proclaims in Chinese: \u201cWelcome home, Olympic champions!\u201d) Throughout the sales tour, potential buyers are reminded that Forest City sits in a strategic geographical position for China \u2014 astride a vital maritime route that connects their homeland with the rest of the world.\nBut after a banner year in 2016, Forest City encountered significant setbacks in 2017 \u2014 revealing some of the fault lines created by the phenomenal growth of Chinese wealth. The uncomfortable fact that hundreds of thousands of Chinese may soon be residents of Malaysia led a former prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, to lash out at the project last year. \u201cWe should realize that once we sell land to others, we no longer have any ownership over it,\u201d he said. The sultan of Johor accused Mahathir of \u201cplaying the politics of fear and race\u201d ahead of nationwide elections in which the former prime minister is running. But Mahathir, 92, railed on. He even compared the situation to the sultanate\u2019s sale of the neighboring island of Temasek to the British nearly two centuries ago. That island is now the wealthy city-state Singapore.\nGeopolitics only added to the controversy. Forest City sits just a few miles off the Straits of Malacca, an indispensable channel for commerce ever since the beginning of the global spice trade in the 16th century. Today the straits are China\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel, a vulnerable choke point through which 80 percent of its oil imports flow. China is building pipelines, ports and railways in Pakistan and Myanmar to relieve its dependence on this waterway. It is also lavishing Malaysia with large investments, like a $7.2 billion port complex in Malacca, to secure its position along the straits. Forest City is not a government infrastructure project, but it is a largely autonomous Chinese outpost in a strategic location. \u201cWhere else in the world has a foreign company created new land in another country, populated it with people from its home country and asserted sovereignty over it?\u201d Moser asks. \u201cThis is a brand-new level of colonial expansion.\u201d\nAnd yet the greatest blow to Forest City last year was struck by the Chinese government, through a set of new restrictions that underscore the tension inherent in Beijing\u2019s economic vision, in which it encourages companies to \u201cgo global\u201d yet fears the exodus of its citizens\u2019 new wealth. Over the last decade, China has seen an estimated $3.8 trillion in capital leave the country, much of it going into offshore real estate. In an effort to crack down on rampant capital flight, Beijing tightened its capital controls, making it nearly impossible for investors to send large amounts of money out of the country. The limit on foreign transfers remains $50,000 a year per person, but now senders must sign a pledge that no money will be used to buy property \u2014 and face investigation if they violate the pledge. The tougher controls have strengthened China\u2019s currency and stabilized its foreign reserves, but many Chinese investors, including some Forest City customers, were left stranded: They had made down payments on their tropical idylls, but banks wouldn\u2019t let them send the rest.\nSoon after the restrictions were put in place, Country Garden shuttered its Forest City sales offices in China \u2014 \u201cfor renovation,\u201d a notice said \u2014 and scrambled to find new customers in Dubai, Japan, Thailand and beyond. Yu Runze, the president of Country Garden Pacificview, the joint venture that runs Forest City, told Today, a Singapore newspaper, last year that capital controls gave them \u201can opportunity to shift our sales strategy to be more international.\u201d Forest City hasn\u2019t revealed its 2017 sales figures, so it\u2019s hard to tell just how much its business has suffered.\nStill, on a recent Saturday, a few hundred visitors \u2014 almost all of them Mandarin speakers \u2014 circulated through the sales gallery. They gaped at the sleek scale model with \u201csold out\u201d towers, tested a facial-recognition camera and ate dumplings at one of the Chinese restaurants. No transactions seemed to be taking place, but outside, the flock of construction cranes kept moving and Forest City continued to rise. \u201cThere are so many permutations on how this project can move ahead that it\u2019s unwise to write it off prematurely,\u201d Yu said. \u201cNever underestimate the resolve of a new China.\u201d /\u2022/", "date": "March 13, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/13/magazine/a-malaysian-insta-city-becomes-a-flash-point-for-chinese-colonialism-and-capital-flight.html", "tags": "colonialism country forest china sales city new \u201d capital chinese flight point insta-city \u2014 flash malaysian becomes"}
