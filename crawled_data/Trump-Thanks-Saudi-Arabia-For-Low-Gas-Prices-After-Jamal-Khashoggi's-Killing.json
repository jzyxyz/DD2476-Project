{"title": "Trump Thanks Saudi Arabia For Low Gas Prices After Jamal Khashoggi's Killing", "content": "President Donald Trump\u00a0on Wednesday thanked Saudi Arabia for the declining price of oil, one day after he said the United States would back the country even if Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u00a0ordered the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\u201cOil prices getting lower. Great! Like a big Tax Cut for America and the World. Enjoy! $54, was just $82,\u201d Trump said in a tweet. \u201cThank you to Saudi Arabia, but let\u2019s go lower!\u201d\nTrump on Tuesday issued a bizarre statement reaffirming that the U.S. considers Saudi Arabia an ally, despite the CIA conclusion that the crown prince ordered the death of Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and critic of the kingdom.\n\u201cWe may\u00a0never\u00a0know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Mr. Jamal Khashoggi,\u201d Trump said in the statement. \u201cIn any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They have been a great ally in our very important fight against Iran.\u201d\nSaudi Arabia has acknowledged people close to the crown prince were involved in the assassination, but has denied he had personal knowledge of it. Trump appeared to take their word on that, casting doubt on his intelligence agencies.\n\u201cOur intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event \u2013 maybe he did and maybe he didn\u2019t!\u201d Trump\u2019s statement said.\nSens. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) and Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, responded to Trump\u2019s statement with a letter demanding answers on Khashoggi\u2019s death, asking the president to \u201cspecifically address whether Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman is responsible for Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s murder.\u201d\nOil prices plunged in recent days to the lowest this year before recovering slightly on Wednesday. The drop may have been fanned by Trump\u2019s Nov. 12 tweet warning Saudi Arabia not to cut production, analysts told The New York Times. Other factors include fears that Trump\u2019s trade battle with China will reduce demand and the realization that U.S. sanctions against Iran haven\u2019t curbed world oil supplies as much as anticipated.\nHayley Miller contributed to this report.", "date": "\n11/21/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-saudi-arabia-oil-prices_n_5bf55699e4b0eb6d930a2d28", "tags": "thanks khashoggi jamal gas saudi prices trump \u201d killing low crown prince oil arabia"}
