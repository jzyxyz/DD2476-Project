{"title": "Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner Indicted Again on Corruption Charges", "content": "BUENOS AIRES \u2014 Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, the Argentine former president who with her late husband dominated the country\u2019s politics for most of this century, was indicted Tuesday on fraud and corruption charges involving huge public works projects. It was her second indictment since she left office last year.\nSeveral members of her administration, including Julio De Vido, a former planning minister, and Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez, a former public works secretary, were also charged in the case. L\u00e1zaro B\u00e1ez, a businessman long associated with Mrs. Kirchner and her husband, N\u00e9stor Kirchner, was charged, too. One of his companies, Austral Construcciones, was accused of being the beneficiary of corruption.\nThe former officials are accused of being part of an illegal association \u201cthat operated between at least May 8, 2003, and Dec. 9, 2015, and was created to commit crimes to illegally and deliberately appropriate itself with funds that were assigned to road works,\u201d according to the indictment. The charges focus on 52 projects in the southern province of Santa Cruz, where N\u00e9stor Kirchner was governor for more than a decade until he became president of Argentina in 2003.\nJuli\u00e1n Ercolini, a federal judge, said that Mr. B\u00e1ez\u2019s company, which did not exist until shortly before Mr. Kirchner became president, was awarded contracts worth $2.97 billion. That included 15 percent surcharges above the original cost of the contracts, Judge Ercolini added.\nMrs. Kirchner, who was president for two terms between 2007 and 2015, has vehemently denied any wrongdoing, and characterizes her legal troubles as little more than political persecution by her successor and rival, President Mauricio Macri.\n\u201cConspiracy was the crime that was created by de facto governments and used by all the dictatorships to persecute opposition leaders,\u201d Mrs. Kirchner wrote on Twitter after the indictment was announced.\nEven while she was in office, she accused United States interests and others of being part of a crusade to undermine leftist leaders in Latin America, including her. She often compares her situation to that of Dilma Rousseff, the former president of Brazil and an ally of her administration, who was impeached this year.\nMrs. Kirchner was indicted in May on charges of manipulating Argentina\u2019s Central Bank to bolster the peso. She is also under investigation in several other cases, many of which include Mr. B\u00e1ez, who was detained in April in a separate case relating to money laundering. Mr. B\u00e1ez has denied all charges against him.\nOne of Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s lawyers, Gregorio Dalbon, wrote on Twitter that the latest indictment would be appealed. Mr. De Vido characterized the charges as \u201ca ruling that was made-to-measure for Macri\u2019s political needs.\u201d Trials, given the slow pace of Argentina\u2019s justice system, would most likely be a long way off.\nThe indictments were announced a day after Mr. Macri fired the finance minister, Alfonso Prat-Gay, in what was the first cabinet shake-up since he took office last year in the midst of a deep recession. The economy has taken longer to recover than he promised; economic activity plunged 4.7 percent in October, compared to the previous year, according to official figures released on Tuesday.\nSome analysts say the latest indictment could help Mr. Macri\u2019s center-right government make its case, even if implicitly, that it needs more time to revive the economy.\n\u201cIn the context of a weak economy, the government needs to remind voters of who came before them and the inheritance they received,\u201d said Marcelo Bermol\u00e9n, a political science professor at Universidad Austral in Buenos Aires. \u201cMuch of the strength of the government lies\u201d in keeping Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s profile alive so it will have someone to blame.\nThe corruption allegations swirling around Mrs. Kirchner and her circle have provoked resentment among a public still smarting from the recession. In perhaps the most lurid episode, Mr. L\u00f3pez was caught in June at a convent outside Buenos Aires with a semiautomatic rifle, expensive watches and nearly $9 million in cash. Still, some observers suggest that the new indictment might actually bolster her support among the approximately 36 percent of the population that continues to have a positive image of the former president.\n\u201cThis could be useful for her in terms of victimization, which she is already doing,\u201d said Sergio Berensztein, a political analyst.\nMr. Berensztein added, however, that history was ultimately not on Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s side: \u201cEx-presidents in Argentina have not been really successful in regaining power once they leave office.\u201d", "date": "Dec. 27, 2016", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/27/world/americas/argentina-cristina-fernandez-kirchner-mauricio-macri.html", "tags": "fern\u00e1ndez \u201c kirchner corruption indictment de former charges indicted mrs. cristina"}
