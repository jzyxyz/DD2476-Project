{"title": "The Big New Idea For Reducing Health Care Costs Is Actually Really Old", "content": "If you think the country needs dramatic, even radical action to stop medical care from getting so expensive, pay close attention to what\u2019s happening in California.\nNext week, a committee in the state Assembly will vote on legislation\u00a0to create a permanent, nine-member commission on health care costs, quality and access. But instead of simply proposing different ways of paying for medical care, like so many other commissions have over the years, this one would have real power \u2015 the power to set legally binding limits on what hospitals, drugmakers and the rest of the health care industry can charge private insurers and individuals.\nThe bill could bring government control of health care spending to the biggest state in the country, and it might not stop there. \nGovernment control of health care spending, in one form or another, is an essential ingredient of many national reform schemes, including the \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan that Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has long championed. The idea of government-regulated prices, even as a stand-alone reform, has recently gotten favorable attention in the pages of The American Prospect and Washington Monthly, two publications that serve as policy incubators for liberals in Washington, D.C.\nTo be clear, the short-term political prospects for California\u2019s bill are mixed at best. But a huge fight over it is already underway, with proponents saying that only government has the power to get health care spending under control and opponents warning about disruption, facility closures and long waits for treatment.\nIt\u2019s a preview of a debate that could play out nationally very soon and is arguably long overdue. \nThe idea of using the brute force of government to hold down health care spending is hardly new. The majority of states once had mechanisms for setting hospital fees, and the health care plan President Bill Clinton tried to pass in the 1990s even envisioned an overall cap on national health spending. \nBut the concept has largely fallen out of fashion in the last few decades. One reason was a genuine belief among a wide variety of experts, representing viewpoints from the political right to the center-left, that freer competition \u2015 among both the providers and producers of care, as well as the insurers paying for it \u2015 would ultimately restrain spending in ways that achieved the best combination of price and quality.\nShifts in raw political power reinforced that thinking. Starting in the 1970s, business groups started lobbying much more aggressively to roll back or eliminate rules on how they operate \u2015 winning support from some Democrats and nearly all Republicans. Most states dropped their price-setting regimes during the 1980s, when the Reagan administration was in power and making deregulation of corporate America one of its top priorities.\nBut that consensus seems to be eroding now. Thanks in part to reporting by journalists like Steven Brill, Sarah Kliff, and Elizabeth Rosenthal, patience with the high and wildly inconsistent prices of medical care in the U.S. has worn thin, even among jaded experts. In California, hospitals charge anywhere from $1,529 to $182,955 for an appendectomy, according to one study that appeared in the Annals of Internal Medicine in 2012.\nDisappointment and frustration with the Affordable Care Act is part of the story too. The law\u2019s architects wanted to \u201cbend the curve\u201d on health care spending \u2015 not through a government takeover, as critics charged, but with financial incentives designed to reward efficiency. An example was a penalty, within Medicare, for hospitals with high rates of costly and preventable readmissions. \nAlthough some of these efforts appear to be working, some don\u2019t. Even the most promising ones are going to make only a modest impact, as even the law\u2019s supporters have long conceded. \nMeanwhile, just as politics were shifting to the right toward the end of the 20th century, they may be shifting back left now,\u00a0at least within the Democratic Party, where the appeal of Medicare for All was arguably a major reason Sanders came as close as he did to winning the 2016 nomination. \nBack in September, nearly every Democratic senator\u00a0thought to be contemplating a 2020 run for the presidency endorsed the most recent iteration of his proposal. Since then, the Center for American Progress, a think tank closely aligned with the Democratic Party\u2019s establishment, has introduced its own plan to enroll large numbers of Americans in a version of Medicare. That plan also envisions using government pressure to bring down prices.\nThe easiest defense of this approach comes from overseas. In nearly every other developed country, government holds down health care spending through some combination of setting overall budgets and then fixing individual fees.\nGermany relies more heavily on negotiations between the government and industry groups; Japan relies more on data to establish fees. The end result is always the same: Much lower spending. And it\u2019s not like those countries end up with terrible health care. On the contrary, many of them outperform the U.S. on access and quality, according to the best available data.\n\u201cThey are very pleased with their systems and they have better access than we do,\u201d Gerard Anderson, a health policy professor at Johns Hopkins University and a widely cited authority on health care systems abroad, told HuffPost.\nThe giant, essential caveat, as Anderson is quick to note, is that those countries have different medical and political cultures. The negotiations over health care prices in Germany, for example, look a lot like the cooperative, sectorwide negotiations between business and labor unions that also take place there. No such environment exists in the U.S., and it\u2019s not clear how negotiations over health care prices here would proceed.\nA more useful example may come from here in the U.S. \u2015 specifically, Maryland, the one state that held on to its hospital pricing system even as the rest of the states dropped theirs. For a long time, hospitals made up for fixed fees by simply churning through more patients. In 2010, Maryland officials upgraded their system by giving each hospital or hospital system an overall budget. \nA commission comes up with the budgets and updates them each year, using a formula that accounts for factors such as how much revenue the hospitals get already and whether their patient mix has changed for one reason or another. The commission also watches quality measures, to make sure hospitals haven\u2019t been economizing in ways that would hurt patients. \nIt will take more time\u00a0and more research\u00a0to know for sure what effect the initiative is having, as Austin Frakt noted recently in The New York Times. One recently published recently published study\u00a0did not find significant evidence of savings. But it focused on the program\u2019s early years, when it applied only to a small group of rural counties. Another study\u00a0that included more recent data, when the program had expanded to the rest of the state,\u00a0determined the savings were real.\u00a0\nHospitals, for their part, have complained about tighter budgets.\u00a0But overall their finances haven\u2019t deteriorated, according to that most recent study, and neither has quality. Some hospitals are actually trying to improve follow-up care in order to avoid costly readmissions, although it\u2019s not clear how real or big a trend that is.\nIf California\u2019s scheme were to become law, it would be both more and less ambitious than Maryland\u2019s. It would affect doctors, drugmakers and hospitals, thereby getting its hands on every major producer and provider of care. Maryland\u2019s does not, although officials there are already working to expand theirs as well. \nBut California\u2019s proposal would only address what private insurers and individual consumers with private coverage pay for care. It would not alter what Medicare or the state\u2019s Medicaid program pay for services \u2015 and, critically, it would not set an overall budget. Instead, it would simply set the private payment rates at a percentage above what Medicare pays. That omission is a nod to political reality: Setting new rates for Medicare and Medicaid would require agreement from the Trump administration, which would likely be skeptical.\nUncertainty over exactly where the commission would land on rates is one reason the state\u2019s providers are full freak-out mode. Because they rely on private insurance to make up for what they lose on Medicare and Medicaid patients, providers say, lower payments from private insurers would force them to make severe cutbacks \u2015 the kinds that could mean hospital workers losing their jobs and patients waiting a lot longer to get care. \n\u201cIt will unravel our health care system,\u201d Jan Emerson-Shea, a spokeswoman for the California Hospital Association, told HuffPost. She cited as proof the organization\u2019s in-house\u00a0estimate that the bill would suck $18 billion out of the state\u2019s health care system each year, although she declined to provide much detail on how it reached that conclusion.\nThe measure\u2019s advocates, which include prominent labor unions and other progressive organizations, call such concerns baseless. \nThe governor and the Legislature would appoint seven of the nine members, with the secretary of health and the director of California\u2019s public employee benefits program taking the other two spots.\u00a0That introduces accountability, advocates say,\u00a0because elected officials are not going to appoint members who would cut spending irresponsibly. Besides, advocates say,\u00a0providers would have the right to appeal for higher rates if they don\u2019t like the commission\u2019s decisions.\u00a0\nNot that advocates are ready to concede much. They very much want to clamp down on what they see as profiteering, especially by hospital systems with local monopolies. Their favorite example is Sutter Health Care, the hospital network now facing a state lawsuit over allegedly anti-competitive practices that have driven up prices in Northern California. Sutter says it has engaged in no such behavior.\u00a0\n\u201cWe have a system where the price of health care is unrelated to the cost of providing it, or outcomes, but rather to the relative power of hospitals and medical groups in the region,\u201d said Anthony Wright, executive director of Health Access, a consumer advocacy organization that is one of the bill\u2019s major supporters.\nA national debate over government regulation of health care spending, as part of a single-payer proposal or simply on its own, would likely spark similar arguments. It would also raise questions about money for research \u2015 specifically, whether having government dictating so many fees could stunt innovation or at least steer it in the wrong direction.\nThe potential effects on innovation are particularly worrisome to some economists who fear that the impact might not be apparent for many years, if at all, making it impossible to undo before the damage sets in. \u201cPeople don\u2019t think enough about that long-term trade-off, because it\u2019s not readily observable \u2015 you don\u2019t see the drug that\u2019s not developed,\u201d said Craig Garthwaite, an economist at Northwestern University\u2019s Kellogg School of Management who specializes in the pharmaceutical industry.\nAdvocates respond that health care innovation in the U.S. really has more to do with government funding anyway, and that, to the extent competition drives innovation, it does so poorly. An example would be the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s focus on new drugs that don\u2019t really offer new clinical benefits, but that they can successfully promote with television advertising.\nThe key with any proposal, whether it\u2019s for setting prices or global budgets or both, is the details.\u00a0A lot depends on who is making the decisions, what criteria they use, how quickly spending levels change, and what else is happening in health policy at the same time.\u00a0\nBut the ultimate factor in whether more proposals like California\u2019s go forward, at either the state or federal level, may be just how exasperated Americans have become with rising costs. If the frustration is high enough, they may be ready for some dramatic changes.", "date": "\n04/20/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/california-health-care-price-control_n_5ad66dcde4b0e4d0715b21d8", "tags": "really costs spending big idea reducing one \u2015 california old actually hospitals state new government care health"}
