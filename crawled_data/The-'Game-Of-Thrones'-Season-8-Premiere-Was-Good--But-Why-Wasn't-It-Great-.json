{"title": "The 'Game Of Thrones' Season 8 Premiere Was Good- But Why Wasn't It Great-", "content": "Halfway through the premiere episode of the eighth and final season of \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d Jon Snow (Kit Harington) rides a dragon. It\u2019s a moment fans of the HBO show, and George R.R. Martin\u2019s \u201cA Song Of Ice and Fire\u201d book series, have been anticipating for years: Aegon Targaryen, the true heir to the Iron Throne, confidently mounts the dragon named after his father and fiercely protects Winterfell against the army of the dead.\nExcept it doesn\u2019t happen that way. In actuality,\u00a0Aegon Targaryen timidly mounts Rhaegal for a humorous glide through the northern landscape with his boo Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) and her favorite child, Drogon. It\u2019s the perfect wintertime date.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s cold up here for a southern girl,\u201d Jon tells Dany in front of an icy waterfall. \u201cSo keep your queen warm,\u201d she responds before they share an over-the-top kiss in front of their embarrassed dragons. (\u201cEw, mom,\u201d I imagine Drogon saying.)\nFor starters, this moment truly disappointed. I\u2019ve been waiting years to see Jon ride a dragon \u2015 \u201cdracarys\u201d rolling off his tongue. Instead,\u00a0at the premiere event in New York City earlier this month, I thought to myself,\u00a0\u201cAm I watching \u2018Enchanted\u2019?!\u201d The cheese was melting off the screen, and most members of the audience at Radio City Music Hall gobbled it up.\u00a0\nBut that\u2019s the goal of \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d isn\u2019t it? To entertain its mass audience. Everyone from my brother to my mom watches this show \u2015 one vigilantly looking out for clues to confirm a theory, the other half-paying attention while pouring another glass of wine. And as the seasons have gone by, surpassing the brilliance of Martin\u2019s dense novels, showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss have somehow satisfied those wine guzzlers\u2019 needs and left the perhaps overly invested viewers wanting a bit more depth.\u00a0Long gone are the sharp back-and-forths between Jaime Lannister (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) and Brienne of Tarth (Gwendoline Christie). Forgotten is the mental sparring between Arya (Maisie Williams) and Tywin Lannister (Charles Dance), or the eloquence of Tyrion\u2019s (Peter Dinklage) plea before the court of King\u2019s Landing. Slow-burning scenes are a thing of the past.\nAs someone who\u2019s obsessively watched the show since the first season aired in 2011, my expectations for the Season 8 debut were high. After waiting nearly two years for new episodes, and parsing through every theory I could find, I was convinced David and Dan would not let me down: The final season\u2019s premiere would be iconic and would surely call back to the gripping scenes that started it all.\n\u201cWinter Is Coming,\u201d the pilot episode, featured an opening scene that left me shivering with fear, and excitement. While one brother of the Night\u2019s Watch patrols the outskirts of the Wall, he finds a bevy of frozen, dead Wildlings \u2015 their severed body parts forming a symbol. When he brings his companions back to the gravesite, the bodies are mysteriously gone and a pair of blue eyes appear behind them \u2015 blue eyes we now know belong to the undead,\u00a0a White Walker. Ramin Djawadi\u2019s theme song kicks in as the opening credits begin. Before long we\u2019re introduced to the Stark boys \u2015 Jon (Harington), Robb (Richard Madden), Bran (Isaac Hempstead Wright) and Rickon (Art Parkinson) \u2015 who are practicing their archery skills in front of their parents, Ned (Sean Bean) and Catelyn (Michelle Fairley). Then we meet their sisters Sansa (Sophie Turner) and Arya (Williams) \u2015 the former a talented needlepointer, the latter a natural assassin.\u00a0\nThe Season 8 premiere, however, had no creepy opening, despite the oncoming threat of the Night King.\u00a0We\u2019re immediately thrust into Winterfell as we witness the arrival of power couple-in-love Jon and Dany. We see reunion after reunion (after reunion), all of which happen as fast as you can say, \u201cWow, Gendry\u2019s a fantastic runner.\u201d We see Cersei (Lena Headey) impulsively let Euron (Pilou Asb\u00e6k) into her bed, Theon (Alfie Allen) rescue Yara (Gemma Whelan) with no issues, and Sam (John Bradley) get oddly weepy about the fiery death of his asshole dad, Randyll Tarly (James Faulkner), and standoffish brother, Dickon (Tom Hopper).\nInstead of building up the ominous energy ahead of the Great War, the premiere was much more lighthearted than expected, with Tyrion continuing to joke about Varys\u2019 (Conleth Hill) lack of balls to Arya poking fun at the Hound (Rory McCann) and flirting with Gendry (Joe Dempsie). The only person who is concerned about the army of the dead is Sansa, who is trying to band the North together after Jon betrayed their trust and bent the knee to the dragon queen. She seems to be the only one with her head in the game, even outsmarting Tyrion during their long-awaited, post Purple Wedding meet-up.\u00a0\n\u201cI used to think you were the cleverest man alive,\u201d she tells him. (Same, Sansa.)\nIt\u2019s not the story but the writing that\u2019s gotten a bit fan service-y. Although Martin has consulted with the team, since Season 5 the HBO series has functioned without his books. (Books he promises to finish.) Like we saw with Season 7, the dialogue is now seemingly aimed at making viewers chuckle instead of analyze. Take \u201cBeyond the Wall,\u201d for example, when Tormund (Kristofer Hivju)\u00a0and the Hound are making small talk.\u00a0Or Ed Sheeran\u2019s cringey cameo in the Season 7 premiere. Moments like these, as \u201cfun\u201d as they are, only make the rushed final seasons feel slightly uninspired.\u00a0\nThis is \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d though, and, partly due to its sizable budget, it never fails to impress. There are a handful of moments in the Season 8 premiere that live up to expectations: Sam (John Bradley) telling Jon about his true parentage, Beric (Richard Dormer) and Tormund discovering a new Night King symbol,\u00a0Bran coming face-to-face with Jaime Lannister. Those scenes were incredibly satisfying and set up significant storylines for the end of the show.\nBut my mind still floats back to that fanciful dragon scene, something I\u2019ll never forget for all the wrong reasons.\u00a0\n\u201cWe could stay here for a thousand years and no one could find us,\u201d Dany tells Jon in a moment reminiscent of a certain cave rendezvous with his first love \u2015 foul-mouthed Wildling Ygritte (Rose Leslie).\u00a0\nThe lovey-dovey stuff worked then, but with the undead now marching south, let\u2019s leave the cheap tricks at the door. (But, like, hold the door, because I\u2019m still coming in.)\u00a0\u00a0", "date": "\n04/14/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/game-of-thrones-season-8-episode-1_n_5caf5976e4b0308735d62a53", "tags": "great- game dragon premiere show season \u201d good- \u2015 jon years thrones"}
