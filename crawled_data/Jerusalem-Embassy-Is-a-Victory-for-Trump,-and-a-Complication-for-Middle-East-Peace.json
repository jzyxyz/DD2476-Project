{"title": "Jerusalem Embassy Is a Victory for Trump, and a Complication for Middle East Peace", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump and senior members of his administration exulted on Monday over the opening of the United States\u2019 new embassy in Jerusalem, dismissing the violence raging along the border with Gaza as the ceremony unfolded as \u201cunfortunate propaganda.\u201d\nFor Mr. Trump, the opening of the embassy was an opportunity to keep a campaign promise, and was yet another example of his willingness to upend decades of conventional thinking on foreign policy and to do what other American presidents had not dared. But the split-screen image of the carnage nearby was a sobering reminder that what Mr. Trump is claiming as a foreign policy coup has only complicated the prospects for the Middle East peace the president has said he is seeking.\nThe White House said the violence in Gaza would not hinder its efforts to seek an end to the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians, but the administration also made it abundantly clear on Monday that Mr. Trump was currently siding with Israel.\n\u201cThe responsibility for these tragic deaths rest squarely with Hamas,\u201d said Raj Shah, a White House deputy press secretary, who referred to Gaza as \u201csouthern Israel.\u201d \u201cHamas is intentionally and cynically provoking this response, and as the secretary of state said, Israel has the right to defend itself.\u201d\nAsked whether the White House was urging restraint by the Israelis, Mr. Shah again blamed Hamas, a Sunni militant group. \u201cThis is a gruesome and unfortunate propaganda attempt,\u201d he said.\nThe violence threatened to overshadow an otherwise triumphant day for Mr. Trump, coming as Israel is celebrating the 70th anniversary of its independence, an occasion marked by Palestinians as the \u201cnakba,\u201d or \u201ccatastrophe,\u201d in which hundreds of thousands of them fled or were expelled from their homes.\n\u201cFor many years, we failed to acknowledge the obvious, the plain reality that Israel\u2019s capital is Jerusalem,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a video message recorded for the embassy\u2019s opening ceremony. \u201cWe extend a hand in friendship to Israel, the Palestinians and to all of their neighbors. May there be peace.\u201d\nLater, at a reception hosted by the Israeli Embassy in Washington to celebrate the 70th anniversary, Vice President Mike Pence portrayed the embassy opening as proof of Mr. Trump\u2019s steadfast commitment to Israel.\n\u201cBy finally recognizing Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, the United States has recognized fact over fiction,\u201d Mr. Pence said. He recited the words of the shehecheyanu, a Jewish prayer of thank for special occasions, and used a Yiddish congratulatory phrase, saying, \u201cOn this big day for Israel, we say mazel tov!\u201d\nLawmakers in both parties praised the embassy move, which pointed up a rare bit of common ground between the president and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, who called it \u201clong overdue\u201d and applauded Mr. Trump for making it.\nBut barely 40 miles from the festivities in Jerusalem, mass protests that erupted six weeks ago raged anew, smoke rising into the air as more than 2,000 people were injured and the death toll climbed beyond 50. The violence drew international rebukes. Turkey pulled its ambassadors from Israel and Washington, and South Africa withdrew its envoys from Israel. France called on Israel to exercise restraint.\n\u201cThere is an urgent need to recreate the conditions needed to find a political solution in a regional context already marked by heightened tensions,\u201d Jean-Yves Le Drian, the French foreign minister, said in a statement in which he repeated France\u2019s disapproval of the embassy move.\nMr. Trump\u2019s advisers are said to be close to finishing a much-anticipated plan for forging peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians, but they have been deliberating for weeks on the best way to present it. Monday\u2019s striking contrasting images \u2014 pristinely dressed Israelis and Americans applauding joyfully at the new embassy in Jerusalem while Israeli soldiers fired bullets and tear gas at throngs of Palestinian protesters in Gaza \u2014 encapsulated the difficulty of their task.\nThe Palestinians were enraged about Mr. Trump\u2019s decision in December to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and have since refused to negotiate with his administration over potential terms for an end to the long-running conflict. They argue that in recognizing Jerusalem and moving quickly to relocate the American Embassy there from Tel Aviv, the United States has shown itself to be an unreliable broker for peace, and has forfeited its role as a credible mediator.\nOn Monday, Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, whom he entrusted with ending the Middle East conflict, argued that moving the embassy to Jerusalem was not an abandonment of the peace process, but a precursor to it. He made only glancing reference to the bloodshed.\n\u201cAs we have seen from the protests of the last few months and even today, those provoking violence are part of the problem and not part of the solution,\u201d Mr. Kushner said. \u201cWhen there is peace in this region, we will look back upon this day and remember that the journey to peace started with a strong America recognizing the truth.\u201d\nMr. Kushner nodded to the challenges of forging a peace agreement, saying that \u201cit will not be an easy road, and it will be filled with difficult moments and tough decisions.\u201d But dismissed the problems neatly: \u201cIf we dream big, if we lead with courage, we can change the trajectory for millions from hopeless to boundless.\u201d\nBut many analysts now believe that Mr. Kushner\u2019s plan \u2014 drawn up with David M. Friedman, Mr. Trump\u2019s envoy to Israel, and Jason D. Greenblatt, his top international negotiator \u2014 has even less chance of advancing than it once did.\nAaron David Miller, a vice president at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars who has advised Democratic and Republican presidents on the Middle East, said that while he once viewed forging a peace deal in the Middle East as \u201cmission impossible,\u201d on Monday it became \u201cmission impossible on steroids.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019ve hyped up the anxiety, the frustration and the obsession with Jerusalem, ensuring that Jerusalem becomes the bellwether of whether this peace plan flies or not,\u201d Mr. Miller said of Mr. Trump and his advisers. \u201cInstead of taking Jerusalem off the table, they have made Jerusalem the table.\u201d\nAdministration allies argued instead that moving the embassy and recognizing Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital could have a positive effect on the prospects for peace, essentially forcing the Palestinians back to the negotiating table.\n\u201cThe long-delayed, symbolic move addresses a historic injustice: Israel is the only country in the world not allowed to choose its own capital,\u201d said Jim Phillips, a senior research fellow for Middle Eastern affairs at the conservative Heritage Foundation. He said the step \u201ccould have a positive impact in the long run if it shocks Palestinian and other Arab leaders into recognizing that the longer they wait to genuinely accept Israel\u2019s existence and sign a peace treaty, the less they can expect to gain from such a treaty.\u201d\nOn Monday, such an agreement remained a long-off hypothetical. Mr. Shah said that the Trump plans for resolving the conflict would be released at an \u201cappropriate time.\u201d For now, the administration\u2019s diplomatic focus is elsewhere, preparing for historic denuclearization talks between Mr. Trump and Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea.\n\u201cWhat today is about is following through on what the president promised and believes,\u201d Mr. Shah said. \u201cWe\u2019ve, for decades, walked on eggshells, pretending that Jerusalem isn\u2019t the capital of Israel, when it obviously is.\u201d", "date": "May 14, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/14/us/politics/trump-jerusalem-embassy-middle-east-peace.html", "tags": "victory middle peace complication trump embassy \u201d israel jerusalem east"}
