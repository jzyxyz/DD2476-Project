{"title": "Rashida Tlaib Lambastes GOP Lawmakers For \u2018Twisting\u2019 Her Comments About The Holocaust", "content": "Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) is pushing back against Republican lawmakers and accusing them of twisting her words to push a \u201cracist and hateful agenda.\u201d\nTlaib, who in January became the first Palestinian-American woman in Congress, spoke about the Holocaust and the Palestinian-Israeli conflict during an interview with Yahoo News\u2019 \u201cSkullduggery\u201d podcast on Sunday. When asked to elaborate on her support for a one-state solution to the Palestinian-Israeli struggle, Tlaib mentioned the recent commemoration of Holocaust Remembrance Day in the U.S., then explained how and why she felt \u201chumbled\u201d that her ancestors had created \u201ca safe haven\u201d for the Jewish people.\u00a0\nTlaib said:\nTlaib also criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his party for \u201cgiving up\u201d on the two-state option.\nIsraeli news outlets like Haaretz covered Tlaib\u2019s comments on the one-state issue and highlighted the congresswoman\u2019s assertion that Palestinians had created a \u201csafe haven\u201d for Jews.\u00a0Seth Frantz, editor of\u00a0The Jerusalem Post, wrote in an op-ed\u00a0that Tlaib had \u201cturned history on its head\u201d with that claim.\nGOP House lawmakers, however,\u00a0chose to jump on Tlaib\u2019s use of the words \u201ccalming feeling\u201d and falsely suggested that she had used the phrase to describe how she feels about the Holocaust itself.\nRep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) claimed Tlaib had said \u201cthinking of the Holocaust provides her a \u2018calming feeling.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cAll of us, regardless of party, must stand as Americans against the evil of anti-Semitism. If the Democratic leadership continues to stand by in silence, they are enabling the spread of evil,\u201d Cheney said in a statement.\nHouse Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) echoed this sentiment.\n\u201cThere is no justification for the twisted and disgusting comments made by Rashida Tlaib just days after the annual Day of Holocaust Remembrance,\u201d Scalise said in a statement, according to The Washington Post. \u201cMore than 6 million Jews were murdered during the Holocaust; there is nothing \u2018calming\u2019 about that fact.\u201d\nFox News\u00a0initially parroted this angle, publishing a story on Sunday with the headline:\nThe conservative outlet later removed the reference to the phrase in its headline, saying only that Tlaib was criticized for her \u201ccomments on Holocaust, Palestinians.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nIn a tweet, Tlaib accused Republicans of twisting her words:\n\u201cRepublican leaders and right-wing extremists are spreading outright lies to incite hate,\u201d Denzel McCampbell, Tlaib\u2019s spokesman, told the Post in a statement. \u201cCongresswoman Liz Cheney should be ashamed of herself for using the tragedy of the Holocaust in a transparent attempt to score political points. Her behavior cheapens our public discourse and is an insult to the Jewish community and the millions of Americans who stand opposed to the hatred being spread by Donald Trump\u2019s Republican Party.\u201d\nMcCampbell added that Tlaib \u201cdid not in any way praise the Holocaust\u201d and had \u201crepeatedly called the Holocaust a tragedy and a horrific persecution of Jewish people.\u201d", "date": "\n05/13/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/rashida-tlaib-holocaust-israel-palestine_n_5cd8de9ce4b054da4e8bab52?upp", "tags": "tlaib rashida \u2018 news holocaust twisting words gop \u201d republican lambastes comments lawmakers jewish"}
