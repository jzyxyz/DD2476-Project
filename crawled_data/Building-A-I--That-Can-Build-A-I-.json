{"title": "Building A.I. That Can Build A.I.", "content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 They are a dream of researchers but perhaps a nightmare for highly skilled computer programmers: artificially intelligent machines that can build other artificially intelligent machines.\nWith recent speeches in both Silicon Valley and China, Jeff Dean, one of Google\u2019s leading engineers, spotlighted a Google project called AutoML. ML is short for machine learning, referring to computer algorithms that can learn to perform particular tasks on their own by analyzing data. AutoML, in turn, is a machine-learning algorithm that learns to build other machine-learning algorithms.\nWith it, Google may soon find a way to create A.I. technology that can partly take the humans out of building the A.I. systems that many believe are the future of the technology industry.\nThe project is part of a much larger effort to bring the latest and greatest A.I. techniques to a wider collection of companies and software developers.\nThe tech industry is promising everything from smartphone apps that can recognize faces to cars that can drive on their own. But by some estimates, only 10,000 people worldwide have the education, experience and talent needed to build the complex and sometimes mysterious mathematical algorithms that will drive this new breed of artificial intelligence.\nThe world\u2019s largest tech businesses, including Google, Facebook and Microsoft, sometimes pay millions of dollars a year to A.I. experts, effectively cornering the market for this hard-to-find talent. The shortage isn\u2019t going away anytime soon, just because mastering these skills takes years of work.\nThe industry is not willing to wait. Companies are developing all sorts of tools that will make it easier for any operation to build its own A.I. software, including things like image and speech recognition services and online chatbots.\n\u201cWe are following the same path that computer science has followed with every new type of technology,\u201d said Joseph Sirosh, a vice president at Microsoft, which recently unveiled a tool to help coders build deep neural networks, a type of computer algorithm that is driving much of the recent progress in the A.I. field. \u201cWe are eliminating a lot of the heavy lifting.\u201d\nThis is not altruism. Researchers like Mr. Dean believe that if more people and companies are working on artificial intelligence, it will propel their own research. At the same time, companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft see serious money in the trend that Mr. Sirosh described. All of them are selling cloud-computing services that can help other businesses and developers build A.I.\n\u201cThere is real demand for this,\u201d said Matt Scott, a co-founder and the chief technical officer of Malong, a start-up in China that offers similar services. \u201cAnd the tools are not yet satisfying all the demand.\u201d\nThis is most likely what Google has in mind for AutoML, as the company continues to hail the project\u2019s progress. Google\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, boasted about AutoML last month while unveiling a new Android smartphone.\nEventually, the Google project will help companies build systems with artificial intelligence even if they don\u2019t have extensive expertise, Mr. Dean said. Today, he estimated, no more than a few thousand companies have the right talent for building A.I., but many more have the necessary data.\n\u201cWe want to go from thousands of organizations solving machine learning problems to millions,\u201d he said.\nGoogle is investing heavily in cloud-computing services \u2014 services that help other businesses build and run software \u2014 which it expects to be one of its primary economic engines in the years to come. And after snapping up such a large portion of the world\u2019s top A.I researchers, it has a means of jump-starting this engine.\nNeural networks are rapidly accelerating the development of A.I. Rather than building an image-recognition service or a language translation app by hand, one line of code at a time, engineers can much more quickly build an algorithm that learns tasks on its own.\nBy analyzing the sounds in a vast collection of old technical support calls, for instance, a machine-learning algorithm can learn to recognize spoken words.\nBut building a neural network is not like building a website or some run-of-the-mill smartphone app. It requires significant math skills, extreme trial and error, and a fair amount of intuition. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Gagn\u00e9, the chief executive of an independent machine-learning lab called Element AI, refers to the process as \u201ca new kind of computer programming.\u201d\nIn building a neural network, researchers run dozens or even hundreds of experiments across a vast network of machines, testing how well an algorithm can learn a task like recognizing an image or translating from one language to another. Then they adjust particular parts of the algorithm over and over again, until they settle on something that works. Some call it a \u201cdark art,\u201d just because researchers find it difficult to explain why they make particular adjustments.\nBut with AutoML, Google is trying to automate this process. It is building algorithms that analyze the development of other algorithms, learning which methods are successful and which are not. Eventually, they learn to build more effective machine learning. Google said AutoML could now build algorithms that, in some cases, identified objects in photos more accurately than services built solely by human experts.\nBarret Zoph, one of the Google researchers behind the project, believes that the same method will eventually work well for other tasks, like speech recognition or machine translation.\nThis is not always an easy thing to wrap your head around. But it is part of a significant trend in A.I. research. Experts call it \u201clearning to learn\u201d or \u201cmeta-learning.\u201d\nMany believe such methods will significantly accelerate the progress of A.I. in both the online and physical worlds. At the University of California, Berkeley, researchers are building techniques that could allow robots to learn new tasks based on what they have learned in the past.\n\u201cComputers are going to invent the algorithms for us, essentially,\u201d said a Berkeley professor, Pieter Abbeel. \u201cAlgorithms invented by computers can solve many, many problems very quickly \u2014 at least that is the hope.\u201d\nThis is also a way of expanding the number of people and businesses that can build artificial intelligence. These methods will not replace A.I. researchers entirely. Experts, like those at Google, must still do much of the important design work. But the belief is that the work of a few experts can help many others build their own software.\nRenato Negrinho, a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University who is exploring technology similar to AutoML, said this was not a reality today but should be in the years to come. \u201cIt is just a matter of when,\u201d he said.", "date": "Nov. 5, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/05/technology/machine-learning-artificial-intelligence-ai.html", "tags": "automl building algorithms a.i \u201d build researchers google"}
