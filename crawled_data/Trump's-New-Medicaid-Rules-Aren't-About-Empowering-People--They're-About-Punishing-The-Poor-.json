{"title": "Trump's New Medicaid Rules Aren't About Empowering People- They're About Punishing The Poor-", "content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has provided states with a new weapon to exact revenge on lazy poor people who have the temerity to be on the losing end of the American economy and also sometimes need to go to the doctor.\nFor the first time in the five-decade history of the Medicaid program, the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will permit states to impose work requirements\u00a0on Medicaid beneficiaries. The agency issued new guidance to states on Thursday on how to win federal approval for this restriction on Medicaid eligibility.\nThe vast majority of able-bodied, adult Medicaid recipients are in families where at least one adult is working and qualify for the program because they have low-paying jobs that may not even offer health benefits, let alone insurance these workers can afford.\nAnd never mind that there are a lot of good, sometimes unavoidable reasons why even a part-time job isn\u2019t an option for people who, say, have chronic illnesses not severe enough to constitute a disability; or who are caring for an ill or elderly relative; or who are full-time parents; or who are enrolled in school. \nAnd the next time the unemployment rate spikes and people find themselves out of work and uninsured, these work requirements are going to make it even harder for them to keep their lives together.\nThe policy the Trump administration is enacting are based not on data but on an ugly stereotype many Americans hold about people who rely on Medicaid and other programs to get by.\u00a0Accordingly, 70 percent of Americans said they supported work requirements in Medicaid in a survey the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation conducted in June.\nImagine Ronald Reagan\u2019s \u201cwelfare queen,\u201d only this time she has diabetes and can\u2019t be on her feet all day. The Trump administration\u2019s solution to this woman\u2019s problems is to make it harder for her to see a doctor and fill her prescriptions, so she gets sicker and is less likely to find steady work.\nThe Trump administration and Republicans supportive of work requirements for Medicaid enrollees portray this policy as benevolent, as a means of elevating people to the higher status of not being poor, as though being poor doesn\u2019t create its own incentives to not be poor. Who would turn down a high-paying job with good health insurance if that were actually an option for them?\nHere\u2019s Seema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicaid and Medicaid Services, promoting the new policy:\nThat sounds lovely. But the more likely result will be people kicked off their health benefits and more people who don\u2019t bother signing up because they don\u2019t think they\u2019ll be able to get them. In essence, some untold number of people will become less healthy and more financially vulnerable so that others who resent the \u201clazy\u201d can feel even more superior to them.\nIt can scarcely be emphasized strongly enough that work requirements are a solution largely in search of a problem (unless the \u201cproblem\u201d is that safety net programs exist at all, which is how a lot of people see it). \nAt best,\u00a0the new Medicaid policy reveals an ethos that accepts denying help to many people if that\u2019s the price of denying it to a single person who\u2019s exploiting the system. There is no doubt such people exist, but policies like these put the burden of proof on everyone else to demonstrate they\u2019re not idle fraudsters. They also assume the opposite of the truth, which is that most people who need help are shiftless.\nAccording to data compiled by the Kaiser Family Foundation, about 25 million adults without disabilities have Medicaid coverage. Among those, 60 percent have jobs and 79 percent are in families with at least one worker. More than six in 10 of these families include at least one adult who works full-time.\nThese individuals are poor by any measure, including those who are employed. \nIn states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, adults earning up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level \u2015 just a little over $16,000 a year for a single person \u2015 qualify. Thirty-one states and the District of Columbia participate in the Medicaid expansion, and Maine is in the processing of implementing it.\nIn non-expansion states, adults who don\u2019t have a disability and aren\u2019t parents generally can\u2019t enroll in Medicaid no matter how little they earn. Parents of poor children in some non-expansion states don\u2019t qualify if they make more than half the poverty level, while others range from half all the way up to 133 percent.\nLarge portions of the Medicaid population would be exempt from the work requirements under the new federal policy, mainly children, pregnant women, the elderly and people with disabilities. In addition, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services advised states to make accommodations for people deemed medically frail and those under treatment for opioid addiction or other substance-abuse problems.\nIn addition, the agency offers a fairly broad array of activities that would satisfy the work requirement. Enrollees can demonstrate, for example, that they have a job, are searching for work, are in a job training program, are committing time to volunteering, or are a full-time caregiver.\nAll of that, if implemented the way the administration says it wants it to be, would be more humane than not doing those things. \nBut those exceptions, exemptions and accommodations would have the effect of making the population of those who really aren\u2019t working when they could be quite small, calling into question the point of doing any of this.\nPlus, everyone not explicitly excluded from work requirements will have to prove that they\u2019re in compliance. That means people who have jobs will have to prove it at regular intervals, and so will some people who are exempt for other reasons. That\u2019s a lot of hassle, and that kind of hassle tends to suppress enrollment.\nOther federal benefit programs have work requirements, including Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (also known as SNAP or food stamps) and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (also known as TANF or welfare). Research shows that TANF\u2019s work requirement hasn\u2019t made recipients more likely to work or elevated them from poverty.\nSo the consequences of this new Medicaid policy are likely to be fewer people with health coverage and not very many people with new or better jobs, or with more money. \nAnd it\u2019s going to cost states a considerable amount to set up systems to monitor whether Medicaid beneficiaries are complying with new rules about employment or other activities. States that take up work requirements will be betting that enough people lose health coverage that taxpayers will save money on net.\nPrior to Thursday\u2019s announcement, Arizona, Arkansas, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah and Wisconsin had already requested federal approval for work requirements, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. South Carolina soon will join them, and others are likely to follow. \nKentucky\u2019s application \u2015 which goes far beyond work requirements \u2015 may be approved as soon as Friday, The Washington Post reported.\nSeveral states asked President Barack Obama\u2019s administration to okay work requirements as part of expanding Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act. But the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services rejected those proposals, saying they violated the laws that govern Medicaid. \nAnd they might: Court fights are almost guaranteed once the federal government starts allowing states to implement work requirements.", "date": "\n01/11/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-medicaid-punishing-the-poor_n_5a57d85ae4b04df054f75661", "tags": "policy people- administration work poor medicaid states trump federal empowering requirements poor- new punishing rules"}
