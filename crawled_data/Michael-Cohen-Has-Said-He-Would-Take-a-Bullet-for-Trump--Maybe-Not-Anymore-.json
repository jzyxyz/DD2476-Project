{"title": "Michael Cohen Has Said He Would Take a Bullet for Trump. Maybe Not Anymore.", "content": "For years, a joke among Trump Tower employees was that the boss was like Manhattan\u2019s First Avenue, where the traffic goes only one way.\nThat one-sidedness has always been at the heart of President Trump\u2019s relationship with his longtime lawyer and fixer, Michael D. Cohen, who has said he would \u201ctake a bullet\u201d for Mr. Trump. For years Mr. Trump treated Mr. Cohen poorly, with gratuitous insults, dismissive statements and, at least twice, threats of being fired, according to interviews with a half-dozen people familiar with their relationship.\n\u201cDonald goes out of his way to treat him like garbage,\u201d said Roger J. Stone Jr., Mr. Trump\u2019s informal and longest-serving political adviser, who, along with Mr. Cohen, was one of five people originally surrounding the president when he was considering a presidential campaign before 2016.\nNow, for the first time, the traffic may be going Mr. Cohen\u2019s way. Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers and advisers have become resigned to the strong possibility that Mr. Cohen, who has a wife and two children and faces the prospect of devastating legal fees, if not criminal charges, could end up cooperating with federal officials who are investigating him for activity that could relate, at least in part, to work he did for Mr. Trump.\n[Mr. Trump on Saturday morning harshly criticized this article in a series of tweets. Read more.]\nLast week federal agents raided Mr. Cohen\u2019s office and hotel room and seized business records, emails and other material as part of what Mr. Trump has called a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d by his own Justice Department. The trove included documents dating back decades, as well as more recent ones related to a payment in 2016 to a pornographic film actress who has said she had a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump, which Mr. Trump denies.\nAlthough Mr. Trump called Mr. Cohen last Friday, four days after the raid, to \u201ccheck in,\u2019\u2019 according to people familiar with the call, he and Mr. Cohen have spoken little since Mr. Trump entered the White House. The two men did have dinner together at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump\u2019s private club in Florida, a few weeks ago, but since the raid Mr. Cohen has told associates he feels isolated.\nMr. Trump has long felt he had leverage over Mr. Cohen, but people who have worked for the president said the raid has changed all that.\n\u201cIronically, Michael now holds the leverage over Trump,\u201d said Sam Nunberg, a former aide to Mr. Trump who worked with Mr. Cohen and Mr. Stone. Mr. Nunberg said that Mr. Cohen \u201cshould maximize\u201d that leverage.\n\u201cThe softer side of the president genuinely has an affection for Michael,\u201d Mr. Nunberg said. For instance, Mr. Trump attended the bar and bat mitzvahs of Mr. Cohen\u2019s children. \u201cHowever, the president has also taken Michael for granted.\u201d Mr. Nunberg added that \u201cwhenever anyone complains to me about Trump screwing them over, my reflexive response is that person has nothing to complain about compared to Michael.\u201d\nMr. Stone recalled Mr. Trump saying of Mr. Cohen, \u201cHe owns some of the finest Trump real estate in the country \u2014 paid top dollar for it, too.\u201d In Mr. Trump\u2019s worldview, there are few insults more devastating than saying someone overpaid.\nFor years, Mr. Cohen has described himself as unflinchingly devoted to Mr. Trump, whom he has admired since high school. He has told interviewers that he has never heard Mr. Trump utter an inaccuracy or break a promise. He has tweeted about Mr. Trump nearly 3,000 times.\nIn a Fox News interview last year, Mr. Cohen declared: \u201cI will do anything to protect Mr. Trump.\u2019\u2019 He told Vanity Fair in September that \u201cI\u2019m the guy who would take a bullet for the president,\u201d adding, \u201cI\u2019d never walk away.\u201d\nAt a Republican fund-raiser at Mar-a-Lago earlier this year, Mr. Cohen went so far as to approach the first lady, Melania Trump, to try to apologize for the pain he caused her with the payment to Stephanie Clifford, known as Stormy Daniels, the adult film actress who has claimed to have had the sexual encounter with Mr. Trump.\nOver the years, Mr. Trump threatened to fire Mr. Cohen over deals that didn\u2019t work out, or snafus with business projects, people who were present for the discussions said. He was aware that Mr. Cohen benefited in other business projects as being seen as affiliated with the Trump Organization, and it irked him.\n\u201cHe clearly doesn\u2019t think that Michael Cohen is his Roy Cohn,\u201d said Tim O\u2019Brien, a Trump biographer, referring to Mr. Trump\u2019s former mentor and the president\u2019s ideal for a pit bull-like defender. \u201cI think his abusive behavior to Michael is animated by his feeling that Michael is inadequate.\u201d\nProsecutors have argued that Mr. Cohen did little actual legal work for Mr. Trump and instead focused on extensive political, media and real-estate dealings for the president.\nMichael D\u2019Antonio, another Trump biographer, recalled Mr. Cohen calling him soon before the book was published.\n\u201cHe wanted to know if I was going to call Trump a racist and he wanted to know\u201d if it would include an old allegation from Mr. Trump\u2019s wife, Ivana Trump, that he had committed marital rape, Mr. D\u2019Antonio said.\nMr. Cohen also wanted the title of the book, which was originally \u201cNever Enough,\u201d changed, Mr. D\u2019Antonio said. He recalled saying to Mr. Cohen, \u201cWhen has it ever been enough for Donald?\u201d\n\u201cAnd Cohen started laughing, and he said, \u2018I don\u2019t have a problem with the title personally,\u2019\u201d Mr. D\u2019Antonio recalled. Nonetheless, he said, Mr. Cohen said he would call the publisher to get the title changed, and then threatened a lawsuit when he couldn\u2019t.\nIn 2007, Mr. Cohen was dispatched, along with Ivanka Trump, to scout a golf course development project in Fresno, Calif., that didn\u2019t materialize. The next year, he served as chief operating officer of Affliction Entertainment, a Trump mixed-martial arts venture of boxing, wrestling and karate that featured a Russian Army veteran named Fedor Emelianenko. (\u201cHis thing is inflicting death on people,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the time.)\nHe has also scouted business opportunities for Mr. Trump in the former Soviet bloc, including a 2010 trip to Georgia on Mr. Trump\u2019s behalf.\nMr. Cohen has been active in Mr. Trump\u2019s political ventures. When Mr. Trump pondered running for president in 2012, it was Mr. Cohen who went on an early trip to Iowa to meet with Republican operatives and who set up a website called ShouldTrumpRun.org. He even initially sought to pay some of the costs for the site with money raised for his own abortive run for New York State Senate.\nMr. Trump never ran in 2012, but Mr. Cohen raised $500,000 in four hours for the Mitt Romney presidential campaign that year during one of their \u201cnational call days\u201d \u2014 and had campaign officials credit it as money that his boss had raised, one former Romney official recalled. When Mr. Trump ran for president in 2016, Mr. Cohen was given no official role on the campaign.\nHe fought with the initial campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski. Paul Manafort, the campaign chairman, later blocked him from coming on board. Mr. Trump never ordered his aides to make a place for Mr. Cohen.\nSome of Mr. Cohen\u2019s efforts to help only led to embarrassing rebuffs in front of those in charge. A month before the election, Mr. Cohen approached Mr. Trump outside his Trump Tower office with photographs of Bill Clinton and a mixed-race man alleged \u2014 without any evidence \u2014 to be the former president\u2019s illegitimate son. Mr. Trump knocked the papers away, angrily telling Mr. Cohen to \u201cget that out of my face,\u201d said one former campaign official who witnessed the incident.\nParticularly hurtful to Mr. Cohen was the way Mr. Trump lavished approval on Mr. Lewandowski in a way he never did for Mr. Cohen. When Mr. Cohen told Mr. Trump that he believed that Mr. Lewandowski had been behind a negative story about Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump dismissed the comments as simple jealousy, and didn\u2019t pay attention, according to two people familiar with the incident.\nMr. Cohen raised millions of dollars for Mr. Trump in the campaign, at a time when the candidate was struggling to attract support. Mr. Cohen tried to soften the edges as Mr. Trump faced a torrent of criticism for decades of racially divisive remarks, forming a \u201cdiversity coalition\u201d to give Mr. Trump cover composed of African-Americans, Muslims and other groups.\n\u201cNobody else around Donald Trump would have thought to do that for him,\u201d said Darrell Scott, an African-American pastor from Ohio and a friend of Mr. Cohen who helped created the coalition.", "date": "April 20, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/20/us/politics/trump-michael-cohen.html", "tags": "maybe take president would \u201d trump cohen bullet michael campaign said anymore"}
