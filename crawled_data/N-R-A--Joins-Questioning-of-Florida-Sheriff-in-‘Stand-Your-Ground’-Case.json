{"title": "N.R.A. Joins Questioning of Florida Sheriff in \u2018Stand Your Ground\u2019 Case", "content": "MIAMI \u2014 After a Florida sheriff  decided not to arrest a white man who the authorities say killed an unarmed black man in a confrontation over a handicapped parking spot, outrage came from expected places: the victim\u2019s family, civil rights organizations and Democratic politicians eager to repeal Florida\u2019s controversial self-defense law, known as Stand Your Ground.\nBut what was far more unusual was the perceived criticism from the powerful state lobbyist for the National Rifle Association, as well as Republican legislators who helped write the law. They disputed the sheriff\u2019s interpretation and implied that perhaps the gunman should have been arrested.\nFaced with increasing questions about his actions, Sheriff Bob Gualtieri of Pinellas County addressed his critics on Tuesday in a lengthy news conference, defending his decision not to arrest Michael Drejka in the shooting of Markeis McGlockton.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t get it wrong,\u201d the sheriff said.\nHis decision to let Mr. Drejka go free has reopened the debate in Florida over Stand Your Ground, a 2005 law that first rose to national attention after the 2012 fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old African-American teenager whose killer the police initially declined to arrest, citing the law.\nIn an election year already suffused with gun politics, Democrats have called for a federal investigation and traveled to Clearwater, the site of the McGlockton shooting, to rally support for legislative change.\nFlorida lawmakers have repeatedly expanded the state\u2019s far-reaching self-defense laws. Just last year, the Legislature made it easier for defendants to invoke the \u201cstand your ground\u201d protections. Instead of defendants having to prove that they were acting in self-defense, the new law shifts the burden to prosecutors, who now must prove by \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d that the use of force was not justified.\nThe legislators who created Stand Your Ground say there is nothing wrong with the law \u2014 only, perhaps, with the way in which it is being applied. But Sheriff Gualtieri, a Republican who supports the law, said on Tuesday that the law might require \u201csome changes.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s room to tweak it, to tighten it up in some areas,\u201d he said. \u201cTweaking it so that it is less ambiguous, it\u2019s clearer, and could be applied a little bit more easily than what we\u2019re having to go through here.\u201d\nIn any case, he said, he should have emphasized early on that his decision to let Mr. Drejka go free does not mean the state attorney won\u2019t eventually charge him with a crime. Deputies expect to turn over their case file to prosecutors this week.\nThe state attorney\u2019s office declined to comment on Tuesday.\nSurveillance video from the July 19 shooting shows Mr. Drejka, 47, approaching a car parked in a handicapped space outside a Circle A convenience store. He starts arguing with the woman sitting in the car \u2014 Britany Jacobs, 25, Mr. McGlockton\u2019s girlfriend \u2014 about parking without a handicap permit, according to the sheriff. Mr. McGlockton, who had been in the store, exits, approaches Mr. Drejka and pushes him to the ground. Mr. Drejka pulls out a gun. Mr. McGlockton, 28, appears to take a few steps back. Mr. Drejka shoots him once in the chest.\nMr. McGlockton\u2019s funeral on Saturday drew 250 people, including a Democratic candidate for governor. Another Democrat, Mayor Andrew Gillum of Tallahassee, the only black candidate in the governor\u2019s race, called on Gov. Rick Scott to declare a state of emergency in order to suspend the Stand Your Ground law.\n\u201cThe consequence of confusion over how Stand Your Ground is applied in this state can result in the loss of life of otherwise innocent people,\u201d Mr. Gillum said.\nThe governor, a Republican, has declined to comment on the shooting beyond expressing his condolences. His spokesman said Tuesday that Mr. Scott \u201cexpects that every Florida law be enforced and applied fairly by law enforcement and state attorneys, who are elected Floridians. If the Legislature wants to make any changes to clarify Florida\u2019s laws next legislative session, they can do so.\u201d\nSheriff Gualtieri and Bernie McCabe, the state attorney for Pinellas and Pasco counties, are listed as co-hosts for a Tuesday night fund-raiser for Mr. Scott\u2019s campaign for the United States Senate.\nSheriff Gualtieri hoped to be joined at Tuesday\u2019s news conference by representatives from the local chapter of the N.A.A.C.P. and an alliance of African-American church ministers in a show of unity that might have quelled ongoing alarm over the shooting. But the two organizations bailed on the news conference, citing a Politico report published Monday that quoted the N.R.A. and G.O.P. lawmakers disputing the sheriff\u2019s interpretation of Stand Your Ground.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very rare that the N.R.A. and the Republican lawmakers who drafted and passed Stand Your Ground tell a sheriff that his version of Stand Your Ground is not applicable in this case,\u201d Benjamin L. Crump, an attorney for Mr. McGlockton\u2019s family, told The New York Times in an interview on Tuesday. \u201cMichael Drejka should have been arrested that day, just like Markeis McGlockton would have been arrested had he pulled the trigger.\u201d\nThe unusual criticism from the gun lobby and legislators friendly to its cause came in response to several statements by the sheriff in a news conference on July 20, the day after the shooting. Sheriff Gualtieri said, among other things, that his office could be held liable in civil court for arresting a perpetrator who went on to successfully assert a Stand Your Ground defense.\nMarion Hammer, the N.R.A.\u2019s longtime Tallahassee lobbyist and a key figure in promoting Florida\u2019s emergence as a laboratory for gun-friendly legislation, said in an email to Politico that the law allows sheriffs to make arrests if they think they can prove a crime has been committed.\n\u201cNothing in either the 2005 law or the 2017 law prohibits a sheriff from making an arrest in a case where a person claims self-defense if there is probable cause that the use of force was unlawful,\u201d Ms. Hammer said, according to Politico. \u201cNothing in the law says a person can sue the sheriff for making an arrest when there is probable cause.\u201d She did not respond to a request for comment from The Times on Tuesday.\nThe sheriff had also said that the law created a \u201clargely subjective standard\u201d for how a person who felt threatened could use deadly force in self-defense. The standard is objective, said state Senator Dennis Baxley, who helped write the law when he was in the state House.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a reasonable person standard, and that means that any \u2014 any \u2014 reasonable person could look at the fact pattern and concur that he was threatened,\u201d Mr. Baxley said in an interview on Tuesday.\nSheriff Gualtieri, who has a law degree, said Tuesday that while he knows the standard is objective, \u201cThere\u2019s a subjective component.\u201d He noted that he must consider not only the surveillance video, shot from an angle to the right and behind Mr. McGlockton, but also the view from Mr. Drejka\u2019s perspective, on the ground in front of Mr. McGlockton, as well as other evidence.\nThe sheriff, who is white, dismissed any suggestion that his decision was driven by race, calling that \u201cnonsense.\u201d He pointed to two white defendants his office arrested in 2017 and 2012 who were later let go after the state attorney\u2019s office declined to prosecute based on Stand Your Ground.\nAn attorney for the 2017 defendant, a woman arrested on charges of second-degree murder in connection with the death of her abusive husband, notified the sheriff on May 15 that she intends to sue in civil court for false arrest and false imprisonment \u201cwithout sufficient probable cause.\u201d\nIn a telephone interview with The Times, the sheriff said the pending litigation did not affect his decision in the McGlockton case, and instead he has evaluated the evidence. In the parking lot confrontation, he said, Mr. Drejka appeared to have \u201cstuck his nose where it did not belong.\u201d\n\u201cDo I think that I would have shot in that situation? No,\u201d the sheriff said. \u201cBut just because I would not have, or don\u2019t believe I would have, doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s not within the boundaries of the law.\u201d", "date": "July 31, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/31/us/stand-your-ground-law-nra.html", "tags": "sheriff \u2018 ground joins mcglockton n.r.a \u201d state florida case stand questioning law said"}
