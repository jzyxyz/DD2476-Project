Mueller III was awakened at home close to 1:30 a.m. on April 19 as one suspect in the Boston Marathon bombing was in cardiac arrest and the other was on the run. \nBy 3 a.m., after an F.B.I. agent had used a fingerprint scanner on the dying suspect, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, in a hospital emergency room to learn his identity, Mr. Mueller, the F.B.I. director, had arrived in a suit and tie at his agency\u2019s headquarters in downtown Washington.\nHis agents gave him the bad news: two years earlier, the F.B.I. had interviewed, and closed its file on, Mr. Tsarnaev. Mr. Mueller took it in without showing emotion, his aides said. He turned to a deputy and ordered the release of the information \u2014 knowing it would call into question whether the F.B.I. failed to head off one of the most spectacular attacks on American soil since Sept. 11, 2001. \nNow, Mr. Mueller\u2019s 12-year tenure under two presidents is facing scrutiny, months from his longtime plans to step down in September, as hearings begin on Capitol Hill into what happened in Boston and why. \nAlthough his privileged roots and sometimes wooden personality have not made him a beloved figure in the F.B.I.\u2019s beer-and-brats culture, he has always had supporters in both parties in Congress. Now, instead of coasting into retirement, Mr. Mueller will spend his final months answering tough questions about how the bombing suspects slipped away.\nOn Thursday, Boston\u2019s police chief testified to the House Homeland Security Committee that the F.B.I. had not shared with the Boston police information it received in 2011 about Mr. Tsarnaev, or about the bureau\u2019s subsequent inquiry, which found no evidence of ties to Muslim extremists. Although the information appeared to raise questions about whether Mr. Tsarnaev would commit terrorist acts in Russia, Edward Davis, the police commissioner, said that had his department learned about the tip, \u201cwe would certainly look at the individual.\u201d He could not say whether he would have come to a different conclusion.\nFor Mr. Mueller, who took over the F.B.I. one week before the Sept. 11 attacks, the hearings stand as an unwelcome bookend to a long law enforcement career.\n\u201cIf an attack of this scale happens toward the end of your tenure and there is evidence that the F.B.I. had its hands on the people years ago and missed them, that is what people will remember,\u201d said Julian E. Zelizer, a Princeton historian and author of a book on the politics of national security.\nLee H. Hamilton, the co-chairman of the commission that investigated the Sept. 11 attacks, was blunt. \u201cHe can\u2019t avoid it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt happened, so it\u2019s part of his legacy.\u201d Mr. Mueller declined to be interviewed for this article.\nHis defenders, including President Obama, praise the bureau for its fast work in identifying Mr. Tsarnaev, 26, and his brother, Dzhokhar, 19, ethnic Chechen immigrants who the F.B.I. believes learned to make explosives from an Al Qaeda-affiliated online magazine. For days after the bombings, the F.B.I. flew its planes, including a Gulfstream 5 jet, between Boston and Washington, ferrying evidence gathered at the scene to the F.B.I.\u2019s crime laboratories for DNA analysis in a frantic effort to learn who the bombers were.\nThe break came with the fingerprint scan \u2014 technology ordinarily used to identify enemy fighters in Afghanistan \u2014 that set in motion Mr. Mueller\u2019s decision to make public the F.B.I.\u2019s previous contact with Mr. Tsarnaev. That the agency had crossed the suspect\u2019s path did not come entirely as a surprise, aides said. Inside the bureau, where F.B.I. agents under orders since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to check out the smallest terrorist tip have built databases of millions of names, the view was that it was only a matter of time before the agency would be blamed for the next attack. From the agents\u2019 perspective, the F.B.I. is vigilant, not incompetent. \u201cIn some ways, they\u2019re a victim of their own success,\u201d said Kenneth Wainstein, a former chief of staff to Mr. Mueller and former general counsel at the F.B.I.\nWhether blame is deserved or not, by 10 a.m. on April 19, Mr. Mueller had made the short trip from the F.B.I.\u2019s headquarters to the White House, where he briefed Mr. Obama in the Situation Room. Boston was on lockdown and an extensive manhunt for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was under way. Using what Benjamin J. Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser, described as a \u201cvery factual\u201d tone, Mr. Mueller did not apologize to the president for the F.B.I.\u2019s closing of Tamerlan Tsarnaev\u2019s case.\n\u201cHis view is that the F.B.I. has thousands upon thousands of leads that they investigate, and it\u2019s the nature of the business that if you don\u2019t find derogatory information about somebody in that investigation, it\u2019s just not going to trigger a detention or a deportation,\u201d Mr. Rhodes said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t defensive at all.\u201d\nBut a few days later, when Mr. Mueller briefed House members behind closed doors, one lawmaker said he seemed uncharacteristically tense. \u201cHe was ill at ease, not his normal confidence,\u201d said the congressman, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the session was classified. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t himself.\u201d\nThree days before the Boston bombings, Mr. Mueller, 68, delivered a rare and unusually personal speech at the University of Virginia, where he received his law degree 40 years ago.\n\u201cI love doing bank robberies, drug cases, homicides \u2014 as a prosecutor, that\u2019s what I thought I was going to be overseeing when I got to the bureau,\u201d he said. But, he said, Americans \u201cexpect us to prevent the next terrorist attack.\u201d\nMr. Mueller\u2019s words \u2014 which have since become, at minimum, awkward \u2014 also described his transformation of the F.B.I. He became director on Sept. 4, 2001; faced investigations into the failures to prevent the Sept. 11 plot; then set about changing the culture of the F.B.I. \u2014 56 field offices, each fiercely protective of its turf \u2014 from a domestic crime-fighting agency into a counterterrorism operation.\n\u201cIt was an enormously difficult challenge, and he went at it with great energy and skill,\u201d Mr. Hamilton said. \u201cSome agents bought into it, and others did not.\u201d\nMr. Mueller expanded the bureau\u2019s presence overseas, deployed agents to gather evidence on the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan and pressed for expanded surveillance powers. He nearly resigned over the George W. Bush administration\u2019s electronic eavesdropping program, and instructed his agents not to participate in brutal interrogation techniques used by the C.I.A. But there is no evidence that he put his objections in writing or took them to the White House.\nMr. Mueller\u2019s years at the F.B.I. \u2014 traditionally the proletarian competitor to the Ivy Leaguers at the C.I.A. \u2014 are the logical culmination of a long career spent fighting criminals, though not necessarily of his origins. Born into an affluent New York family, Mr. Mueller graduated from the elite St. Paul\u2019s School in the same 1962 class as Secretary of State John Kerry, followed his father\u2019s footsteps to Princeton, earned a master\u2019s degree in international relations from New York University, then saw combat when he led a rifle platoon in Vietnam.\nHe went on to become United States attorney in both San Francisco and Boston, and supervised cases like the prosecution of the crime boss John J. Gotti and the investigation into the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland when he ran the Justice Department\u2019s criminal division under the first President George Bush. Friends say law enforcement had always drawn him in.\n\u201cHe really hates the bad guys,\u201d said William F. Weld, the former governor of Massachusetts, who preceded Mr. Mueller as the United States attorney in Boston.\nIn recent years, friends say Mr. Mueller has grown increasingly concerned about the potential for other homegrown attacks like the one in Boston. Leon E. Panetta, the former defense secretary who ran the C.I.A. from 2009 to 2011 and who counts Mr. Mueller as a friend, said the two often talked of the changing nature of the terror threat.\n\u201cThe one area that I think we were always concerned about was the Lone Wolf Syndrome,\u201d Mr. Panetta said, using law enforcement jargon for criminals who act alone, \u201clargely because the real challenge is, how do you locate these people? How do you get ahead of it?\u201d \nIn his University of Virginia speech, Mr. Mueller said he measured success on how many attacks had occurred on American soil over the past 10 to 12 years. As he wrapped up his remarks, he offered to take questions, alluding to the skills he has developed in Washington through many a Congressional hearing, and more to come.\n\u201cI\u2019ll either answer \u2019em,\u201d he said, \u201cor duck \u2019em.\u201d", "date": "May 9, 2013", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/10/us/politics/in-bombings-a-bitter-bookend-for-robert-mueller.html", "tags": "f.b.i bombings tsarnaev f.b.i. make bookend bitter director \u201d boston one \u2014 mueller"}
