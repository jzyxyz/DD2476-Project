{"title": "'Game Of Thrones' Star Kristian Nairn Talks Coming Out And Possibly Coming Back To The Show", "content": "In a 2014 interview with WinterIsComing.net, a pseudonymous blogger by the name of Fire and Blood asked \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d actor Kristian Nairn what he thought of his \u201cbear\u201d fan following.\nThe question was,\u00a0of course, a reference to a segment of Nairn\u2019s fans who identify within the gay community as a rugged masculine type, to which the actor replied, \u201cWell, in all honesty, when you talk about \u2018the gay community,\u2019 you are talking about MY community. ... I AM aware of it,\u00a0yeah, and I think it\u2019s really lovely.\u201d\nPretty soon, outlets around the world, including CNN, were writing headlines like, \u201c\u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 Actor Comes Out As Gay.\u201d\u00a0\nNairn couldn\u2019t believe it.\n\u201cI think the comment was that I had a lot of fans in the bear community, and it was almost said like, \u2018Have you got a problem with that?\u2019\u201d Nairn explained in an interview with HuffPost earlier this month. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2019Why would I have a problem? That\u2019s my community.\u2019 And that\u2019s how I said it. It\u2019s my own community. Why would I have an issue? And that was tinder to the fire.\u201d\n\u201cIt was mind-boggling,\u201d\u00a0the actor said of the news cycle that unfolded. \u201cI mean, I\u2019ve never been \u2018in.\u2019 I\u2019ve never been straight. I\u2019ve never [lived] as a heterosexual man, and I never will unless I\u2019m struck by lightning or something. After all these years of working in the gay community all over the world ... and just to make a small comment in an interview [that] was actually just a throwaway comment. The next thing, it was like, \u2018Did you just come out?\u2019\u201d\nIn reality, everyone close to Nairn already knew. His friends knew.\u00a0The \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d cast knew. It wasn\u2019t a secret, in part because before he was battling steel-wielding wights as Hodor or working the wheels of steel as an internationally recognized DJ, the Northern Ireland-born Nairn was focused on giving steely looks as a drag star named Revvlon.\u00a0\n\u201cMy friend and I one night, I think we were bored and we were watching probably \u2018Priscilla, Queen of the Desert\u2019 or something,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd she had her makeup with her and put makeup on me, and something happened. I felt different, and the shy person I still was, was not there anymore.\u201d\nThus the persona Revvlon was born, partly as a response to the people in his life who didn\u2019t think he could perform.\n\u201cSo many times in my life someone said to me, \u2018You couldn\u2019t do that. You shouldn\u2019t do that. You\u2019d probably look quite strange,\u2019 and I went, \u2018Fuck you. I\u2019ll do what I want.\u2019\u201d\nFor the next five or six years, a 20-something Nairn was part of the drag world while he was attending music college and taking part in theater. One night, while hosting at a gay bar in Belfast called Kremlin,\u00a0he filled in for a DJ out sick and hasn\u2019t looked back since. He first DJed in the drag persona and then decided just to be himself.\n\u201cWhile I love drag and admire what it does for people \u2015 and what it did for me was unbelievable \u2015 I was ready to be me,\u201d\u00a0the now-42-year-old actor said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying I\u2019ll never do it again. ... I\u2019m such a big fan of\u00a0\u2018Drag Race.\u2019\u00a0Every time I watch it, I\u2019m going, \u2018I\u2019d slay all you bitches.\u2019\u201d (For the record, he\u2019s coy about whether he\u2019d join the show as a judge: \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d)\u00a0\nWith Nairn so visible in the gay community, it was strange to him for people to think he came out in that \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d interview. Nairn concedes he probably had to make it public at some point but \u201chaving to come out to the internet is weird.\u201d\u00a0\nOverall, the feedback he received was mostly positive. He accrued\u00a0\u201ca few more gay fans\u201d from the experience and suddenly became much more popular on the gay dating app Scruff.\n\u201cPeople never believe it\u2019s me,\u201d he noted. \u201cThey\u2019re just like, \u2018Haha. What are you using Hodor or Kristian Nairn\u2019s photograph for?\u2019\u201d\nBut some people were still less than pleasant.\n\u201cI think the worst [response] I got was, \u2018I hope your character dies and you die in real life.\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018Thanks, girl,\u2019\u201d Nairn said with a laugh. The actor said ultimately he doesn\u2019t \u201cgive a shit\u201d about nasty comments, adding, \u201cThey\u2019re not going to have the balls to say that to my face.\u201d\nReally, Nairn said he wishes people would \u201cjust watch the bloody show\u201d and stop judging others for what they do in their private life.\n\u201dA lot of things would be solved if people would just fuck off from other people\u2019s lives,\u201d he said.\nNairn continues touring around the world as a DJ, with multiple appearances planned at Ushuaia in Ibiza, Spain, this summer. He\u2019s starring in the upcoming horror movie \u201cThe Appearance.\u201d And he\u2019s even involved in a secret project that, when we spoke earlier this month, he said would hit the internet \u201cin a few weeks.\u201d Nairn says he owes a lot of his opportunities to the show that made his life \u201cunrecognizable.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt just makes things possible,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere they weren\u2019t possible before, now they are.\u201d\nAnd as a result, our interview turned to all matters \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d pretty quickly. How are you not going to ask Hodor about \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d? In particular,\u00a0a lot of the chat focused on his Season 6 exit \u2015 which Nairn called a bit of a \u201cmystery.\u201d\u00a0\nThat\u2019s right. Nairn, being his mischievous self, is ready to cast some doubt on Hodor\u2019s big death scene.\u00a0Kristian, what do you have to say for yourself?\nHave you seen Season 7?\nI\u2019ve seen bits and pieces, most of it. I do love it. I will call myself definitely a fan of the show. It\u2019s strange that I\u2019m not in it anymore. It\u2019s very bizarre. I didn\u2019t like watching it while I was in it for a different set of reasons, but it is strange not being part of that machine anymore because it was such a big part of my life every day.\nYou heard Hodor was dying from a castmate?\nYeah,\u00a0[Finn Jones] tipped me off. He got the script before me. We all do that thing. \u201cDo we make it to the end of the season?\u201d And he was like, \u201cNo, you don\u2019t, but it\u2019s a really cool way you\u2019re gonna go.\u201d And three days later, I got the call from [showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss saying] just that: \u201cThis is your last season, but it\u2019s a really cool scene. You\u2019re gonna be happy.\u201d Hodor was such a close character in my heart, also to the fans of the show. I think he deserves that send-off.\n\u201cThe Door,\u201d the episode where he sacrifices himself, is one of my favorites.\nMe too. Me too.\u00a0I think it\u2019s so well done, and you also have that little bit of mystery at the end because you don\u2019t actually see him die. Is he dead? Who knows?\nWhaaat? You said you would be open for coming back, right?\nHeck yeah. I need the money, man.\u00a0[Laughs]\u00a0No, anything to still be a part of that show. You never know.\u00a0You\u2019ll see in ... God knows how many bloody years it is until [Season 8] is released.\u00a0It just seems to get further and further away.\nHave you been to set?\nNo. Well ... it\u2019s right down the road from my house [in Belfast]. I live in Westeros, so I can\u2019t help but sort of still be around.\nHave David Benioff and Dan Weiss ever asked you to come back?\nI\u2019m not gonna tell you that.\u00a0Nice try.\n[Laughs]\u00a0I\u2019m a journalist. I gotta ask.\u00a0How has it been since Hodor\u2019s death? Is everyone constantly holding the door for you?\u00a0\nMore often, they want me to hold the door for them. I never expected the kind of response I\u2019ve had. Every day, I get emotions from people. They still cry. It feels like it just happened the other day!\nWhat\u2019s your reaction to the Hodor doorstops?\nWhere\u2019s my commission? [Laughs] No, just joking. It\u2019s usually very flattering.\nWhat do you think actually happened when Hodor died?\nI think the whole ambiguity of it is part of the fun. People want these rational explanations, and I\u2019m like, \u201cYou know these things don\u2019t actually happen in real life?\u201d Maybe someone waved a wand somewhere and said expelliarmus, and it just happens. ... Gandalf stuck his fucking staff in the ground and said, \u201cYou shall not pass.\u201d\nWhat I think is, I don\u2019t even know. I don\u2019t know if I think about it too much. I just think that when\u00a0[Bran] was warged into the past, he obviously could see Hodor as a child. And when Meera Reed was meaning him to warg into Hodor, he kind of warged into both\u00a0[Hodor and young Hodor] and he connected them both over this huge time fucking vortex and probably fried Hodor\u2019s brain. He connected them both, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the way it\u2019s supposed to happen. What is it Emmett Brown says [in \u201cBack to the Future\u201d]? Flux capacitor? But it\u2019s a big bang inside Hodor\u2019s head. That\u2019s my theory.\nFrom that death, and the reveal that Bran can affect the past, came the theory that Bran may have been the cause for everything and it\u2019s a time loop.\nThere are all sorts of theories, man. I think the one theory that holds water is a lot of it wouldn\u2019t have happened if it wasn\u2019t for Bran. Because he was told not to climb that tower, and he disobeyed his mother. He climbed up and saw Jaime and Cersei getting jiggy with it, and that\u2019s what started it all? Really? If he had just obeyed his mother, it would have been a very boring show.\u00a0\nSo how did you become Hodor?\nI always had a guy who would get me auditions, he was loosely termed an agent, and he put me forward for a Simon Pegg movie called \u201cHot Fuzz,\u201d which I didn\u2019t get the part. It went terribly. I was DJing until 6 a.m.\u00a0from the night before and had to fly to London and get straight off a plane to do an audition. Worst audition ever. But it was Nina Gold who cast \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d and four years later she called me back. Four years?\u00a0You remember for four years? Probably because it was the shittiest audition, and she said, \u201cLet\u2019s give you another go at a different part,\u201d and, yeah, that\u2019s how that happened. And from that day, everything\u2019s been different.\nI think I saw an audition online.\nYeah\u00a0...\u00a0I didn\u2019t understand what the part was. That was the second proper audition I\u2019ve ever done, and I didn\u2019t understand what the character was about then. Someone just said, \u201cThis guy can only say \u2018Hodor,\u2019\u201d and I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat? What?\u00a0Why?\u201d They\u2019re like, \u201cWe don\u2019t know,\u201d and I\u2019m like, \u201cGive me some backstory.\u201d No one knows, so I just did my interpretation of it, I guess, and they liked it.\nI like how that little kid in the audition tape is so\u00a0committed to playing Bran there, too.\nI think he was up for the part of Bran as well. Obviously, it didn\u2019t go his way, but yeah, he was a little actor as well. I think it was his mother\u2019s 40th birthday or something, and we just crashed the party, and it was like, \u201cWe need to use your garden and your child.\u201d So I didn\u2019t know what the fuck was happening.\nAnd after that, it was like no chance. I mean, I\u2019m not going to hear anything from that, and two days later it was it. They were in Belfast. They want you to come out and say hello. And I was like, \u201cOK?\u201d And then they gave me the part then and there.\nWhat did you do when you got it? Did you just call everyone you know?\nI don\u2019t think anyone really realized how big it was gonna be.\u00a0You know? Is it going to be one of those Dungeons and Dragons, straight to Syfy channel type things? That\u2019s what it kind of felt like, and I spoke to my mother about it, and she was like, \u201cNo, no, no, no, no. This is going to be different.\u00a0These are famous, famous books.\u201d She read them, so she was like, \u201cYeah you\u2019re perfect for Hodor.\u201d [Laugh]\nThere are mashups online of all the different ways you say Hodor.\nOh, God. I haven\u2019t watched it.\nWell,\u00a0somewhere in the world there was a [soundboard] of, I think, me saying it 75 different ways, which we had to do for ADR.\u00a0That was terrible, man. They\u2019re just like, \u201cStand there for 15 minutes and do it different every time.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat? C\u2019mon.\u201d He\u2019s such a reactionary character. He\u2019s reacting to everything happening around him, and then you\u2019re stuck in a little black studio, and I have nothing to react to.\nBesides all the extra work for acting, you\u2019d also DJ while working on the show?\nI would actually DJ until 3 a.m. Call time would be 5. So I would have to shoot home, and then would have like 45 minutes and to try to catch up during the day in your trailer. It was tough because the body, it was all very physical, because of Isaac and stuff. Especially in the first couple of seasons. I pushed myself further than I thought I could.\nDid you have any idea he was going to turn out so big? Isaac Hempstead Wright is like 6 feet tall now.\nNo! I certainly didn\u2019t! But we had doubles ... we had a double for Bran who\u2019s name was Samantha,\u00a0a smaller girl, and we had a double for Hodor as well for wide shots, which is really strange.\u00a0It\u2019s always like 10 miles away.\u00a0I\u2019m like, \u201cReally? Is it the same postman?\u201d But we used those for wide shots and sometimes your body would just stop working, and they\u2019d do it from behind or something. Sam was a lot lighter than Isaac.\u00a0Her legs were a lot shorter.\nHave you and Isaac been able to keep in touch?\nOh, yeah. We still talk a lot at least once every two weeks or whatever, but I\u2019m not the cool uncle anymore. It\u2019s gotten to the age now where some of the things he tells me, I\u2019m like, \u201cIsaac! C\u2019mon!\u201d He\u2019s 19 now. I just want to slap him.\u00a0I\u2019m like, \u201cC\u2019mon.\u201d That\u2019s my experience. I can\u2019t do \u201cI\u2019m so cool.\u201d I can\u2019t do that anymore. I get more and more parental.\nI think Isaac once said he used to sing \u201cSpongeBob\u201d in your ear while you carried him around.\nI have like a nervous tic when you say that.\u00a0That\u2019s when he\u2019s on my back, man. He\u2019d just sing into my ear, and he can\u2019t sing worth shit.\u00a0It\u2019s just repetition, repetition,\u00a0repetition.\u00a0Drove me crazy, man. When a kid realizes you\u2019ve got like a trigger switch ... yeah, lucky me.\nThat was cool when you came out and reunited with him on \u201cConan.\u201d\u00a0\nIt was a nice moment. Though I saw some weird memes after that. You know what it\u2019s like when you\u2019re a gay man and stuff and the playground mentality of almost putting Isaac and I in a relationship, and I\u2019m like, he\u2019s a child. I\u2019ve known him since he was 8 or 9. He feels like an adopted son. That\u2019s another one. Step away from Instagram, please. Get some fresh air.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s so weird. And Hodor was the subject of so many memes.\nEveryone likes a good old meme, apart from me. [Laughs]\u00a0\nSo where do you see yourself in the future? I saw some articles where you said you\u2019d think about\u00a0running for office?\nThat was vastly, vastly taken ... you need a huge bucketload of fucking salt for that comment. ... I have no plans. No plans.\u00a0As far as I am as a person, I will speak out against things. But I have no plans to run for any political office.\u00a0\nThis is a weird little country here [in Northern Ireland] where I\u2019m from.\u00a0We\u2019re the little magical kingdom in the corner in the U.K. and Ireland, [where gay people] don\u2019t have rights to be married. Whereas in Ireland, they do, and in U.K., they do. And also now with the abortion thing, somehow we have this little crystal castle ... it\u2019s incredibly frustrating, and I don\u2019t know if you know much about politics here. I\u2019m from a mixed background. I can see issues on both sides, and that\u2019s what makes me really sad. To progress, we need a whole new set of politics. We need to throw the arseholes on both sides out and start again with the younger people. People who aren\u2019t embittered by the past. The past has happened and has to be remembered, but it shouldn\u2019t be affecting the future.\nThis is a complicated little country. I love it here. I love this country. I love the people here. It\u2019s like no country in the whole world. The sense of humor here. The people have huge hearts, and that\u2019s because they\u2019ve been through so much shit. It\u2019s about time that we\u2019re looking forward instead of looking backward. I can\u2019t see it happening anytime soon. We have government here who\u2019s paid to be in government and they\u2019re not actually doing work because they won\u2019t talk to each other, and they\u2019re getting paid as civil servants, and they\u2019re not actually there. It\u2019s a really bad joke, and the only people who are laughing are them, the politicians.\nWhere do you want to be then? What do you actually want to do?\nI would like to be doing what I\u2019m doing, exactly what I\u2019m doing. Maybe a little slower pace. I would like to still have a voice. I don\u2019t want to disappear. You never know what\u2019s going to happen, man. I\u2019m not like a Zac Efron Hollywood type. It\u2019s not like I have 20 other people who look like me. It\u2019s pretty much only me, so I\u2019ll just continue to be who I am and try to be real. I try to pride myself on being real. I have a hard time not telling the truth, but that gets me in trouble all the time. But is that a bad thing? I don\u2019t think it is.\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n#TheFutureIsQueer is HuffPost\u2019s monthlong celebration of queerness, not just as an identity but as action in the world.
