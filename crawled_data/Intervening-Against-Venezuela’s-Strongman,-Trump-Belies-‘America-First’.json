{"title": "Intervening Against Venezuela\u2019s Strongman, Trump Belies \u2018America First\u2019", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump has finally met a strongman he does not like. After making friends with autocrats around the world, Mr. Trump has drawn a red line with Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, demanding that the iron-fisted president of Venezuela hand power to his opposition.\nMr. Trump\u2019s forceful challenge to Mr. Maduro is the first such intervention in his anti-interventionist presidency, a sharp departure from an \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy aimed at extracting the United States from overseas quagmires and staying out of the internal affairs of other countries.\nThe president\u2019s decision to advocate what amounts to a regime change in Venezuela, encouraged by Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, and other longstanding critics of the leftist leadership in Caracas, is the sort of international assertion that Mr. Trump has disdained in past administrations \u2014 and one with enormous risks.\nAs the Venezuelan military stands by Mr. Maduro, the situation could easily descend into further violence, with American diplomats potentially in the cross hairs. Mr. Trump said that \u201call options are on the table,\u201d suggesting the possibility of military force. But even if it does not come to that, Mr. Trump faces a loss of credibility if Mr. Maduro ultimately defies American pressure and holds onto power.\n\u201cThe administration\u2019s posture toward Venezuela is a foreign policy gamble that in hindsight could look prescient\u201d if Mr. Maduro is forced out \u201cor reckless if that doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d said Rob Malley, the president of the International Crisis Group and a former aide to Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. \u201cAt that point, the ball will be squarely in the U.S. court, with the risk that it does little and displays impotence or, worse, intervenes militarily and demonstrates rashness.\u201d\nFor now, the administration emphasized diplomatic and economic options, hoping to maintain regional solidarity. At a meeting on Thursday in Washington, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged all of the 35 members of the Organization of American States to recognize Juan Guaid\u00f3, the head of the National Assembly, as Venezuela\u2019s new president, as Canada, Brazil, Argentina and many others in the region already have.\n\u201cThe regime of former President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro is illegitimate,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said. \u201cHis regime is morally bankrupt, it\u2019s economically incompetent and it is profoundly corrupt. It is undemocratic to the core.\u201d\nSo too, of course, are plenty of other countries, yet Mr. Trump has made friends with authoritarian leaders in places like Russia, China, North Korea, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the Philippines. That Venezuela would trip his outrage meter reflects a confluence of factors, including who has his ear when it comes to Latin America.\n\u201cIt is so at odds with what we\u2019ve seen in other parts of the world,\u201d said Michael Shifter, the president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a think tank on Western Hemisphere affairs. \u201cBut Latin America is different. It\u2019s where domestic politics has a greater role than other parts of the world.\u201d\nMr. Rubio has been a pivotal figure in pressing the Trump administration to take a harder line on Mr. Maduro. For Mr. Rubio, like other Cuban American leaders, the ties between Mr. Maduro\u2019s Venezuela and the Castro-era Cuba loom large.\nJust weeks after Mr. Trump took office, Mr. Rubio arranged for a White House meeting with Lilian Tintori, the wife of Leopoldo L\u00f3pez, an opposition leader currently under house arrest and the architect of Mr. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s rise. Mr. Trump was said to be impressed with Ms. Tintori and from then on regularly asked aides for updates about Venezuela. Mr. Rubio also gave the White House a list of Venezuelan officials to target, and they were then duly sanctioned by the administration.\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Rubio visited the White House again to talk with Mr. Trump about a plan to recognize Mr. Guaid\u00f3 as the legitimate president of Venezuela if he formally announced his new position, according to a Senate aide briefed on the meeting. The senator and White House officials also discussed steps to take if Mr. Maduro resists and escalates the situation, said the aide, who declined to describe contingency plans.\nWhen Mr. Guaid\u00f3 did claim the presidency the next day on the grounds that the last presidential election was rigged, Mr. Trump followed through by recognizing him, prompting Mr. Maduro to break diplomatic ties and order American diplomats out of the country within 72 hours.\nIn television interviews on Thursday, Mr. Rubio threatened retaliation if Mr. Maduro\u2019s forces harmed American personnel, almost sounding like a spokesman for the Trump administration.\n\u201cWe are also going to impose grave consequences on the people responsible for that harm, and that should be very clearly understood,\u201d he said on MSNBC. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not some idle threat, I\u2019m telling you. I can\u2019t go any further than that, but I\u2019m telling you the consequences will be significant.\u201d\nWithin the Trump administration, Mr. Pompeo and Mauricio Claver-Carone, the senior director of Western Hemisphere affairs on the National Security Council, have been two of the biggest backers of a forceful stand on Venezuela.\nMr. Pompeo played an important role during a trip early this month to Brazil and Colombia, said a person with connections to opposition leaders in Venezuela. Mr. Pompeo signaled to leaders in both countries that if Latin American nations came up with a reasonable plan on Venezuela, the United States would stand with them, this person said. That was one factor that contributed to Canada and 12 Latin American nations issuing a statement on Jan. 4 that said they would not recognize Mr. Maduro\u2019s presidency.\nThe statement was stronger than even American officials had expected, the person said. Mr. Pompeo has also been in close contact with Chrystia Freeland, the Canadian foreign minister, who has played a leading role in rallying global criticism of Mr. Maduro. On Jan. 16, the two spoke by phone about Venezuela, among other issues.\nMr. Trump\u2019s tough stand this week drew some bipartisan support. Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and one of the president\u2019s strongest critics, called the recognition of Mr. Guaid\u00f3 \u201can appropriate step to support the democratic aspirations of the Venezuelan people.\u201d\nBut like others, Mr. Schiff noted the disparity between Mr. Trump\u2019s approach to Mr. Maduro and other autocrats. \u201cWe must also remember that America\u2019s support for democracy and human rights must apply universally if it is to be credible,\u201d he said.\nThat was not Mr. Trump\u2019s view when he came to office. In his first foreign trip as president, Mr. Trump told an audience in Saudi Arabia that he would not dictate how other countries treat their own citizens. \u201cWe are not here to lecture,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not here to tell other people how to live, what to do, who to be or how to worship.\u201d\nJust last month, Mr. Trump abruptly ordered the withdrawal of troops from Syria, arguing that the United States\u2019 only interest there was fighting the Islamic State. He offered no criticism of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, who has waged war against his own citizens, resulting in hundreds of thousands of casualties and millions of displaced people.\n\u201cDoes the USA want to be the Policeman of the Middle East,\u201d Mr. Trump asked then on Twitter, denouncing the notion that the United States had a role to play \u201cprotecting others\u201d in the region.\nHis national security adviser, John R. Bolton, brushed off questions on Thursday about why Mr. Maduro was worse than other autocrats Mr. Trump has befriended.\n\u201cWell, your question is full of fallacies,\u201d Mr. Bolton told reporters. \u201cThe fact is Venezuela is in our hemisphere. I think we have a special responsibility here, and I think the president feels very strongly about it.\u201d\nThat \u201cspecial responsibility\u201d dates to the earliest days of the republic and the Monroe Doctrine asserting a leading role for the United States in the Western Hemisphere. The history of interventions, coups and military adventures in Latin America has defined the relationship with the region ever since.\n\u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s reaction shows how deeply rooted the regime change instinct is,\u201d said Stephen Walt, a Harvard University professor of international relations. \u201cWhenever the United States faces a hostile government, the temptation to try to overturn it is always there. Needless to say, this has been especially true in Latin America.\u201d\nMr. Shifter said the president\u2019s involvement was welcome. \u201cIf you look at it in a wider context, it\u2019s hard to say this shows a broader commitment to human rights and democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut from my perspective, we\u2019ll take what we can get. In my view, he\u2019s on the right side of this one. Whether he\u2019s got a strategy, whether it\u2019s all been thought out, I don\u2019t know.\u201d", "date": "Jan. 24, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/24/world/americas/donald-trump-venezuela.html", "tags": "american \u2018 america first \u201c venezuela maduro strongman states trump belies intervening"}
