{"title": "On Eve of Michael Cohen\u2019s Testimony, Republican Threatens to Reveal Compromising Information", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 In an atmosphere of high drama and low tactics, Michael D. Cohen, President Trump\u2019s former lawyer, prepared for his explosive public testimony about the president on Wednesday even as a Republican member of Congress threatened to reveal what he said were Mr. Cohen\u2019s extramarital affairs.\nMr. Cohen\u2019s long-awaited appearance before the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, coming after he spent Tuesday behind closed doors answering questions from the Senate Intelligence Committee, is likely to be among the more revealing and polarizing moments of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency.\n[Mr. Cohen plans to use his testimony on Wednesday to unspool a narrative laced with regret of his decade working alongside Mr. Trump.]\nWith the partisan stakes so high, Representative Matt Gaetz, a firebrand Republican from Florida, went after Mr. Cohen pre-emptively with a personal attack that some Democrats said amounted to witness intimidation.\n\u201cHey @MichaelCohen212 - Do your wife & father-in-law know about your girlfriends? Maybe tonight would be a good time for that chat. I wonder if she\u2019ll remain faithful when you\u2019re in prison. She\u2019s about to learn a lot,\u201d Mr. Gaetz said on Twitter.\nIn a statement, Lanny J. Davis, a lawyer and spokesman for Mr. Cohen, said he would not respond to what he called \u201cMr. Gaetz\u2019s despicable lies and personal smears,\u201d but called on both parties to \u201crepudiate his words and his conduct.\u201d\nLate Wednesday night, Mr. Gaetz walked back his remarks after Speaker Nancy Pelosi offered a warning, saying that such comments could affect the committee\u2019s ability to \u201cobtain the truthful and complete information necessary.\u201d\n\u201cWhile it is important 2 create context around the testimony of liars like Michael Cohen, it was NOT my intent to threaten, as some believe I did,\u201d Mr. Gaetz tweeted. \u201cI\u2019m deleting the tweet & I should have chosen words that better showed my intent. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nIn his public testimony on Wednesday, Mr. Cohen plans to describe \u201cin granular detail\u201d a scheme hatched in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election to make hush money payments to a pornographic film actress who claimed to have had an affair with Mr. Trump, people familiar with his plans said. And he will say the scheme, which led to a campaign finance-related charge against him, was initiated by Mr. Trump.\nMr. Cohen will not be allowed to publicly discuss matters related to the continuing special counsel investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russian election manipulation efforts. Those topics were sure to have been covered on Tuesday in his closed-door appearance with the Senate Intelligence Committee and will be again on Thursday in secret testimony to the House Intelligence Committee.\nMr. Cohen\u2019s testimony \u2014 coming as the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, prepares to conclude his investigation, and with House Democrats starting their own \u2014 signals the beginning of what could be a perilous new phase for Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency.\nMr. Gaetz\u2019s threat and the enraged reaction to it reflected the stakes on Capitol Hill in anticipation of Wednesday\u2019s open hearing.\nNeither Mr. Cohen nor members of the Senate Intelligence Committee provided details of his testimony on Tuesday. Mr. Cohen began his meeting with the senators by apologizing for lying to them in 2017 about the duration of time during the 2016 campaign that the Trump Organization was in discussions about a Trump Tower project in Moscow, people familiar with what took place said.\nMr. Cohen emerged from a secure room in the Senate after more than eight hours of questioning and told reporters that he appreciated \u201cthe opportunity that was given to me\u201d to tell the truth.\n\u201cI look forward to tomorrow to be able to, in my voice, tell the American people my story,\u201d he said. \u201cI am going to let the American people decide exactly who\u2019s telling the truth.\u201d\nSenators who sat through the session indicated that Mr. Cohen\u2019s testimony had made a strong impression on them. Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said Mr. Cohen appeared to be \u201chumbled by the experience he has been through and what he knows lies ahead of him.\u201d\nSenator Mark Warner of Virginia, the panel\u2019s top Democrat, said the committee\u2019s investigation was the most important thing he was doing in the Senate. \u201cNothing I heard from today dissuades me from that view,\u201d he said.\nMr. Trump and his allies have been preparing for days for the appearance and for the potential for a split-screen drama as the president meets in Vietnam with the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un. The president\u2019s aides have been anxious about the effect that the testimony might have on him.\nEven before Mr. Gaetz\u2019s tweet, Mr. Trump\u2019s Republican allies in the House were prepared to aggressively question Mr. Cohen\u2019s credibility. They have signaled that they will dig into his own past business dealings and publicly documented attempts to monetize his relationship with the president to try to paint Mr. Cohen as a liar fabricating stories to lessen his time in jail.\nIn a statement on Tuesday morning, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, denounced Mr. Cohen as a \u201cdisgraced felon\u201d who was already \u201cgoing to prison for lying to Congress and making other false statements.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s laughable that anyone would take a convicted liar like Cohen at his word, and pathetic to see him given yet another opportunity to spread his lies,\u201d she said.\nMr. Gaetz\u2019s tweet took the effort to undermine Mr. Cohen to another level.\nIn a text earlier Wednesday, Mr. Gaetz rejected assertions that his tweet could amount to witness intimidation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s testing the veracity and character of Michael Cohen,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat is allowed.\u201d\nLike all members of Congress, Mr. Gaetz is covered under the \u201cspeech or debate\u201d clause of the Constitution, which grants lawmakers wide latitude in their comments when Congress is in session and has been cited many times in the past as protection against punishment.\nA federal law makes it a crime to intimidate or threaten people in an attempt to influence, delay or prevent their testimony in official proceedings, and a congressional hearing certainly counts.\nIt is not clear, though, whether a loose, ambiguous and public statement on social media qualifies and whether constitutional protections for congressional speech and debate would shield Mr. Gaetz from some forms of liability.\nRandall D. Eliason, a former federal prosecutor who teaches white-collar criminal law at George Washington University, said a successful criminal prosecution of Mr. Gaetz appeared to be unlikely on the available evidence.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real tendency these days to leap immediately to allegations of criminal misconduct,\u201d Mr. Eliason said. \u201cThere are a lot of things that are reprehensible but not criminal. I think proving the required corrupt intent to obstruct justice based on a single, public tweet would be pretty difficult.\u201d\nThere are other possible remedies. The Constitution allows the House to \u201cpunish its members for disorderly behavior,\u201d and it is at least conceivable that Mr. Gaetz could face some form of discipline from his colleagues.\nRepresentative Bill Pascrell Jr., a veteran Democrat from New Jersey, said on Twitter that Mr. Gaetz\u2019s comments were \u201cgrossly unethical and probably illegal,\u201d raising the possibility of witness intimidation.\n\u201cHouse Ethics must investigate this disgrace and stain on our institution,\u201d he wrote.\nMr. Gaetz later defended his comments in a brief speech on the House floor, saying it is \u201centirely appropriate for any member of this body to challenge the truthfulness, veracity and character of people who have a history of lying and have a future that undoubtedly contains nothing but lies.\u201d\nMr. Gaetz has developed a reputation as a champion of Mr. Trump who, like the president, is unafraid of making statements many would consider outlandish. At a recent Judiciary Committee hearing on gun control, he got into an argument with parents of students killed last year in a massacre at a high school in Parkland, Fla., and sought to have them ejected.\nMr. Cohen\u2019s team has suggested that it is prepared for Republican efforts to impugn his credibility. Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty in November to violating campaign finance laws, financial crimes and lying to Congress in two separate prosecutions, one brought by federal prosecutors in Manhattan and the other by Mr. Mueller. Mr. Cohen was disbarred on Tuesday in New York State.\nPublic testimony provides Mr. Cohen with an opportunity to tell his story under penalty of perjury before an audience of millions of people, about two months before he is scheduled to report to prison.\nMr. Cohen has spent more than 70 hours with investigators for the special counsel investigating possible conspiracy by the Trump campaign with Russian officials, as well as with investigators from the Southern District of New York.", "date": "Feb. 26, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/26/us/politics/michael-cohen-testimony.html", "tags": "testimony reveal threatens information committee compromising \u201d trump cohen house republican michael eve gaetz"}
