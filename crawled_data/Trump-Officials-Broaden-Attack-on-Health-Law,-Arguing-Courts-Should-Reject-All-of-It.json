{"title": "Trump Officials Broaden Attack on Health Law, Arguing Courts Should Reject All of It", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration broadened its attack on the Affordable Care Act on Monday, telling a federal appeals court that it now believed the entire law should be invalidated.\nThe administration had previously said that the law\u2019s protections for people with pre-existing conditions should be struck down, but that the rest of the law, including the expansion of Medicaid, should survive.\nIf the appeals court accepts the Trump administration\u2019s new arguments, millions of people could lose health insurance, including those who gained coverage through the expansion of Medicaid and those who have private coverage subsidized by the federal government.\n\u201cThe Justice Department is no longer asking for partial invalidation of the Affordable Care Act, but says the whole law should be struck down,\u201d Abbe R. Gluck, a law professor at Yale who has closely followed the litigation, said on Monday. \u201cNot just some of the insurance provisions, but all of it, including the Medicaid expansion and hundreds of other reforms. That\u2019s a total bombshell, which could have dire consequences for millions of people.\u201d\nThe new position is also certain to reignite a political furor over the Affordable Care Act, ensuring that it will figure even more prominently in the 2020 elections. Democrats have been saying that President Trump still wants to abolish the law, and they can now point to the Justice Department\u2019s filing as evidence to support that contention.\n[What happens if Obamacare is struck down?

It changed the way Medicare pays doctors, hospitals and other health care providers. It has unleashed a tidal wave of innovation in the delivery of health care. The health insurance industry has invented a new business model selling coverage to anyone who applies, regardless of any pre-existing conditions.\nThe law also includes dozens of provisions that are less well known and not related to the individual mandate. It requires nutrition labeling and calorie counts on menu items at chain restaurants. It requires certain employers to provide \u201creasonable break time\u201d and a private space for nursing mothers to pump breast milk. It improved prescription drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries, and it created a new pathway for the approval of less expensive versions of biologic medicines made from living cells.\nLawyers said invalidation of the entire law would raise numerous legal and practical questions. It is, they said, difficult to imagine what the health care world would look like without the Affordable Care Act.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s new position was harshly criticized by the insurance industry and by consumer advocates.\nThe government\u2019s position \u201cputs coverage at risk for more than 100 million Americans,\u201d said Matt Eyles, the president and chief executive of America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans.\nLeslie Dach, the chairman of Protect Our Care, a consumer advocacy group, said: \u201cIn November, voters overwhelmingly rejected President Trump\u2019s health care repeal and sabotage agenda. But he remains dead set on accomplishing through the courts what he and his allies in Congress could not do legislatively: fully repeal the law, devastate American health care and leave millions of Americans at risk.\u201d\nThe Trump administration\u2019s new stance appears to put Republicans in Congress in an awkward position. They have repeatedly tried to repeal the health law. But in the last year, they said over and over that they wanted to protect coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, and those protections are among the law\u2019s most popular provisions.\nThe lawsuit challenging the Affordable Care Act, Texas v. United States, was filed last year by a group of Republican governors and state attorneys general. Officials from California and more than a dozen other states have intervened to defend the law.\nThe Texas lawsuit \u201cis as dangerous as it is reckless,\u201d Xavier Becerra, the attorney general of California, said on Monday as he filed a brief urging the appeals court to uphold the law.", "date": "March 25, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/25/us/politics/obamacare-unconstitutional-trump-aca.html", "tags": "care officials court new \u201d trump act broaden courts reject affordable attack arguing law health"}
