{"title": "Iranian General Locks Horns With Trump, Escalating Threat-Filled Feud", "content": "A powerful commander in Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards Corps escalated the invective duel with President Trump on Thursday, calling his threat against Iran\u2019s president \u201ccabaret-style rhetoric\u201d in remarks that political analysts called worrisome.\nThe commander, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, who wields enormous influence in Iran, may emerge as its future leader and is considered a terrorist mastermind by the United States. He said that Mr. Trump should pick a fight directly with him and not Iran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani.\nIn a Twitter message on Sunday posted in all-capital letters, Mr. Trump warned Mr. Rouhani that he would suffer \u201cconsequences the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before\u201d if he threatened the United States.\nTop aides to Mr. Rouhani dismissed Mr. Trump\u2019s warning, apparently viewing it as an attempt by the American president to replicate his strategy of threats against another adversary, North Korea.\nBut General Suleimani\u2019s public challenge to Mr. Trump appeared to signal that the Iranian hierarchy felt obliged to send a more assertive reply.\n\u201cIt is beneath the dignity of our president to respond to you,\u201d General Suleimani said in a speech in western Iran reported by state-run media. \u201cI, as a soldier, respond to you.\u201d\nDirectly addressing Mr. Trump, General Suleimani said: \u201cYou threaten us with an action that is \u2018unprecedented\u2019 in the world. This is cabaret-style rhetoric. Only a cabaret owner talks to the world this way.\u201d\nDeriding what he described as the history of American military failures in Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere in the region, General Suleimani said Mr. Trump was in no position to issue threats to Iran.\n\u201cWe are near you, where you can\u2019t even imagine,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are ready. We are the man of this arena.\u201d\nWhile the possibility of a war between Iran and the United States is considered extremely low, political analysts worry that escalating threats could lead to something more serious.\nGeneral Suleimani\u2019s words and actions are closely scrutinized because he is regarded as one of Iran\u2019s most cunning and autonomous military figures, in charge of its intelligence gathering and covert military operations.\n\u201cHis fire-breathing retort to Trump is important and worrisome,\u201d said Cliff Kupchan, chairman of the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy in Washington.\n\u201cSuleimani is directly mocking the U.S. president, and he lambastes U.S. policy,\u201d Mr. Kupchan said. \u201cSuleimani is telling Trump to watch his words, reminding him that Iran has both power across the Middle East and potent capability for asymmetric warfare. That\u2019s an implicit threat against U.S. assets in the Middle East.\u201d\nA once-shadowy figure who now enjoys celebritylike status among the hard-line conservatives in Iran, General Suleimani leads the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps\u2019 Quds Force, a special forces unit responsible for Iranian operations outside Iran\u2019s borders. Quds is the Persian word for Jerusalem.\nThe general is known to have the personal backing of Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and is believed to be the chief strategist behind Iran\u2019s military ventures and influence in Syria, Iraq and elsewhere in the region and beyond.\nThe United States has regarded General Suleimani as a vexing foe for many years. It accused him of plotting attacks on American soldiers in Iraq after the 2003 American-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein.\nThe Treasury Department placed him on a sanctions blacklist in 2011, accusing the commander of complicity in what American officials called a plot to kill the Saudi ambassador to Washington.\nBut the United States also has found itself in the awkward position of cooperating with General Suleimani in Iraq, where the Americans and Iranians have both worked to reverse gains made by the Islamic State.\nHe was in the northern Iraqi city of Tikrit in 2015, commanding Iraqi Shiite militias attempting to recapture it from Islamic State fighters before American warplanes belatedly joined that campaign.", "date": "July 26, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/26/world/middleeast/suleimani-iran-trump.html", "tags": "iran mr. threat-filled feud escalating president united \u201d trump horns iranian general suleimani locks"}
