{"title": "Trump, Prioritizing Economy Over Climate, Cites Disputed Premises", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 In making his case for abandoning the Paris climate accord, President Trump characterized the agreement as an economic straitjacket \u2014 one that would impose terrible burdens on Americans by shuttering the coal industry, suffocating growth and redistributing jobs and wealth from the United States to its competitors.\nOne thing Mr. Trump did not do in the Rose Garden on Thursday afternoon was question the underlying science behind climate change. Indeed, the president suggested the 194-nation accord did not go far enough in stemming the rise in global temperatures because of greenhouse gas emissions.\nBut the president\u2019s address \u2014 a mix of dry statistics and emotive language \u2014 was designed to discredit the pact, point by point. And several of Mr. Trump\u2019s claims either relied on dubious data or distorted research reports.\nMr. Trump\u2019s argument started with a faulty premise \u2014 that emissions reductions under the Paris agreement are compulsory \u2014 even though at one point he acknowledged they were voluntary.\n\u201cThe United States,\u201d he said, \u201cwill cease all implementation of the nonbinding Paris accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country.\u201d\nThe president referred to a published study to claim that the climate pact would result in \u201cas much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025,\u201d of which 440,000 would be in manufacturing. By 2040, he said, the losses would balloon to 6.5 million industrial jobs, or $3 trillion in lost economic output, or about $7,000 in reduced income for the average household.\nCritics dispute the methodology of that study, by the National Economic Research Associates. They note that it was conducted for the American Council for Capital Formation and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce \u2014 both vocal opponents of climate regulations.\nEconomists argue that the projected job losses in the study assume the American economy will not use innovation to adapt to the new regulations. Apple, Mars, and Unilever are among companies that have said complying with the Paris agreement would open markets and generate jobs.\nA raft of studies \u2014 from environmental organizations, Citibank, and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development \u2014 argue that a failure to mitigate the effects of climate change could cost the economy trillions of dollars.\n\u201cChina and Europe have become world leaders on the path toward green development already,\u201d said Prof. Hans Joachim Schellnhuber of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, \u201cand will strengthen their position if the U.S. slips back at the national level.\u201d\nTo dramatize the unfairness of the agreement, Mr. Trump asserted that it allows China, the world\u2019s largest polluter, \u201cto increase these emissions by a staggering number of years \u2014 13. They can do whatever they want for 13 years.\u201d\nUnder China\u2019s pledge, emissions would indeed continue to climb until 2030, and then begin declining. But as its consumption of coal slows, China is on pace to beat that target.\nIts government has pledged to generate 20 percent of its energy from nonfossil fuel sources by 2030, a formidable goal that will require the Chinese to install at least 800 gigawatts worth of solar, wind and nuclear energy capacity \u2014 a process that is already underway.\nMr. Trump noted that the pact would allow China and India to build more coal plants, while effectively shutting down development of a clean coal industry in the United States.\n\u201cThe agreement doesn\u2019t eliminate coal jobs,\u201d the president said. \u201cIt just transfers those jobs out of America and the United States, and ships them to foreign countries.\u201d\nBecause the Paris accord is nonbinding, it has no direct effect on coal consumption in the United States. The coal industry is in long-term decline because of cheaper alternatives, such as natural gas and renewable energies, along with stricter pollution standards imposed by the Obama administration. Mr. Trump has moved to lift many of those restrictions, and he would be free to do so, even under the Paris agreement.\nMr. Trump\u2019s top economic adviser, Gary D. Cohn, acknowledged the declining role played by coal in the nation\u2019s energy mix. Speaking to reporters last week, he said, \u201cCoal doesn\u2019t even make that much sense anymore as a feedstock.\u201d\nMr. Trump tried to diminish the value of the accord by citing a Massachusetts Institute of Technology study, which said that if each nation lived up to its commitments, it would result in a reduction of only two-tenths of a degree Celsius in global temperatures by 2100.\n\u201cTiny, tiny amount,\u201d he said, holding his thumb and index finger together to drive home the point.\nBut that assertion does not accurately reflect the M.I.T. research.\nThe M.I.T. study in question looked at the difference between climate pledges made at previous talks and those made in the run-up to Paris, and it found that the Paris pledges would avoid an additional 0.2 degrees Celsius of global warming by 2100.\nBut the M.I.T. researchers also looked at the difference between all of the climate pledges made to date and a business-as-usual scenario in which countries failed to act. In an updated 2016 analysis, they found that current climate pledges would result in global average temperatures rising between 2.7 and 3.6 degrees by the end of the century, compared with between 3.3 and 4.7 degrees if no action were taken, a difference of nearly a degree. And the aim of the Paris agreement was to improve those pledges over time.\nMr. Trump saved particular vitriol for the Green Climate Fund, a United Nations program under which richer countries transfer funds to poorer ones to help them mitigate the effects of climate change.\n\u201cNice name,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe\u2019re going to be paying billions and billions and billions of dollars, and we\u2019re already way ahead of anybody else. Many of the other countries haven\u2019t spent anything, and many of them will never pay one dime.\u201d\nThe United States has pledged $3 billion to the fund, which is the most of any country in aggregate terms. But it is far from the only contributor, and on a per-capita basis, it is not the highest. Sweden has contributed $581 million, which works out to a little less than $60 per person, six times the amount the United States is pledging per capita.\nEven operating outside the Paris accord, Mr. Trump insisted that the United States would be an environmental exemplar. \u201cWe\u2019ll be the cleanest,\u201d he promised. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have the cleanest air. We\u2019re going to have the cleanest water.\u201d\nThat optimistic statement is contradicted by Yale University\u2019s latest annual Environmental Performance Index.\nThe United States ranked 26th of 180 countries, according to the index, which assesses each nation\u2019s water and air quality, biodiversity, agricultural outputs and climate change efforts. It ranked 43rd in air quality, 22nd in water sanitation, and 44th in climate and energy policies.\nMoreover, even after recent reductions, America\u2019s carbon emissions per capita remain significantly higher than those of China or India \u2014 countries that Mr. Trump branded as the world\u2019s big polluters.", "date": "June 1, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/01/us/politics/fact-check-climate-change-trump.html", "tags": "cites united prioritizing \u201d trump economy climate disputed would premises coal \u2014 paris"}
