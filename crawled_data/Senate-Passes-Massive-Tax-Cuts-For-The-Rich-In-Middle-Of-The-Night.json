{"title": "Senate Passes Massive Tax Cuts For The Rich In Middle Of The Night", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2015 When Donald Trump was elected president last year, a sweeping rewrite of the tax code was one of his top priorities. \nThroughout the campaign, Trump said he wanted a \u201cmiddle-class tax cut,\u201d one that wouldn\u2019t benefit wealthy people like him and would spur huge levels of economic growth while not adding to the national debt. \u201cFor the hedge fund guys, they\u2019re going to be paying up,\u201d Trump promised in September 2015.\nAs president, Trump has continued to insist the tax code overhaul won\u2019t be good for himself or other millionaires. \u201cThis is going to cost me a fortune, this thing \u2015 believe me,\u201d Trump said this week.\nBut the big winners in the GOP bill that the Senate passed early Saturday morning are corporations and the wealthy. Trump himself \u2015 a self-proclaimed billionaire \u2015 stands to gain millions through the elimination of certain taxes (though we don\u2019t know exactly how much because Trump won\u2019t release his tax returns). Far from being a middle-class tax cut, the measure is a massive corporate giveaway, a bill that recycles decades of Republican ideology on trickle-down economics and trusts that executives will hand over their new gains to average-income workers.\n\u201cIf my friends here want to give a tax cut to the middle class,\u201d Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) asked on the Senate floor Thursday, \u201cwhy don\u2019t we give a tax cut to the middle class?\u201d His argument had no effect.\nAfter months of negotiations, the Senate passed the proposal, 51-49, with just one Republican \u2015 Bob Corker of Tennessee \u2015 joining all Democrats in opposition. Corker took issue with how much debt the bill would produce, and after the Senate parliamentarian struck down Corker\u2019s debt-control proposal, GOP leaders invited the retiring Republican to just vote no rather than finding him an accommodation.\nWith the bill finally through the Senate \u2015 the House passed its tax bill two weeks earlier \u2015 the two chambers still have to work out their legislative differences in a conference committee before the tax rewrite becomes law. There\u2019s a slim chance the House could adopt the Senate bill and send it to the president\u2019s desk, but it\u2019s more likely that negotiators will merge the two versions. Both chambers need to pass the same measure for the bill to become law. \nFor most Americans, the legislation is still indeed \u2015 at least in the short term \u2015 a tax cut. Those cuts are due in large part to Republicans approving $1.5 trillion in added debt over the next 10 years. But of that pie, the wealthy disproportionately benefit, and some households could wind up with higher tax bills. The richest 20 percent of households reap 90 percent of the benefit of the tax cuts over that time period, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. \nStill, in the short term, it\u2019s difficult to say exactly whose taxes go up and whose go down. Tax burdens depend on what deductions individual filers claim, and this bill is a complicated tax code rewrite \u2015 one that analysts say will have limited impact on the economy, will cost the nation more than a trillion dollars over the next 10 years, and will do much more for rich investors than it will the middle class. \nDespite all that, despite poll after poll showing the measure is unpopular, most Republicans were ecstatic to pass the bill.\nWhile the bill took months to draft, the final package came together over a\u00a0frenetic last few days. Republicans didn\u2019t even have finished legislative text until\u00a0Friday\u00a0night, hours before the vote, and Democrats slammed their GOP colleagues for rushing through a bill that was cobbled together with handwritten changes and crossed-out pages at the last minute.\nThose procedural concerns did nothing to slow the bill, however, with Republicans falling in line to vote down a Democratic motion to adjourn\u00a0Friday\u00a0night. Senators then began a so-called vote-a-rama,\u00a0in which amendments get up-or-down approval one after the other until lawmakers are exhausted enough to stop. Eventually, in the early hours of\u00a0Saturday\u00a0morning, senators moved to a final vote on the reconciliation bill, and it passed.\nTo get the bill over the 50-vote threshold for reconciliation legislation, GOP leaders cut deals this week on how much certain businesses could deduct off the top of their tax bills, as well as on what would be included in an upcoming government funding measure. \nSen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), for example, demanded that year-end spending legislation include funding for Obamacare subsidies that the Trump administration has targeted. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said he got assurances on a contentious immigration program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, though Trump administration officials said Flake only got assurances on being part of the conversation.\nOverall, the legislation would cut the corporate tax rate from 35 to 20 percent, which has been the GOP\u2019s priority all along. Republicans say this dramatic reduction will unleash the economy and raise wages by making big businesses more internationally competitive \u2015 claims that are dubious according to corporate executives themselves, who say they will throw the money at shareholders instead of workers.\nIn addition to reducing corporate and individual tax rates across the board, the bill would simplify the tax code by getting rid of most deductions, which businesses and individuals use to reduce the amount of their income subject to taxation.\nBecause Congress over the years has added write-offs in order to encourage and subsidize certain endeavors \u2015 such as homeownership and higher education \u2015 the mass elimination of these tax preferences could have wide-ranging effects that are incidental to the overall Republican goal of encouraging business investment. \nAxing deductions for state and local taxes, for instance, while increasing the value of a fixed \u201cstandard deduction,\u201d would result in far fewer households finding it worthwhile to deduct the amount they spend on mortgage interest. A study commissioned by the National Association of Realtors earlier this year said the proposal would reduce home values by 10 percent (which could be a good thing for people who don\u2019t already own homes). Republicans have long championed homeownership but have been undeterred by a lobbying blitz from the real estate industry. \nWhile fewer deductions makes for a simpler tax code, the bill would also create a complicated new deduction for certain businesses that aren\u2019t taxed as corporations. Determining which firms have the kind of \u201cqualified business income\u201d eligible for the deduction will require many pages of new IRS regulation, though the bill explicitly excludes high-income service providers like accountants, lawyers and investment managers. \nIn the day before the final vote, Republicans increased the value of the deduction to win over Sens. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and Steve Daines (R-Mont.), both of whom had previously withheld support because they felt the legislation disproportionately benefited firms that pay the corporate tax. \nAnd in a catchall \u201cmanager\u2019s amendment\u201d adopted just before the bill passed, Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) added a provision to allow publicly traded partnerships to claim the new deduction. Victor Fleischer, a tax professor at the University of San Diego School of law, said\u00a0that the Cornyn amendment would specifically benefit oil and gas companies.\n\u201cWe should all re-read \u2018Why Nations Fail\u2019 after this tax bill passes,\u201d Fleischer said\u00a0on Twitter. \nAnother provision in the manager\u2019s amendment, inserted by Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), would have exempted schools that don\u2019t take federal funds, such as the conservative Hillsdale College in Michigan, from a new tax on college and university endowments. The tax seems designed less to raise money than to poke educated liberals in the eye. Several Republicans joined Democrats in defeating the amendment. Toomey\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment.\nTo keep the cost of the bill beneath $1.5 trillion \u2015 an arbitrary level Republicans set for themselves in a budget process earlier this year \u2015 almost all of the tax cuts for individuals expire at the end of 2025. Republicans say that expiration won\u2019t happen, noting that even President Barack Obama made nearly all of the Bush tax cuts permanent when they were up for reauthorization.\nBut for all the GOP bluster about this bill being a tax cut for the middle class, and for all the rhetoric about the false necessity of making tax cuts permanent, the bill would keep the corporate tax rates the same while putting the individual rates up for expiration. Because of those temporary cuts, the Joint Committee on Taxation, which scores tax legislation for Congress, found that most households earning less than $75,000 annually would pay higher taxes 10 years from now.\nJust before debate began\u00a0Friday\u00a0night, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said on the Senate floor that this day would be remembered as one of the \u201cgreat robberies in U.S. history.\u201d\nCORRECTION:\u00a0An earlier version of this story incorrectly reported that Toomey\u2019s Hillsdale carveout had been adopted. This story has also been updated to clarify which industry Fleischer says would benefit from Cornyn\u2019s amendment.\u00a0", "date": "\n12/02/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/senate-passes-tax-bill_n_5a21da79e4b0a02abe91412e", "tags": "passes tax \u201c middle cut rich cuts republicans \u2015 night massive senate bill said"}
