{"title": "Rex Tillerson and the Unraveling of the State Department", "content": "One afternoon in late September, I sat down with Rex Tillerson on what, in hindsight, may well have been his last comparatively normal day as secretary of state. It was a little more than 72 hours before President Donald Trump would take to Twitter to declare that Tillerson, his top diplomat, was \u201cwasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man,\u201d as the president now refers to the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, and admonish Tillerson: \u201cSave your energy Rex, we\u2019ll do what has to be done!\u201d Which was a few days before NBC News would report that Tillerson, after a July meeting with Trump, called the president a \u201cmoron\u201d and wanted to resign until Vice President Mike Pence talked him out of it. Which was just a couple hours before Tillerson would hold an extraordinary news conference in the State Department\u2019s Treaty Room \u2014 the magisterial, blue-walled chamber where secretaries of state typically greet foreign dignitaries \u2014 in order to tell reporters that Trump \u201cis smart\u201d; deny that he ever considered resigning; and refuse to answer a question about whether he had indeed called the president a moron.\nBut even before all that, sitting in a silk-upholstered chair in front of a fireplace in his office, his State Department-seal cuff links peeking out from the sleeves of his navy blue suit, the impossibility of Tillerson\u2019s assignment was apparent. He was about to embark on his third trip to Asia as secretary of state, part of his efforts to bring about a peaceful resolution to the North Korean nuclear crisis, so I asked him if Trump\u2019s tweets on the topic \u2014 threatening in August that \u201cmilitary solutions are now fully in place, locked and loaded,\u201d and in September that if the United States \u201cis forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy #NoKo\u201d \u2014 were in any way helpful to what he was trying to accomplish.\nTillerson let out a short sigh. \u201cLook, on the president\u2019s tweets,\u201d he said, \u201cI take what the president tweets out as his form of communicating, and I build it into my strategies and my tactics. How can I use that? How do I want to use that? And in a dynamic situation, like we deal with here all the time \u2014 and you can go walk around the world, they\u2019re all dynamic \u2014 things happen. You wake up the next morning, something\u2019s happened. I wake up the next morning, the president\u2019s got a tweet out there. So I think about, O.K., that\u2019s a new condition. How do I want to use that?\u201d Tillerson continued: \u201cOur strategies and the tactics we\u2019re using to advance the policies have to be resilient enough to accommodate unknowns, O.K.? So if you want to put that in an unknown category, you can. It certainly kind of comes out that even I would say, \u2018I wasn\u2019t expecting that.\u2019 But it doesn\u2019t mean our strategies are not resilient enough to accommodate it.\u201d\nAccommodating the president, rather than working with him, is not a normal mission for a secretary of state \u2014 and for Tillerson, it seems to be an increasingly doomed one. \u201cThe president\u2019s always saying, \u2018Rex\u2019s not tough,\u2019 and \u2018I didn\u2019t know he was so establishment,\u2019\u2009\u201d says one Trump adviser. After Tillerson\u2019s \u201cmoron\u201d gibe became public, the president, while dismissing the report as \u201cfake news, \u201d also told Forbes, \u201cif he did that, I guess we\u2019ll have to compare I.Q. tests. And I can tell you who is going to win.\u201d The question among many people inside and outside the Trump administration is not necessarily what\u2019s keeping Tillerson from resigning; it\u2019s what\u2019s stopping Trump from firing him. One Trump-administration official offered me a tentative theory: \u201cLosing a chief of staff in the first year is a big deal, but losing a secretary of state is an even bigger one.\u201d\nOn the afternoon I saw Tillerson at the State Department, he\u2019d just returned from several hours at the White House. This was hardly unusual. When he\u2019s in Washington, he often spends part of his workday at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, in formal and informal meetings with Trump. Tillerson, a former Eagle Scout who years later served as the Boy Scouts of America\u2019s national president, always comes prepared for those encounters, keeping a 2-inch-by-8-inch notecard in the inside pocket of his suit jacket with a handwritten list of matters he wants to discuss with the president. After meeting with Trump, he\u2019ll then add to the list the things Trump wants him to take care of.\nMany political eminences, including Tillerson\u2019s hunting buddy, the former Secretary of State James Baker, had advised Tillerson that his relationship with Trump would be the most important factor in determining his success in his new job. And this was an area in which Tillerson, in his previous job as chief executive of Exxon Mobil, had excelled. \u201cI have over my life had to build relationships with heads of state, not just this one, but heads of states all over the world,\u201d he reminded me. At Exxon Mobil, he did business with a rogue\u2019s gallery of world leaders, from Vladimir Putin (who in 2013 awarded Tillerson Russia\u2019s Order of Friendship) to Hugo Chavez (who in 2007 seized Exxon Mobil\u2019s assets, prompting the oil giant to leave Venezuela). I asked Tillerson if Trump had any similarities to the heads of state he dealt with as an oil executive. \u201cYeah, there are other leaders that share the qualities that he has,\u201d Tillerson replied, before adding, \u201cand I\u2019m not gonna name names, because then you\u2019ll go \u2014 everybody will go dissect that.\u201d\nBut building a good rapport with the head of state of his own country has, so far, proved to be beyond Tillerson\u2019s formidable abilities. According to some people who are close to Trump, his disappointment with Tillerson is as much personal as it is professional. \u201cTrump originally thought he could have a relationship with Tillerson that\u2019s almost social,\u201d says one Trump adviser, \u201cthe way his relationships are with Wilbur Ross and Steve Mnuchin.\u201d But unlike Trump\u2019s commerce and Treasury secretaries \u2014 plutocrats who, like Trump, are on their third, younger wives \u2014 Tillerson, who is 65 and has been married to the same woman for 31 years, has shown little interest in being the president\u2019s running buddy; instead of Saturday-night dinners with Trump at his Washington hotel, Tillerson favors trips home to Texas to see his grandchildren or to Colorado to visit his nonagenarian parents.\n(The White House, provided a detailed list of questions relating to Tillerson and his relationship with Trump as described in this article, responded with the following official statement: \u201cThe president has assembled the most talented cabinet in history and everyone continues to be dedicated towards advancing the president\u2019s America First agenda. Anything to the contrary is simply false and comes from unnamed sources who are either out of the loop or unwilling to turn the country around.\u201d)\nIn his office, Tillerson contemplated what has turned out to be his most difficult diplomatic mission. \u201cI\u2019ve had to build a relationship with President Trump because he didn\u2019t know me \u2014 I mean he certainly knew of me, just as I knew of him \u2014 but to understand how my thought processes work, for me to understand how his work, for me to understand how he makes decisions, because he makes decisions in a very different way than I do,\u201d Tillerson said, spinning his fingers around his head to indicate cognition. \u201cI\u2019m an engineer by training. I\u2019m a very systems, process, methodical decision maker. He\u2019s an entrepreneur. Different mind-set. He makes decisions differently. Doesn\u2019t mean one is better than the other, but I\u2019ve had to learn how he processes information and how I can help him process the information and how I can give him good advice that makes sense to him. So for both of us there\u2019s a communication to be worked out.\u201d\nAlthough the State Department is no longer quite the ivied redoubt it was a half-century ago, when men like George Kennan and Paul Nitze roamed the halls of Foggy Bottom and its global outposts, its employees still tend to be a bit tweedier than your ordinary government bureaucrat. This is especially true of the nearly 14,000 members of the Foreign Service, with their rigorous entrance exam and a strict up-or-out promotions system, not to mention their cosmopolitan ethos and fluency in multiple languages. They consider themselves elite.\nThis elite might have been more simpatico with President Barack Obama, given his appreciation of diplomacy and soft power, than with Trump, but neither of Obama\u2019s secretaries of state was particularly beloved by the department\u2019s rank and file. There were complaints that Hillary Clinton subordinated the department\u2019s needs to those of her political ambitions, creating a new and unwieldy cadre of special envoys and ambassadors at large that seemed designed to appeal to Democratic constituencies. Clinton\u2019s successor, John Kerry, was viewed by some as an imperious boss who treated the department as a kind of playground, bringing his yellow Labrador retriever to work and letting the dog roam the building\u2019s seventh-floor suite of executive offices known as Mahogany Row.\nBut after Trump\u2019s election, many State Department officials braced for much worse. Some of the initially rumored potential secretaries \u2014 John Bolton, Newt Gingrich, Rudy Giuliani \u2014 often seemed more inclined to blow up Foggy Bottom than to run it. When Trump picked Tillerson, the news was greeted not only with relief but even with optimism.\nIt was true that Tillerson was never going to be a conventional secretary of state, especially not working for Trump. \u201cHis idea for the job when he took it was that he and Trump can be negotiators, the best negotiators, for America,\u201d says a Trump adviser. \u201cHis idea of foreign policy isn\u2019t one that would make sense to people who read Foreign Policy.\u201d But his combed-back silver hair and Texas-inflected baritone \u2014 in which a Foggy Bottom commonplace like \u201cpartner\u201d becomes a mellifluous \u201cpardner\u201d \u2014 radiated the kind of authority admired by Trump, who asked Tillerson to be his secretary of state during their first meeting at Trump Tower in December. \u201cHe\u2019s much more than a business executive,\u201d Trump told Fox News shortly before announcing Tillerson\u2019s nomination. \u201cHe\u2019s a world-class player.\u201d Stephen K. Bannon, the former White House adviser who attended that first Trump-Tillerson meeting, says: \u201cThe president puts a ton of weight on first impressions. As soon as Rex walked in the room, I knew the job was his.\u201d\nTo external appearances, the work Tillerson did at Exxon Mobil seemed to reflect the zero-sum negotiator\u2019s view of foreign policy that Trump has espoused ever since \u201cThe Art of the Deal.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s led this charmed life,\u201d Trump said of Tillerson at a black-tie dinner in January. \u201cHe goes into a country, takes the oil, goes into another country.\u201d Tillerson\u2019s future employees took a different comfort in Tillerson\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9. As chief executive of Exxon Mobil, where he worked for 41 years, Tillerson led a nearly 75,000-person corporate behemoth with a global footprint that rivaled that of the United States itself, requiring it to have, in effect, its own foreign policy. In fact, Exxon Mobil operated its own sort of mini-State Department, a division called the International Government Relations Group, staffed with foreign-policy experts, including a number who previously served in high-ranking positions in Foggy Bottom. As Tillerson traveled the world cutting deals for Exxon Mobil in Russia and Africa and the Middle East, he relied on the I.G.R.G. for expertise and advice much the same way secretaries of state typically rely on the Foreign Service.\nTillerson was originally recommended to the Trump team by the former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and the former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, both mandarins of the Republican foreign-policy establishment who had consulted for Exxon Mobil, on the grounds that his vast knowledge of foreign governments and their leaders made him a perfect fit for the job. \u201cThe expectation was that Tillerson would be a grown-up and provide ballast,\u201d says a 30-year veteran of the Foreign Service, \u201cthat he was someone who believed in America being the glue that created global stability and would be interested in upholding the world order as we have it.\u201d\nBefore their Senate confirmations, secretary-of-state nominees are customarily provided a suite of offices on the first floor of the State Department\u2019s eight-story, limestone-and-steel headquarters. There, just off the international-flag-draped lobby on C Street, they prepare for their new job, receiving briefings from and meeting with some of the people they will soon be leading.\nTrump transition officials had sent a small beachhead team, led by Charles Glazer, a former Wall Street executive and Republican donor who served as President George W. Bush\u2019s ambassador to El Salvador, to use the office. Few saw Tillerson set foot in it. A space that could accommodate 50 people wound up being filled by not even a dozen. What\u2019s more, some State Department officials were told by the Trump transition team that they were not to contact Tillerson at all. \u201cThe attitude was that anyone who worked with Obama must be suspect,\u201d one Trump transition official says.\nIn December, Nikki Haley, Trump\u2019s nominee for ambassador to the United Nations, set up a conference call with two senior State Department officials: Kristie Kenney, the State Department counselor, and Patrick Kennedy, the under secretary of state for management. Haley wanted to ask them questions about the logistics of her new job: basic matters like what her salary and benefits would be and where her family would live in New York City. Kenney and Kennedy told her about the federal employee health insurance plan and offered to send her floor plans of the U.N. ambassador\u2019s apartment. When word of the call got back to Trump\u2019s transition team, the two department officials were reprimanded by Glazer and told never to speak with Haley again.\nKenney and Kennedy were among the small cohort of foreign-policy professionals who held the Foreign Service\u2019s equivalent of a three- or four-star general rank in the military. These senior diplomats were responsible for handling America\u2019s most vexing global challenges, everything from Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea to North Korea\u2019s pursuit of weapons of mass destruction to the Iran nuclear deal. Members of this elite group, who served under Democratic and Republican presidents alike, had submitted their pro forma letters of resignation upon the end of the Obama administration, as was the custom during presidential transitions. The letters typically occasion a conversation with the incoming secretary and his or her team about whether these diplomats should remain in their current jobs or, if not, what other senior positions inside the department they might be moved to. In a worst-case situation, they would usually be rotated into a sleepy ambassadorship.\nBut this time around, every letter was greeted with silence. Not only did the officials not know how Tillerson intended to use them; they didn\u2019t know if, come the Monday after Trump\u2019s Friday inauguration, they would even have jobs. As one of them later recalled, \u201cEvery conversation would end with, \u2018Have you heard anything from Tillerson?\u2019\u2009\u201d\nFinally, with only a few days until the inauguration and still no word from Tillerson, one of the senior officials, Victoria Nuland \u2014 who once was Hillary Clinton\u2019s State Department spokeswoman but had also been a foreign-policy adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney and was at the time the assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs \u2014 opted to retire. The others chose to make a go of it. On the Monday after the inauguration, they showed up for work, as usual, at Foggy Bottom.\nTwo days later, Kennedy was told to retire and given three days to clean out his office. Kennedy had spent 44 years in the Foreign Service and was not particularly political, focusing instead on management and operations; he\u2019d been appointed to his under-secretary position by President George W. Bush. But he had become a central figure in conservative conspiracy theories about Benghazi and Clinton\u2019s private email server. Tillerson aides later joked that Kennedy\u2019s defenestration was like something out of the Soviet Union, dragging a political foe out into the street and shooting him in the head so as to send a message to others.\nA few weeks later, Kenney, who as counselor was the State Department\u2019s No. 5 policy official, was told that her services were no longer needed, and she retired. And in the weeks after that, half a dozen other top diplomats were shown the door \u2014 fired, forced into retirement or warehoused at a university fellowship. \u201cIf you took the entire three-star and four-star corps of the military and said, \u2018Leave!\u2019 Congress would go crazy,\u201d one of the recently departed said.\nIn a few short months, Tillerson had rid the State Department of much of its last several decades of diplomatic experience, though it was not really clear to what end. The new secretary of state, it soon became evident, had an easier time firing people than hiring them \u2014 a consequence of the election that delivered him to Foggy Bottom.\nDuring the campaign, the \u201cNever Trump\u201d movement gathered many of its most devoted adherents from Republican foreign-policy circles, with scores of G.O.P. national-security professionals signing open letters declaring their opposition to the eventual Republican nominee. Although internecine foreign-policy squabbles were hardly unusual, they typically ended when the primaries did, with the losers rallying around the victor. But in 2016, representatives of all the various factions of the Republican foreign-policy world \u2014 realists and neoconservatives, hawks and isolationists \u2014 were united in their opposition to Trump, not only on ideological grounds but because they viewed him as personally unfit for office. And, given the personal nature of the criticism, Trump and those around him didn\u2019t forgive it.\nTillerson\u2019s early choice for deputy secretary of state was Elliott Abrams, a longtime Republican foreign-policy hand who served as George W. Bush\u2019s deputy national-security adviser. At Tillerson\u2019s instigation, Trump met with Abrams in early February and came away favorably disposed to his nomination, according to White House officials. But after the meeting, Trump apparently saw Rand Paul on Fox News disparage Abrams as a Never Trumper. (During the campaign Abrams wrote an article for The Weekly Standard titled \u201cWhen You Can\u2019t Stand Your Candidate.\u201d) Trump told Tillerson that Abrams could not work for him after all.\nAccording to a senior administration official, other potential hires were knocked out of consideration for sins as minor as retweeting some of Marco Rubio\u2019s \u201clittle hands\u201d jokes about Trump. \u201cThe hiring pool is very different from your normal hiring pool,\u201d the official says. \u201cThe people the Senate would expect to confirm have all been taken off the table.\u201d\nIn the early days of the administration, according to State Department officials, White House officials, especially Bannon, sent over many names for State Department posts. But Tillerson, after looking at their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and in some cases conducting interviews, felt he had no choice but to reject them. \u201cThey didn\u2019t meet the qualifications for the actual jobs,\u201d another senior administration official says.\nAmid this impasse, power in the State Department has accrued to the relative handful of figures who have actually been hired, like Tillerson\u2019s chief of staff, Margaret Peterlin. Peterlin served in the early 2000s as a national-security aide to Dennis Hastert, who was then speaker of the House, but she had been out of international-affairs work for more than a decade, first as a Commerce Department official, then as an executive for the Mars candy company before she left to raise her children. Peterlin was tapped by a Trump transition official, a fellow former Hastert staff member, to shepherd the secretary-of-state nominee through his confirmation process. Tillerson subsequently asked her to become his chief of staff.\nBy the spring, however, Peterlin had become a particular source of irritation to White House officials, some of whom told me they believed that she was dragging her feet on nominations in order to preserve her newfound power. In April, according to multiple sources, Reince Priebus, who was then chief of staff at the White House, went so far as to set up a weekly meeting among himself, Peterlin and the White House personnel director, Johnny DeStefano, to review applicants in the hope of moving things along.\nIn the past few months, the pace of nominations for the State Department has picked up. But even so, few of the nominees have qualifications that match those of their predecessors. For instance, Tillerson\u2019s nominee for under secretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs \u2014 a post that was held by the former White House senior adviser Karen Hughes during George W. Bush\u2019s administration and the former Time editor Richard Stengel during Obama\u2019s \u2014 is a New York City marketing executive named Irwin Steven Goldstein who once worked at the same company as Peterlin\u2019s husband.\nThe person on whose shoulders the fallout from the staffing shortage rests most heavily is Brian Hook, the head of the department\u2019s office of policy planning. A former adviser to Mitt Romney, Hook was a founder of the John Hay Initiative, a hawkish foreign-policy think tank whose other two founders, Eliot A. Cohen and Eric Edelman, were (and still are) among Trump\u2019s most vociferous critics. Cohen and Edelman put their names on anti-Trump letters during the 2016 election; Hook didn\u2019t.\nWith so many crucial assistant-secretary positions \u2014 including some responsible for Asia, the Middle East, and South America \u2014 still either vacant or filled with acting officials, Hook has had to pick up the slack. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to do the job of 30 people,\u201d a 25-year veteran Foreign Service officer says. \u201cHe\u2019s just knee-walking.\u201d Worse, the office of policy planning, which has traditionally functioned as the secretary of state\u2019s in-house think tank, is now tasked with handling day-to-day operations at the expense of formulating long-term strategy. \u201cThe problem is there\u2019s no conceptual motor at all,\u201d says Cohen, a professor at Johns Hopkins University\u2019s School of Advanced International Studies who served as counselor of the department under Rice. \u201cIt\u2019s the random thoughts of Donald J. Trump and a very weak State Department and a secretary of state who hasn\u2019t thought deeply about these things.\u201d\nWhen I recently met with Hook in his seventh-floor office at the State Department, he seemed wary of any implication that, in light of his establishment pedigree and association with Cohen and Edelman, he wasn\u2019t sufficiently pro-Trump. I noted that on his conference table he had a book by Daniel W. Drezner, an international-politics professor at Tufts University who writes regularly for The Washington Post website and is a frequent critic of Trump and of Tillerson. In fact, just that morning, Drezner had published a column calling on Tillerson to resign. I jokingly told Hook that he might want to hide the book. Instead, R.C. Hammond, Tillerson\u2019s communications director, who was sitting in on the interview, immediately seized it.\n\u201cThis is the guy who has the thing at The Post?\u201d Hammond asked Hook. \u201cWhere\u2019s your trash can?\u201d He made as if he was going to throw the book across Hook\u2019s office. Hook raised his hand to block Hammond.\n\u201cNo!\u201d Hook said. \u201cIt\u2019s a book on policy planning! This was written before Rex Tillerson was even considered.\u201d\n\u201cTrash can,\u201d Hammond reiterated. Hook kept his hand up. The fifth of Bombay gin and the liter bottle of tonic water on his desk suddenly made more sense.\nOn June 5, Tillerson was in Sydney, Australia, with the defense secretary, James Mattis, when he learned that Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt were all severing relations with the tiny Persian Gulf nation Qatar and imposing an air, sea and land blockade. The countries took these actions, they contended, because of Qatar\u2019s support for Islamist groups, like the Muslim Brotherhood, and its warm relations with Iran, with which it shares the world\u2019s largest gas field. But it was most likely not a coincidence that the move came on the heels of Trump\u2019s goofy and garish visit to Saudi Arabia, during which he was photographed laying hands on what appeared to be a mysterious glowing orb, announced a $110 billion arms deal and called for a Sunni alliance to combat terrorism and Iran.\nTillerson had participated in the festivities, joining Trump and their Saudi hosts in a ceremonial sword dance \u2014 \u201cnot my first sword dance,\u201d he later told reporters. But Qatar is also a country Tillerson knows well. At Exxon Mobil, he worked closely with its emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, who was then Qatar\u2019s interior minister, to help develop the world\u2019s largest liquefied-natural-gas complex in Ras Laffan Industrial City. He happened to be in Doha, on Exxon Mobil business, the night Trump was elected. According to Hammond, when Tillerson returned to the country for the first time as secretary of state, in July, he tapped Hammond on the shoulder as his airplane was making its approach and pointed down to Ras Laffan. \u201cDo you want to see what $250 billion looks like?\u201d Tillerson asked.\nTillerson feared the crisis could destabilize the region. Mattis, meanwhile, was concerned about the United States air base in Qatar that hosts the largest concentration of American military members in the Middle East. Together, the two cabinet secretaries began working to get Trump to try to broker a resolution.\nBut other members of the Trump administration argued against such a move, especially Jared Kushner. Ever since Trump\u2019s election, Kushner had been the focus of an intense courtship by Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, and Mohammed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi; and the two men quickly formed a close friendship with the president\u2019s son-in-law. So close, in fact, that the crown princes convinced Kushner not just of Qatar\u2019s perfidy but of the opportunity the blockade provided to further tilt American foreign policy toward the Saudis and away from Iran, according to the Trump adviser. \u201cRex saw it as a crisis to solve,\u201d the adviser says. \u201cJared saw it as an opportunity to seize.\u201d\nBack in Washington, Tillerson suggested summoning the parties to Camp David. When that idea gained no traction, Tillerson proposed an American-sponsored meeting in Kuwait, to no avail. While Tillerson publicly called on the Saudis to end their blockade, Trump pronounced the action against Qatar \u201chard but necessary.\u201d The \u201cspecial relationship of prince to prince,\u201d as the senior administration official describes the Kushner-Mohammed bin Salman alliance, seemed to be carrying the day.\nFinally, in mid-July, Trump acquiesced to Tillerson\u2019s request to be allowed to go to the region himself to conduct a round of shuttle diplomacy. In Doha, over a dinner of goat and baby camel, Tillerson negotiated with Qatar\u2019s emir. In Jidda, he cajoled the Saudis and their allies to end their blockade. Nothing seemed to work, especially because each side was receiving the opposite message from other officials in Washington. On his flight back to the United States, Tillerson vented some of his frustrations. \u201cIt is a lot different than being C.E.O. of Exxon because I was the ultimate decision maker,\u201d he told two reporters on board. The federal government, by contrast, is \u201cnot a highly disciplined organization, decision making is fragmented and sometimes people don\u2019t want to take decisions.\u201d\nBut Tillerson continued to quietly work the issue, concentrating as much on the head of state at home as on the heads of state in the gulf. When the quartet excluded Qatar from a military exercise in which it had traditionally taken part, he made a note of it on his list of things to talk to Trump about and brought it up to him at the White House. When Mohammed bin Salman welcomed a rogue member of Qatar\u2019s Al-Thani royal family to Mina, lending credence to Tillerson\u2019s suspicion that the Saudis hoped to use the crisis to engineer a regime change in Doha, Tillerson alerted Trump.\nAfter several months, Tillerson finally won Trump over to his view. In early September, Trump told the Saudis and the Qataris that it was time to end the dispute. After Trump brokered a call between the emir of Qatar and the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, the two sides immediately began fighting again, and the crisis remains unresolved, but at least it was a start.\nWhen I spoke to Tillerson about what caused the initial split in the administration on Qatar, he said that it boiled down to experience. \u201cI think I started from a different place perhaps because I\u2019ve known all the leaders involved for a long time, and I\u2019ve seen these kinds of issues emerge in the region over the 20-plus years I\u2019ve been dealing with the region,\u201d he said. \u201cSo this was not new for me, and so I guess my reaction to it was perhaps immediately measured because I\u2019ve seen it before. To those who have not seen it before\u201d \u2014 and here Tillerson didn\u2019t bother to name names, but it seemed he was talking about Kushner \u2014 \u201cthere are a lot of concerns expressed about Qatar that are legitimate concerns. The U.S. government has had some of these concerns, and we\u2019re addressing them now through the engagement with Qatar and the memorandum of understanding we put in place when I was over there, and it\u2019s going very well. We have issues with the other countries as well, and so I think the way we reacted was just based upon, in my case, that past experience versus those who perhaps had not seen this before.\u201d\nIt was amid the Qatar episode that, in July, Tillerson and Mattis convened a special meeting with Trump to give the president a tutorial on, as The Associated Press later described it, \u201cAmerican Power 101.\u201d Sitting in a windowless meeting room at the Pentagon known as the Tank, Tillerson and Mattis reportedly used charts and maps to explain to Trump why the United States needed to have so many diplomatic, military and intelligence assets deployed around the world. In at least one respect, their message had its intended effect: A month later, Trump would reverse his promise to withdraw from Afghanistan and announce that he was sending more troops there.\nBut when the meeting broke up, that development was hardly assured; and it was after spending 90 minutes tutoring Trump \u2014 including, according to NBC, about why the tenfold increase in nuclear weapons Trump desired would be a bad idea \u2014 that Tillerson reportedly called the president a \u201cmoron.\u201d It may well be the harshest criticism Tillerson has directed at his boss, but it\u2019s far from the only one. According to a former administration official, in private conversations with aides and friends, Tillerson refers to Trump, in his Texas deadpan, as the dealmaker in chief. And in meetings with Trump, according to people who have attended them, he increasingly rolls his eyes at the president\u2019s remarks. If Trump disagrees with Tillerson, the official said, his secretary of state will say, \u201cIt\u2019s your deal.\u201d\nThe friction hasn\u2019t been confined to foreign policy. In July, Tillerson was reportedly outraged by Trump\u2019s politically charged speech at the Boy Scout Jamboree in West Virginia, where, a few days earlier, Tillerson himself was honored for his service to the organization. In August, after Trump\u2019s response to a white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville \u2014 in which he said there were \u201cvery fine people\u201d on \u201cboth sides\u201d of the violent clashes there \u2014 Tillerson was asked on Fox News about whether the \u201cpresident\u2019s values\u201d reflected America\u2019s values. \u201cThe president speaks for himself,\u201d Tillerson replied.\nThe souring of Tillerson\u2019s relationship with Trump has left him not just without the support of the most crucial ally, his boss, but also without the support of any real allies at all. \u201cThe conundrum for Rex,\u201d says a Trump-administration official sympathetic to Tillerson\u2019s plight, \u201cis that he\u2019s on this island.\u201d\nDuring his first eight months in Washington, Tillerson spent so much time focusing his energies on Trump that he neglected other crucial constituencies. Bob Corker, the Republican senator from Tennessee who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has praised Tillerson \u2014 along with Mattis and the White House Chief of Staff John Kelly \u2014 for helping to \u201cseparate our country from chaos\u201d; but Tillerson has few other allies on Capitol Hill, and now that Corker\u2019s own relationship with Trump is on the rocks, it\u2019s unclear how much his support of Tillerson will mean. Nor has Tillerson developed any new, close ties with foreign leaders, and many of the ones he had from his days at Exxon are now complicated by the realities of his current job.\nHis interactions with the press, meanwhile, have been grudging at best. Previous secretaries of state traveled the globe on a Boeing 757 that could accommodate as many as a dozen members of the State Department press corps; Tillerson has usually opted to fly on a smaller 737, with very limited room for reporters, and has studiously avoided the media in Washington. He has been sparing with his major policy speeches. \u201cI speak when I have something I think\u2019s important to say,\u201d Tillerson told me. \u201cI don\u2019t need a lot of time talking to. ...\u201d He nodded curtly in my direction.\nAnd then, of course, there\u2019s Tillerson\u2019s relationship \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 with the State Department itself. For a secretary of state, speaking to the public, either in speeches or through regular interactions with the press, is a vital way of speaking to the department\u2019s employees, especially when the secretary is planning to upend their lives, as Tillerson currently is. Not long after he was sworn in last February, Tillerson announced that he would be undertaking a grand \u201credesign\u201d of the department. He hired a small consulting firm, Insigniam, that did work for him at Exxon Mobil to conduct a \u201clistening tour\u201d of State Department rank and file through an online questionnaire and about 300 personal interviews.\nMany State Department employees found that Insigniam\u2019s questions, both online and in person, betrayed a fundamental misunderstanding of what they did. \u201cThey came away with the impression that we\u2019re very \u2018patriotic\u2019 and \u2018professional,\u2019\u2009\u201d a senior State Department official says. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a [expletive] survey to know that. It\u2019s completely demeaning.\u201d\nAt the same time Tillerson was getting ready to carry out his redesign, he was also trying to accommodate the Trump administration\u2019s demand to drastically slash the State Department\u2019s budget, ultimately acquiescing to a 30 percent cut. Tillerson insists that one has nothing to do with the other. \u201cThe budget and what we\u2019re doing organizationally have no relationship whatsoever,\u201d he told me. But others inside and outside the State Department see them as inextricably linked. \u201cIt\u2019d be like Exxon Mobil starting with a budget number and then deciding if it was going to produce oil or gas,\u201d a former senior State Department official says.\nAlthough Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill have already declared Trump\u2019s State Department cuts a nonstarter \u2014 and, in September, passed an appropriations bill that funded the department for the next three months at about last year\u2019s level \u2014 Tillerson still intends to slash the department\u2019s staff by 8 percent, or roughly 2,000 people. According to one senior State Department official, Tillerson originally wanted to cut the staff by 15 percent, until he was told that to do so the State Department would have to fire people. (The 8 percent reduction will be accomplished through attrition and some buyouts.)\n\u201cI have just the utmost respect for the Foreign Service officer corps here, and they\u2019re vital,\u201d Tillerson told me. \u201cThey\u2019re vital and critical to the country\u2019s ability to carry out its foreign policies.\u201d As for the perception by many inside and outside Foggy Bottom that he wants to gut the Foreign Service, he said he doesn\u2019t quite know how to respond. \u201cI\u2019m mystified by it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m perplexed by it.\u201d\nBut even the cuts he has planned, some State Department veterans fear, will cripple the department for years to come, especially as the lower and midlevel ranks of the department are reduced. \u201cYou can\u2019t have captains if you don\u2019t have lieutenants,\u201d a senior State Department official says. \u201cYou can\u2019t have majors if you don\u2019t have captains.\u201d\nIn nearly 300 embassies, missions and consulates around the world where State Department officials work to promote and defend America\u2019s interests, diplomats complain about not just a dearth of resources but also a lack of guidance. \u201cI\u2019d request instructions on action items, saying I need a decision, and I\u2019d hear absolutely nothing,\u201d a recently returned ambassador said. Meanwhile, foreign leaders are increasingly emboldened in their attempts to drive a wedge between America\u2019s diplomatic corps and the president. Earlier this year, according to Foreign Policy, Trump pushed out the United States ambassador to Jordan at the request of the country\u2019s king. And this month, Turkey\u2019s president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has cultivated a close relationship with Trump, declared the American ambassador to his country persona non grata after a visa dispute. \u201cWe do not see him as the representative of the United States in Turkey,\u201d Erdogan said.\nA result, according to the nearly two dozen current and former State Department officials with whom I spoke, is that the department\u2019s morale has never been lower. For that, almost all of them blame Tillerson. \u201cWhen we\u2019re put up for confirmation and swearing in, we thank the president and the secretary of state for having confidence in us, but I\u2019m not sure I can honestly say that anymore,\u201d the 25-year veteran of the Foreign Service confessed. \u201cIt\u2019s not even about the president for me. It\u2019s that I am deeply, deeply anguished about the secretary of state, and I have never felt like that.\u201d\nAfter Tillerson\u2019s punishing turn in the media glare in recent weeks, the assumption among many that I spoke to in Foggy Bottom (outside Tillerson\u2019s closest advisers) was that his departure was now a question of when, not if. Some believed that the only holdup was that Trump had not yet decided on Tillerson\u2019s replacement, with Haley and the C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo, being the most frequently mentioned candidates. Others speculated that Tillerson had asked to delay his exit until he\u2019d been in his position for a year, in order to avoid a huge capital-gains tax hit on the stocks he had to divest from in order to take the job.\nThe \u201cmoron\u201d remark had actually elevated Tillerson in the estimation of some in Foggy Bottom \u2014 \u201cI feel like it\u2019s curiously redemptive,\u201d the 25-year veteran Foreign Service officer told me \u2014 but even these people conceded that they believed he could no longer do his job effectively. \u201cThis just isn\u2019t sustainable,\u201d a senior State Department official said. \u201cYou can\u2019t have a secretary of state going around the world who\u2019s not seen as representing the president\u2019s foreign policy.\u201d\nBut even if Tillerson leaves, the fear among many in the State Department is that the hangover from his tenure will be long-lasting. The Foreign Service officer recalls a recent meeting of acting assistant secretaries, where the most pressing matters discussed were the backlog of Freedom of Information Act requests and the number of typographical errors in memos to the secretary\u2019s office. \u201cThe world is going to hell in a handbasket,\u201d the Foreign Service officer fumed, \u201cand the greatest minds in our diplomatic service are talking about FOIA requests and [expletive] typos.\u201d\nAll of which can lead to some dark thoughts. More than one State Department official told me that they believed all of this wasn\u2019t a case of simple mismanagement but of something more sinister. \u201cI\u2019ve lived in a lot of countries where conspiracy theories abound because people feel like they lack self-determination,\u201d Nancy McEldowney, a 30-year career Foreign Service officer who retired in June, says. \u201cAnd a great many people inside State are now hypothesizing about what the goal of all this is. Why are they firing people and shrinking the department down? It can\u2019t simply be a budget-cutting exercise. If it were purely for reform, they would have done it differently.\u201d\nWhatever his intentions, Tillerson\u2019s true legacy may well be to have transformed a venerable American institution into the caricature of its most fevered, irrational critics. In Foggy Bottom, anguish is increasingly giving way to bitterness. \u201cI\u2019ve jokingly said to friends that I\u2019m going to be executive director of the Deep State,\u201d the Foreign Service veteran of 25 years, who is currently in the process of \u201cseparating\u201d from the organization, told me. \u201cThere was never a Deep State before, but these idiots have managed to create one.\u201d", "date": "Oct. 17, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/magazine/rex-tillerson-and-the-unraveling-of-the-state-department.html", "tags": "unraveling department secretary \u201d rex state foreign \u2014 tillerson"}
