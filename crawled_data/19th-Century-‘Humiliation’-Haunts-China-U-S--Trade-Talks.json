{"title": "19th-Century \u2018Humiliation\u2019 Haunts China-U.S. Trade Talks", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 When President Trump\u2019s trade team presented Chinese officials with a list of bold economic demands in Beijing last May, one of China\u2019s state-controlled news outlets, Global Times, panned the request and blared a curious headline: \u201cIs it now 1840?\u201d\nFive months later, China\u2019s national news agency, Xinhua, accused Vice President Mike Pence of lacking knowledge of China\u2019s past after he complained that Beijing was merely paying lip service to opening its economy.\nBehind the pushback is a long and painful history of China surrendering to Western powers, with origins in what the Chinese news media refers to as a \u201ccentury of humiliation\u201d that began with the \u201cunequal treaties\u201d of the 19th century after the first Opium War.\nHistory has been haunting trade negotiations between the world\u2019s two largest economies, which have dragged on for more than a year. While the administration\u2019s requests surrounding forced technology transfer and subsidies of state-owned enterprises remain unresolved, the deepest division centers on the United States\u2019 insistence of an enforcement mechanism that gives it power to impose tariffs if China abrogates its end of a trade agreement.\nThat issue is expected to be front and center on Thursday, when Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, and Robert Lighthizer, Mr. Trump\u2019s top trade negotiator, will again try to make headway toward a final deal during a two-day visit to Beijing. Next week, a delegation of government officials from China is scheduled to come to Washington for additional talks.\nAs they work to agree on trade terms, Trump administration officials have outlined various situations for enforcing an agreement. Most recently, negotiators have called for a system in which representatives from both countries would meet to address problems that arise, escalating complaints to the top levels of government as necessary.\nThe Chinese have agreed to periodic meetings at the levels of office director, vice minister and minister, which would allow the United States to keep tabs on China\u2019s behavior and air complaints from companies about unfair business practices. If China fails to keep its agreement, the United States would respond \u201cproportionally but unilaterally,\u201d Mr. Lighthizer said at a congressional hearing last month.\nRepublican lawmakers, who have been closely tracking the negotiations, say they expect enforcement to be a determining factor in whether a deal is reached.\n\u201cWhat we want is the ability to put on unilateral tariffs that can\u2019t be counteracted by a tariff from China,\u201d Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, told reporters on Wednesday.\nWhile Mr. Grassley said he was not sure whether such a request was a reasonable one to make, he said it was the goal of the Trump administration.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to have enforcement, one way or the other,\u201d he said, adding that China had a history of breaking promises on trade.\nBut China is resisting the Trump administration\u2019s demand that the United States be allowed to impose tariffs if Beijing fails to keep its promises and that China agree not to retaliate with its own punitive measures.\nThe Trump administration says such a mechanism is necessary to ensure that China lives up to its agreement and does not repeat what it says is a pattern of reneging on past promises. But such disarmament has proved to be unpalatable in China, in part, historians say, because of stinging memories of one-sided treaties from an earlier era.\n\u201cEvery schoolchild in China and every educated Chinese person knows about the \u2018century of humiliation,\u2019\u201d said Stephen R. Platt, a historian and author of \u201cImperial Twilight: The Opium War and the End of China\u2019s Last Golden Age.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a lingering memory of that history from the 19th century that goes a long way to explain the desire in China for a global trading order that works more on China\u2019s terms.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cThey have to look strong on trade.\u201d\nIn 1839, the big trade war that gripped the world was between Britain and China\u2019s Qing dynasty. Britain was buying large quantities of Chinese silk and tea, but China was buying little in return, creating an uncomfortably large trade deficit. So Britain turned to smuggling Indian opium, a product that proved hard to resist, into China, and its resistance turned a trade war into a real one.\nThe three-year war ended with the Treaty of Nanking, which gave Britain control of Hong Kong and opened several new trade ports in China. British merchants were allowed to come to China and trade freely with no restrictions.\nThat was just the beginning. By the 1850s, the United States, Russia and France signed treaties with China with the same terms, allowing foreigners to sell goods with low tariffs and giving them privileged status in mainland China. Rather than show respect for the superiority of Chinese culture, China was forced to adhere to the traditions of Western diplomacy. The influx of foreign culture reoriented China\u2019s economy, eventually leading to the dynasty\u2019s downfall in 1912.\nSome historians, such as William C. Kirby, a professor of Chinese studies at Harvard Business School, argue that the unequal treaties did have benefits for China such as modernizing its institutions and its education system. However, that does not always mean that trade pacts are mutually beneficial.\n\u201cOne should always be cautious that what is good for you, you imagine is good for the other party automatically,\u201d Mr. Kirby said. \u201cIt might be, it might not be.\u201d\nTrump administration officials have tried to make the case that the changes it wants China to make will benefit everyone.\n\u201cThe kinds of things that we\u2019re asking for are not anti-Chinese at all,\u201d Mr. Lighthizer told NPR this week. \u201cIn fact, the reformers would say it\u2019s pro-Chinese. It will help their economy, not hurt their economy.\u201d\nDespite suggesting that their interests are aligned, it has been difficult for the United States to push China to make changes without coming across as bullying or insensitive. After talks stalled in February, Larry Kudlow, the director of the White House\u2019s National Economic Council, said that Mr. Lighthizer read the \u201criot act\u201d to Liu He, China\u2019s vice premier and the country\u2019s top trade negotiator.\nIt has also been hard for the Trump administration to sell the agreement as being two-sided. Mr. Trump has accused China of essentially stealing from the United States for decades and his administration is demanding that China buy more American goods, stop subsidizing its own companies and treat foreign companies fairly. In return, the United States has so far offered to remove some, but not all, of the $250 billion worth of tariffs Mr. Trump imposed last year.\n\u201cI consider that we\u2019ve rebuilt China,\u201d Mr. Trump said last week at an event in Ohio. \u201c$500 billion a year taken out of our country,\u201d he said, referring to the amount of Chinese goods imported into the United States.\nChina remains skeptical that many of the concessions that Mr. Trump is asking for will really help uplift its economy.\nWhile old memories of humiliation might still be fresh in China\u2019s collective mind, its status in the world has changed drastically in the last 150 years. Now the world\u2019s second-largest economy, China has been exerting its own influence around the world.\nDevelopment programs like China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative, a global infrastructure investment plan, have drawn criticism from the United States and in parts of Europe for being insufficiently transparent and putting more vulnerable economies in precarious positions.\n\u201cChinese policy has shifted from fear of being bullied into unequal treaties into becoming a bully itself and forcing unequal agreements on weaker nations,\u201d said Michael Pillsbury, a China scholar at the Hudson Institute who advises the Trump administration.\nBut, Mr. Pillsbury points out, the Chinese do not see things that way when it comes to a trade deal with the United States. The Communist Party was founded nearly a century ago on a promise of putting a stop to humiliation at the hands of foreigners.\n\u201cThe Communist Party was created on a narrative of standing up to, and ending, unequal treaties,\u201d he said.", "date": "March 27, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/27/us/politics/china-opium-wars-trade-talks.html", "tags": "haunts \u2018 china-u.s. china united humiliation states \u201d chinese trade said talks"}
