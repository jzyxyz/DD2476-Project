{"title": "As Democrats Seek Senate Candidates, Here's The Rub- It's No Fun There These Days", "content": "Democrats are having trouble persuading some high-profile candidates to run for the Senate next year, as the party eyes a strong opportunity to claim its majority. Part of the problem may stem from the current state of the upper chamber.\nUnder Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Republicans seem to be interested in doing little else other than confirming President Donald Trump\u2019s judicial and executive branch nominees. Hopes for a big infrastructure package making it to Trump\u2019s desk are fading fast. So, too, are the chances for action on other issues like immigration, gun control or climate change.\nThis week marked two months since the Senate held a roll call vote on passage of any type of legislation. The dearth of floor activity has left Democrats complaining about self-described \u201cGrim Reaper\u201d McConnell and his majority turning the Senate into a \u201clegislative graveyard.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of reason to be excited about the Senate today,\u201d Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) lamented on Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019ve certainly become just an expensive lunch club. We vote on judges a few times a week and we have lunch together and we don\u2019t do anything else,\u201d\u00a0\nThe Senate is even struggling to perform basic functions that it traditionally accomplished in a bipartisan fashion, like approving aid to states hit by disasters. Some lawmakers worry that the partisan stalemate over disaster aid bodes poorly for talks over raising the debt limit in the fall.\nAgainst that backdrop, Democratic strategists keep getting bad news as they hunt for prospects who could give the party its best shot at winning the three or four seats it needs to control the Senate (the number depends on who wins the presidency).\nOn Tuesday, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock (D) became the latest potentially competitive Senate candidate to take a pass on such a race. Bullock instead decided to jump into the already crowded Democratic presidential field, following the lead of two others who some party leaders had hoped instead would make Senate bids \u2015 former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas and former Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado.\n\u201cIt says something about the Senate that so many Dems would rather undertake a long shot White House campaign than run for a Senate seat in their own state,\u201d tweeted Larry Sabato, the director for politics at the University of Virginia.\nThe party\u2019s Senate recruitment effort also was dealt blows when three other Democrats with seemingly promising political futures decided to take a pass on Senate races \u2015 former state lawmaker Stacey Abrams in Georgia, former Gov. Tom Vilsack in Iowa and state attorney general Josh Stein in North Carolina.\nBullock, as he approached the announcement of his presidential candidacy, made clear he had little interest in seeking a Senate seat, dismissing the chamber as a place where talking is valued more than taking action.\n\u201cCongress, as a whole, it\u2019s more about speeches than actually getting things done. I\u2019ve been frustrated by the hyper-partisanship. And I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s frustrated,\u201d he told HuffPost recently.\nBut many national Democratic operatives view the decision by Bullock and the others to forgo Senate runs as short-sighted, choices that could seriously hamper the party if it wins the White House in 2020 but doesn\u2019t control the Senate.\n\u201cThere are a number of Democratic presidential candidates who would do more of a service for their states and their party if they would run for the Senate,\u201d said Guy Cecil, the head of the powerful Democratic super PAC Priorities USA. \u201cClearly, Bullock would make the strongest candidate\u201d to challenge GOP Sen. Steve Daines in Montana next year.\u00a0\nIt remains too early to entirely write off Democratic recruitment efforts. Races in red states like Montana and Georgia were always going to be a reach for the party. Meanwhile, Democrats have already found a strong and well-known recruit \u2015 former astronaut Mark Kelly \u2015 to challenge GOP incumbent Martha McSally in Arizona, a seat they almost assuredly will need to flip to take control of the upper chamber. They also fielded Rep. Ben Ray Lujan, a member of House leadership,\u00a0for an open New Mexico Senate seat held by a Democrat, as well as several competitive candidates to challenge GOP incumbent Cory Gardner in Colorado.\nStill, Democrats acknowledge that part of the problem in finding good candidates is that life in McConnell\u2019s Senate just isn\u2019t that appealing. Ever since the GOP leader pushed through a rule change allowing for faster consideration of judicial and executive branch nominees, senators\u2019 days have been mostly filled with votes on Trump\u2019s picks to the courts and the administration.\n\u201cMcConnell has created a Senate no one could have possibly imagined, one that has no substantive agenda. It\u2019s a shame,\u201d said Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the chamber\u2019s No. 2 Democrat. \n\u201cPrivately, many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle tell me they\u2019re fed up with this,\u201d Durbin added. \u201cThe America I\u2019m looking at has a need for a lot of things that we should be doing on a bipartisan basis.\u201d\nSenate life also may not be too appealing for Republicans, either. Tuesday night, New Hampshire GOP Gov. Chris Sununu announced he would run for reelection instead of challenging Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen next year. New Hampshire\u2019s governorship typically isn\u2019t considered a great gig \u2015 the office\u2019s powers are limited, and it\u2019s up for election every two years.\nThe stakes for congressional Democrats in the 2020 election are huge. Even if they successfully defend the House majority they gained in the 2018 midterms, having\u00a0McConnell still in control of the Senate means a Democratic president would face the same problems that stymied President Barack Obama\u2019s second term.\nThe bitter partisan standoffs in recent years have led some advocates to call for structural reforms when the Democrats next retake the Senate,\u00a0 such as the complete elimination of the filibuster that gives the minority party the chance to bottle up certain measures. \n\u201cThe Senate is the \u2018this is fine\u2019 dog of American politics; anyone with eyes can see that it\u2019s a disaster but there\u2019s no sense of urgency from the inside to fix it,\u201d said Adam Jentleson, who served as a top aide to former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.). \n\u201cWe need talented people to run, for sure,\u201d Jentleson continued. \u201cBut convincing talented people to dedicate their careers to this broken institution requires laying out a plan for how to fix it so that big ideas can pass and we\u2019re not at the mercy of Mitch McConnell \u2015 which we will be for the foreseeable future unless we unite behind major reforms, fast.\u201d\nThis story has been updated with Sununu\u2019s decision to not run for the Senate.\n\u00a0", "date": "\n05/14/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/democrats-senate-2020-mcconnell_n_5cdb280ce4b03d0db31a0ed1", "tags": "fun candidates rub- democrats party run days \u201d \u2015 seek senate democratic mcconnell"}
