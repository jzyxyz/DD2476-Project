{"title": "Peter Thiel, Trump\u2019s Tech Pal, Explains Himself", "content": "Let others tremble at the thought that Donald J. Trump may go too far. Peter Thiel worries that Mr. Trump may not go far enough.\n\u201cEveryone says Trump is going to change everything way too much,\u201d says the famed venture capitalist, contrarian and member of the Trump transition team. \u201cWell, maybe Trump is going to change everything way too little. That seems like the much more plausible risk to me.\u201d\nMr. Thiel is comfortable being a walking oxymoron: He is driven to save the world from the apocalypse. Yet he helped boost the man regarded by many as a danger to the planet.\n\u201cThe election had an apocalyptic feel to it,\u201d says Mr. Thiel, wearing a gray Zegna suit and sipping white wine in a red leather booth at the Monkey Bar in Manhattan. \u201cThere was a way in which Trump was funny, so you could be apocalyptic and funny at the same time. It\u2019s a strange combination, but it\u2019s somehow very powerful psychologically.\u201d\nAt the recent meeting of tech executives at Trump Tower \u2014 orchestrated by Mr. Thiel \u2014 the president-elect caressed Mr. Thiel\u2019s hand so affectionately that body language experts went into a frenzy. I note that he looked uneasy being petted in front of his peers.\n\u201cI was thinking, \u2018I hope this doesn\u2019t look too weird on TV,\u2019\u201d he says.\nI ask if he had to twist arms to lure some of the anti-Trump tech titans, like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk.\n\u201cI think, early on, everybody was worried that they would be the only person to show up,\u201d Mr. Thiel says. \u201cAt the end, everybody was worried they would be the only person not to show up. I think the bigger tech companies all wanted to get a little bit off the ledge that they had gotten on.\n\u201cNormally, if you\u2019re a C.E.O. of a big company, you tend to be somewhat apolitical or politically pretty bland. But this year, it was this competition for who could be more anti-Trump. \u2018If Trump wins, I will eat my sock.\u2019 \u2018I will eat my shoe.\u2019 \u2018I will eat my shoe, and then I will walk barefoot to Mexico to emigrate and leave the country.\u2019\n\u201cSomehow, I think Silicon Valley got even more spun up than Manhattan. There were hedge fund people I spoke to about a week after the election. They hadn\u2019t supported Trump. But all of a sudden, they sort of changed their minds. The stock market went up, and they were like, \u2018Yes, actually, I don\u2019t understand why I was against him all year long.\u2019\u201d\nTalking about how the Billy Bush tape was not so shocking if you\u2019ve worked on the Wall Street trading floor, Mr. Thiel says: \u201cOn the one hand, the tape was clearly offensive and inappropriate. At the same time, I worry there\u2019s a part of Silicon Valley that is hyper-politically correct about sex. One of my friends has a theory that the rest of the country tolerates Silicon Valley because people there just don\u2019t have that much sex. They\u2019re not having that much fun.\u201d\nI note that several Silicon Valley companies have pre-emptively said they will not help build a Muslim registry for the Trump administration. Will Palantir, the data-mining company of which Mr. Thiel was a founder, and whose clients include the N.S.A., the C.I.A. and the F.B.I., be involved in that? (Palantir\u2019s C.E.O., Alex Karp, sat in at the Trump tech meeting.)\n\u201cWe would not do that,\u201d Mr. Thiel says flatly.\nWhen I ask him if he can explain to Mr. Trump that climate change is not a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese, he offers a Chinese box of an answer: \u201cDoes he really think that? If he really thinks that, how would you influence that? If he really thinks that and you could influence him, what would be the best way to do it?\u201d\n\nOne could have predicted Mr. Thiel\u2019s affinity for Mr. Trump by reading his 2014 book, \u201cZero to One,\u201d in which he offers three prongs of his philosophy: 1) It is better to risk boldness than triviality. 2) A bad plan is better than no plan. 3) Sales matter just as much as product.\nBut he was portrayed as an outcast in Silicon Valley and denounced as a jerk for supporting Mr. Trump and giving him $1.25 million. \u201cI didn\u2019t give him any money for a long time because I didn\u2019t think it mattered, and then the campaign asked me to,\u201d he says.\nHis critics demanded to know how someone who immigrated from Frankfurt to Cleveland as a child could support a campaign so bristling with intolerance. How could a gay man back someone who will probably nominate Supreme Court justices inclined to limit rights for gays and women? How could a futurist support a cave man who champions fossil fuels, puts profits over environmental protection and insists that we can turn back the clock on the effects of globalization on American workers?\n\u201cThere are reduced expectations for the younger generation, and this is the first time this has happened in American history,\u201d Mr. Thiel says. \u201cEven if there are aspects of Trump that are retro and that seem to be going back to the past, I think a lot of people want to go back to a past that was futuristic \u2014 \u2018The Jetsons,\u2019 \u2018Star Trek.\u2019 They\u2019re dated but futuristic.\u201d\nIt is a theme he has struck before, that Silicon Valley has not fulfilled the old dreams for bigger things. \u201cCellphones distract us from the fact that the subways are 100 years old,\u201d he says.\nAn article entitled \u201cPeter Thiel Is Poised to Become a National Villain,\u201d in New York magazine, suggested he looked like he is enjoying that role.\nHe says he isn\u2019t. Yet the billionaire views the visceral torrent against him with his usual rationality, surveying the scene deliberately, like the chess prodigy he once was. \u201cI was surprised that it generated as much controversy as it did,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was a push to remove me from the board of Facebook, which is kind of crazy, since I\u2019m the longest-serving director there after Zuckerberg.\u201d\nHe recalls that he went through a lot of \u201cmeta\u201d debates about Mr. Trump in Silicon Valley. \u201cOne of my good friends said, \u2018Peter, do you realize how crazy this is, how everybody thinks this is crazy?\u2019 I was like: \u2018Well, why am I wrong? What\u2019s substantively wrong with this?\u2019 And it all got referred back to \u2018Everybody thinks Trump\u2019s really crazy.\u2019 So it\u2019s like there\u2019s a shortcut, which is: \u2018I don\u2019t need to explain it. It\u2019s good enough that everybody thinks something. If everybody thinks this is crazy, I don\u2019t even have to explain to you why it\u2019s crazy. You should just change your mind.\u2019\u201d\nOn the Russian hacking, Mr. Thiel says: \u201cThere\u2019s a strong circumstantial case that Russia did this thing. On the other hand, I was totally convinced that there were W.M.D.s in Iraq in 2002, 2003.\u201d\nThe reaction from the gay community has been harsh, with one writer in The Advocate going so far as to suggest that Mr. Thiel was not even a gay man, because he did not \u201cembrace the struggle.\u201d\n\u201cI think Trump is very good on gay rights,\u201d Mr. Thiel says. \u201cI don\u2019t think he will reverse anything. I would obviously be concerned if I thought otherwise.\u201d\nI ask if he\u2019s comfortable with the idea that Vice President-elect Mike Pence, regarded in the gay community as an unreconstructed homophobe, is a heartbeat away from the presidency.\n\u201cYou know, maybe I should be worried but I\u2019m not that worried about it,\u201d he replies. \u201cI don\u2019t know. People know too many gay people. There are just all these ways I think stuff has just shifted. For speaking at the Republican convention, I got attacked way more by liberal gay people than by conservative Christian people.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think these things will particularly change. It\u2019s like, even if you appointed a whole series of conservative Supreme Court justices, I\u2019m not sure that Roe v. Wade would get overturned, ever. I don\u2019t know if people even care about the Supreme Court. You know, you\u2019d have thought the failure to have a vote on Merrick [Garland] would be a massive issue. And somehow it mattered to Democrats, but it didn\u2019t matter to the public at large.\u201d\nWould he like to get married and have kids?\nHe looks a bit startled by the question, then says: \u201cMaybe.\u201d\nI ask him if he worries about the bromance with Vladimir V. Putin and Mr. Trump\u2019s bizarre affinity for dictators. \u201cBut should Russia be allied with the West or with China?\u201d Mr. Thiel says. \u201cThere are these really bad dictators in the Middle East, and we got rid of them and in many cases there\u2019s even worse chaos.\u201d\nSo he doesn\u2019t worry about Mr. Trump sending an intemperate tweet and spurring a war with North Korea?\n\u201cA Twitter war is not a real war,\u201d Mr. Thiel says.\nIf the worst fears of annihilation seem plausible, Mr. Thiel can always invest more in his libertarian fantasy of a new society of Seasteads: islands at sea with their own rules, starting with a French Polynesian lagoon. \u201cThey\u2019re not quite feasible from an engineering perspective,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s still very far in the future.\u201d\nHe does think, though, that human violence is more of a risk than a pandemic or robot army. \u201cIt\u2019s the people behind the red-eyed robots that you need to be scared of,\u201d he says.\nMr. Thiel is focused on ways to prolong life. He was intrigued by parabiosis, a blood regeneration trial in which people over 35 would receive transfusions from people aged 16 to 25 \u2014 an experiment that Anne Rice gave a thumbs up to.\n\u201cOut of all the crazy things in this campaign, the vampire accusations were the craziest,\u201d he says, adding that while blood transfusions may be helpful, there may be harmful factors and \u201cwe have to be very careful.\u201d\n\u201cI have not done anything of the sort\u201d yet, he says about parabiosis. And because of the publicity, he says, he is now sifting through hundreds of proposals he has received from parabiosis ventures.\nMr. Thiel has, however, used human growth hormones and he has signed up for cryogenics. \u201cWe have to be more experimental in all our medical procedures,\u201d he says. \u201cWe should not go gently into that good night.\u201d\nI ask why everyone in Silicon Valley seemed so obsessed with immortality.\n\u201cWhy is everyone else so indifferent about their mortality?\u201d he replies.\nHe has invested in many biotech companies and has been advising the Trump transition team on science. \u201cScience is technology\u2019s older brother who has fallen on hard times,\u201d he says. \u201cI have some strong opinions on this. At the F.D.A. today, aging is still not an indication for disease. And you\u2019re not allowed to develop drugs that could stop aging. We have not even started yet.\u201d\nGiven the passion of his friend Mr. Musk for colonizing Mars, has he influenced Trump\u2019s thinking about NASA?\n\u201cIt\u2019s this very large agency that has kind of lost its way over the last 30 to 40 years,\u201d Mr. Thiel says. \u201cWhen we went to the moon, it took less than a decade from the time Kennedy announced it to the time we got there. Mars is harder but surely possible.\u201d\nHe says Mr. Trump\u2019s foes want to cast the president-elect \u201cas this uniquely evil person, Trump as Hitler; that doesn\u2019t strike me as remotely plausible.\u201d\n\nOver a four-hour dinner of duck and chocolate dessert \u2014 a surprisingly sybaritic meal for a man who admits he is prone to weird diets \u2014 Mr. Thiel shows, again and again, how he likes to \u201cflip around\u201d issues to see if conventional wisdom is wrong, a technique he calls Pyrrhonian skepticism.\n\u201cMaybe I do always have this background program running where I\u2019m trying to think of, \u2018O.K., what\u2019s the opposite of what you\u2019re saying?\u2019 and then I\u2019ll try that,\u201d he says. \u201cIt works surprisingly often.\u201d He has even wondered if his most famous investment, Facebook, contributes to herd mentality.\nWhen I remark that President Obama had eight years without any ethical shadiness, Mr. Thiel flips it, noting: \u201cBut there\u2019s a point where no corruption can be a bad thing. It can mean that things are too boring.\u201d\nWhen I ask if he is concerned about conflicts of interest, either for himself or the Trump children, who sat in on the tech meeting, he flips that one, too: \u201cI don\u2019t want to dismiss ethical concerns here, but I worry that \u2018conflict of interest\u2019 gets overly weaponized in our politics. I think in many cases, when there\u2019s a conflict of interest, it\u2019s an indication that someone understands something way better than if there\u2019s no conflict of interest. If there\u2019s no conflict of interest, it\u2019s often because you\u2019re just not interested.\u201d\nWhen I ask if Mr. Trump is \u201ccasting\u201d cabinet members based on looks, Mr. Thiel challenges me: \u201cYou\u2019re assuming that Trump thinks they matter too much. And maybe everyone else thinks they matter too little. Do you want America\u2019s leading diplomat to look like a diplomat? Do you want the secretary of defense to look like a tough general, so maybe we don\u2019t have to go on offense and we can stay on defense? I don\u2019t know.\u201d\nWhen I ask about the incestuous amplification of the Facebook news feed, he muses: \u201cThere\u2019s nobody you know who knows anybody. There\u2019s nobody you know who knows anybody who knows anybody, ad infinitum.\u201d\nMr. Thiel and Mr. Trump are strange bedfellows, given that much of Mr. Thiel\u2019s billions came from being one of the original investors in Facebook and Mr. Trump recently said it\u2019s better to send important messages by courier. (\u201cWell,\u201d Mr. Thiel notes, \u201cone does have to be very careful with what one says in an email.\u201d)\nThe 70-year-old president-elect rose by wildly lunging with his Twitter rapier in an \u201cunpresidented\u201d way in the first campaign that blended politics, social media and reality. But the 49-year-old social-media visionary rarely updates his Facebook page and doesn\u2019t tweet, \u201cbecause you always want to get things exactly right\u201d and \u201cif you start doing it, you have to do it a lot.\u201d\nAs Silicon Valley has devolved into a place that produces apps like one that sends the word \u201cYo,\u201d Mr. Thiel worries its thinking is \u201cnot big enough to take our civilization to the next level.\u201d\nWhen I ask if it is true that Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, wasn\u2019t invited to the Trump tech meeting because the Trump camp was angry that Twitter wouldn\u2019t let the Republican nominee create a \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d emoji, Mr. Thiel replies that \u201cthere were people upset about that,\u201d but that he set up the meeting according to the market caps of the bigger tech companies.\n\u201cI think the crazy thing is,\u201d he says, \u201cat a place like Twitter, they were all working for Trump this whole year even though they thought they were working for Sanders.\u201d\nMr. Thiel says he fell into his role in the Trump candidacy.\n\u201cIt was one of my friends who called me up and said, \u2018Hey, would you like to be a delegate at the Republican convention?\u201d\u2019 he recalls. \u201cI said: \u2018Actually, I kind of would. I think it would be fun to go.\u2019 Then, two weeks before the election, they talked to me about speaking at the convention.\u201d\nI note that the audience in his hometown, Cleveland, gave him a great reception when he appeared as only the third openly gay speaker at a Republican convention.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure that my speech was that good,\u201d he says. \u201cI do think a lot of other speeches were just very bad.\u201d\nHe had his first conversation with the man whom he sometimes calls \u201cMr. Trump\u201d at the convention, when the Manhattan mogul told the San Francisco mogul, \u201cYou were terrific. We\u2019re friends for life.\u201d Mr. Thiel never did go to a Trump rally or watch a whole video of one. \u201cI would think they were very repetitive,\u201d he says.\nHe says that at the tech meeting, Mr. Trump showed \u201ca phenomenal understanding of people. He\u2019s very charismatic, but it\u2019s because he sort of knows exactly what to say to different people to put them at ease.\u201d\nI ask him if Mr. Trump and Mr. Musk are similar.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to get in trouble, but they are, actually. They\u2019re both grandmaster-level salespeople and these very much larger-than-life figures.\u201d\nHe recalls a story from his and Mr. Musk\u2019s PayPal days, when Mr. Musk joined the engineering team\u2019s poker game and bet everything on every hand, admitting only afterward that it was his first time playing poker. Then there was the time they were driving in Mr. Musk\u2019s McLaren F1 car, \u201cthe fastest car in the world.\u201d It hit an embankment, achieved liftoff, made a 360-degree horizontal turn, crashed and was destroyed.\n\u201cIt was a miracle neither of us were hurt,\u201d Mr. Thiel says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t wearing a seatbelt, which is not advisable. Elon\u2019s first comment was, \u2018Wow, Peter, that was really intense.\u2019 And then it was: \u2018You know, I had read all these stories about people who made money and bought sports cars and crashed them. But I knew it would never happen to me, so I didn\u2019t get any insurance.\u2019 And then we hitchhiked the rest of the way to the meeting.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump, with his litigious streak and his pugilistic attitude toward the press and his threat to change the libel laws, naturally admired Mr. Thiel\u2019s legal smackdown of Gawker. The tech titan was disturbed by the \u201cpainful and paralyzing\u201d stories published on the gossipy website and other blogs under the Gawker banner, including a 2007 post that originally appeared on Valleywag blithely headlined \u201cPeter Thiel Is Totally Gay, People.\u201d\nSo he secretly financed the lawsuit filed by Terry Bollea (the real name of the wrestler Hulk Hogan) against Gawker for posting an excerpt from a sex tape showing Mr. Hogan with a friend\u2019s wife. A court ruled in Mr. Bollea\u2019s favor, in a judgment of $140 million, which drove the site into bankruptcy. (The Gawker founder Nick Denton, who is also gay, described Mr. Thiel to Vanity Fair as \u201cinteresting \u2014 and scary.\u201d)\n\u201cIt basically stands for the narrow proposition that you should not publish a sex tape,\u201d Mr. Thiel says. \u201cI think that\u2019s an insult to journalists to suggest that\u2019s journalism now. Transparency is good, but at some point it can go in this very toxic direction.\u201d\nJust as there was \u201ca self-fulfilling Hillary bubble\u201d where \u201ceverybody was just too scared to say this was a really bad idea\u201d to support this \u201cvery weak candidate,\u201d Mr. Thiel believes Gawker manufactured \u201ca totally insane bubble full of somewhat sociopathic people in New York.\u201d When the case went to court in Florida, he contends, the culture that \u201cyou could do whatever you wanted and there were no consequences\u201d was exposed.\nSavoring his victory, dismissing those who think the way to deal with vile and invasive stories is to grow a thicker skin, Mr. Thiel dressed as Hulk Hogan for the \u201cVillains and Heroes\u201d annual costume party last month, hosted on Long Island by the Mercer family, who were big Trump donors. He shows me a picture on his phone of him posing with Erik Prince, who founded the private military company Blackwater, and Mr. Trump \u2014 who had no costume \u2014 but jokes that it was \u201cN.S.F.I.\u201d (Not Safe for the Internet.)\n\u201cThere\u2019s some resonances between Hogan beating Gawker and Trump beating the establishment in this country,\u201d Mr. Thiel says. Hulk Hogan was \u201cthis crazy person\u201d who didn\u2019t seem like the best plaintiff, but \u201che didn\u2019t give up.\u201d\nUsing two wrestling terms he learned, Mr. Thiel says that many people assumed Mr. Trump was \u201ckayfabe\u201d \u2014 a move that looks real but is fake. But then his campaign turned into a \u201cshoot\u201d \u2014 the word for an unscripted move that suddenly becomes real.\n\u201cPeople thought the whole Trump thing was fake, that it wasn\u2019t going to go anywhere, that it was the most ridiculous thing imaginable, and then somehow he won, like Hogan did,\u201d Mr. Thiel says. \u201cAnd what I wonder is, whether maybe pro wrestling is one of the most real things we have in our society and what\u2019s really disturbing is that the other stuff is much more fake. And whatever the superficialities of Mr. Trump might be, he was more authentic than the other politicians. He sort of talked in a way like ordinary people talk. It was not sort of this Orwellian newspeak jargon that so many of the candidates use. So he was sort of real. He actually wanted to win.\u201d\nI ask Mr. Thiel about a prescient theory he proffered when I had dinner with him at the convention \u2014 again, flipping conventional wisdom \u2014 that Hillary was making a mistake by being too optimistic.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re too optimistic, it sounds like you\u2019re out of touch,\u201d he says. \u201cThe Republicans needed a far more pessimistic candidate. Somehow, what was unusual about Trump is, he was very pessimistic but it still had an energizing aspect to it.\u201d\nHe says he has no plans to buy a place in Washington. \u201cOne of the things that\u2019s striking about talking to people who are politically working in D.C. is, it\u2019s so hard to tell what any of them actually do,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a sort of place where people measure input, not output. You have a 15-minute monologue describing a 15-page r\u00e9sum\u00e9, starting in seventh grade.\u201d\nWhile many predict that Mr. Trump will crash and burn, Mr. Thiel does not think he will regret his role.\n\u201cI always have very low expectations, so I\u2019m rarely disappointed,\u201d he says.\nI ask him how Mr. Trump, who is still putting out a lot of wacky, childish tweets, has struck him during the transition. Isn\u2019t he running around with his hair on fire?\n\u201cThe hair seems fine,\u201d Mr. Thiel says. \u201cMr. Trump seems fine.\u201d", "date": "Jan. 11, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/11/fashion/peter-thiel-donald-trump-silicon-valley-technology-gawker.html", "tags": "think \u2018 thiel explains peter tech \u201d trump says like pal"}
