Previous work had focused on estimating the damage if average temperatures were to rise by a larger number, 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius), because that was the threshold scientists previously considered for the most severe effects of climate change. \nThe new report, however, shows that many of those effects will come much sooner, at the 2.7-degree mark.\nAvoiding the most serious damage requires transforming the world economy within just a few years, said the authors, who estimate that the damage would come at a cost of $54 trillion. But while they conclude that it is technically possible to achieve the rapid changes required to avoid 2.7 degrees of warming, they concede that it may be politically unlikely. \n[How much hotter is your hometown today than when you were born?

But such a move would be almost politically impossible in the United States, the world\u2019s largest economy and second-largest greenhouse gas emitter behind China. Lawmakers around the world, including in China, the European Union and California, have enacted carbon pricing programs.\nPresident Trump, who has mocked the science of human-caused climate change, has vowed to increase the burning of coal and said he intends to withdraw from the Paris agreement. And on Sunday in Brazil, the world\u2019s seventh-largest emitter of greenhouse gas, voters appeared on track to elect a new president, Jair Bolsonaro, who has said he also plans to withdraw from the accord. \nThe report was written and edited by 91 scientists from 40 countries who analyzed more than 6,000 scientific studies. The Paris agreement set out to prevent warming of more than 3.6 degrees above preindustrial levels \u2014 long considered a threshold for the most severe social and economic damage from climate change. But the heads of small island nations, fearful of rising sea levels, had also asked scientists to examine the effects of 2.7 degrees of warming.\n[What on Earth is going on?

It also found that, by 2050, use of coal as an electricity source would have to drop from nearly 40 percent today to between 1 and 7 percent. Renewable energy such as wind and solar, which make up about 20 percent of the electricity mix today, would have to increase to as much as 67 percent.\n\u201cThis report makes it clear: There is no way to mitigate climate change without getting rid of coal,\u201d said Drew Shindell, a climate scientist at Duke University and an author of the report.\nThe World Coal Association disputed the conclusion that stopping global warming calls for an end of coal use. In a statement, Katie Warrick, its interim chief executive, noted that forecasts from the International Energy Agency, a global analysis organization, \u201ccontinue to see a role for coal for the foreseeable future.\u201d\nMs. Warrick said her organization intends to campaign for governments to invest in carbon capture technology. Such technology, which is currently too expensive for commercial use, could allow coal to continue to be widely used.\nDespite the controversial policy implications, the United States delegation joined more than 180 countries on Saturday in accepting the report\u2019s summary for policymakers, while walking a delicate diplomatic line. A State Department statement said that \u201cacceptance of this report by the panel does not imply endorsement by the United States of the specific findings or underlying contents of the report.\u201d\nThe State Department delegation faced a conundrum. Refusing to approve the document would place the United States at odds with many nations and show it rejecting established academic science on the world stage. However, the delegation also represents a president who has rejected climate science and climate policy.\n\u201cWe reiterate that the United States intends to withdraw from the Paris agreement at the earliest opportunity absent the identification of terms that are better for the American people,\u201d the statement said.\nThe report attempts to put a price tag on the effects of climate change. The estimated $54 trillion in damage from 2.7 degrees of warming would grow to $69 trillion if the world continues to warm by 3.6 degrees and beyond, the report found, although it does not specify the length of time represented by those costs.\nThe report concludes that the world is already more than halfway to the 2.7-degree mark. Human activities have caused warming of about 1.8 degrees since about the 1850s, the beginning of large-scale industrial coal burning, the report found.\nThe United States is not alone in failing to reduce emissions enough to prevent the worst effects of climate change. The report concluded that the greenhouse gas reduction pledges put forth under the Paris agreement will not be enough to avoid 3.6 degrees of warming.\nThe report emphasizes the potential role of a tax on carbon dioxide emissions. \u201cA price on carbon is central to prompt mitigation,\u201d the report concludes. It estimates that to be effective, such a price would have to range from $135 to $5,500 per ton of carbon dioxide pollution in 2030, and from $690 to $27,000 per ton by 2100. \nBy comparison, under the Obama administration, government economists estimated that an appropriate price on carbon would be in the range of $50 per ton. Under the Trump administration, that figure was lowered to about $7 per ton.\nAmericans for Prosperity, the political advocacy group funded by the libertarian billionaires Charles and David Koch, has made a point of campaigning against politicians who support a carbon tax. \n\u201cCarbon taxes are political poison because they increase gas prices and electric rates,\u201d said Myron Ebell, who heads the energy program at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, an industry-funded Washington research organization, and who led the Trump administration\u2019s transition at the Environmental Protection Agency.\nThe report details the economic damage expected should governments fail to enact policies to reduce emissions. The United States, it said, could lose roughly 1.2 percent of gross domestic product for every 1.8 degrees of warming.\nIn addition, it said, the United States along with Bangladesh, China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Japan, the Philippines and Vietnam are home to 50 million people who will be exposed to the effects of increased coastal flooding by 2040, if 2.7 degrees of warming occur.\nAt 3.6 degrees of warming, the report predicts a \u201cdisproportionately rapid evacuation\u201d of people from the tropics. \u201cIn some parts of the world, national borders will become irrelevant,\u201d said Aromar Revi, director of the Indian Institute for Human Settlements and an author of the report. \u201cYou can set up a wall to try to contain 10,000 and 20,000 and one million people, but not 10 million.\u201d\nThe report also finds that, in the likelihood that governments fail to avert 2.7 degrees of warming, another scenario is possible: The world could overshoot that target, heat up by more than 3.6 degrees, and then through a combination of lowering emissions and deploying carbon capture technology, bring the temperature back down below the 2.7-degree threshold.\nIn that scenario, some damage would be irreversible, the report found. All coral reefs would die. However, the sea ice that would disappear in the hotter scenario would return once temperatures had cooled off.\n\u201cFor governments, the idea of overshooting the target but then coming back to it is attractive because then they don\u2019t have to make such rapid changes,\u201d Dr. Shindell said. \u201cBut it has a lot of disadvantages.\u201d\nFor more news on climate and the environment, follow @NYTClimate on Twitter.", "date": "Oct. 7, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/07/climate/ipcc-climate-report-2040.html", "tags": "describes world report early strong united \u201d warming climate risk crisis degrees major"}
