{"title": "Superiority Burger, a Vegetarian Ode to White Castle in the East Village", "content": "Is there such a thing as vegetarian food for carnivores? Superiority Burger, which opened near Tompkins Square in June, is a shoebox-size, white-tiled ode to White Castle, with a chef who comes from the tonier, meat-oriented Del Posto. The new restaurant\u2019s name alone would seem likely to deter the quinoa-faithful.\n\u201cThis is what I always wanted to do: very accessible vegetarian food,\u201d said Brooks Headley, one of the restaurant\u2019s partners, who previously sneaked vegetables like eggplants and celery into the desserts he made as pastry chef at Del Posto. Superiority Burger, which is open for dinner from Thursdays to Mondays, has almost enough tables to seat the Brady Bunch; most people take their food to go. Most dishes on the tiny menu come in either vegetarian or vegan mode.\nIN THE SEATS Meat-eating breeders! Mamie-Claire Cornelius and her husband, Rob Laakso, perched at a bench table by the front window, two days after the due date for their first child. Mr. Laakso fetched his wife lemon water from a jug. The couple, who live in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, stopped in after wandering around the neighborhood. \u201cThis is our last meal, we figure, before the baby comes,\u201d said Ms. Cornelius, 34, who works on postproduction on films. Mr. Laakso, 36, plays guitar in the band Kurt Vile and the Violators. \u201cI was like, it might be a while before we have a chance to come out again,\u201d he said.\nON THE PLATES For nonvegetarians, the couple went deep into the small menu. Each had a meatless Superiority Burger ($6), and they shared an order of kohlrabi and apple slaw ($5) and a vegan Philadelphia cheese steak ($5). (Since the cheese steak has neither cheese nor steak, perhaps we should make it clear that it\u2019s seared yuba, green peppers and onions, and a cashew-based vegan pump cheese.)\nFinally, Mr. Headley emerged from behind the counter with a dish of seared Romano beans ($5). \u201cThey\u2019re supposed to be like French fries, with salt and vinegar,\u201d he said. Ms. Cornelius approved. \u201cThe baby\u2019s kicking about that,\u201d she said.\nThey did not worry that the meal might induce childbirth. \u201cThat\u2019d be great if it did,\u201d Ms. Cornelius said. Her husband agreed, saying, \u201cIt\u2019d be a good last supper at the very least.\u201d\nWHAT THEY TALKED ABOUT Surely they talked about schemes to get their future child into the right preschool, right? Wrong. \u201cI think we\u2019re O.K.,\u201d Ms. Cornelius said. \u201cWe\u2019re just kind of waiting.\u201d\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s telling us to go out and enjoy ourselves, so that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Mr. Laakso added.\nIn lieu of preparental hand-wringing, Ms. Cornelius said they talked about \u201chow cute the tables were.\u201d She added, \u201cAnd the usage of space is really smart.\u201d The sound system segued from \u201cWarrior in Woolworths,\u201d by the 1970s British punk band X-Ray Spex, to the Velvet Underground singing \u201cHead Held High\u201d (nothing says indie insouciance like a conspicuously weak Velvet Underground song).\nMs. Cornelius finally broke down and admitted that they had talked about celebrity birthdays that their baby might share. \u201cYesterday,\u201d she said, \u201cwas Keith Moon.\u201d Her husband said: \u201cYesterday had some good ones and tomorrow has some good ones. Today I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cDave Chappelle is today,\u201d his wife reminded him.\n\u201cBut today is Rollie Fingers and Rob Halford,\u201d Mr. Laakso said, referring to a former Oakland A\u2019s relief pitcher and the singer in the heavy metal band Judas Priest. \u201cI think that\u2019s pretty good company. Rollie Fingers, the best mustache in baseball.\u201d", "date": "Aug. 28, 2015", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/30/nyregion/superiority-burger-a-vegetarian-ode-to-white-castle-in-the-east-village.html", "tags": "cornelius burger superiority good white \u201d ms. laakso cheese vegetarian castle village ode like east"}
