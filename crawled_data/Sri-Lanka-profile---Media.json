{"title": "Sri Lanka profile - Media", "content": "Sri Lanka's media divide along language and ethnic lines.\nPrivately-owned networks have the lion's share of the TV audience. Non-state media often engage in political debate and criticise government policies.\nThe state runs two TV stations, radio networks and newspapers in Sinhala, Tamil and English.\nAt the height of the civil war Sri Lanka was one of the world's most dangerous places for journalists. \nDespite the pledges given by President Sirisena in 2015 to investigate past attacks on journalists, nearly all the crimes of violence against journalists remain unpunished, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said in 2018. \nRSF said political control over media ownership is a major concern and has the potential to undermine pluralism and impartiality. \nThere were some 6.7 million internet users by 2018 (Internetworldstats.com). The web is a popular and growing medium for news.\nThere were major restrictions to online connectivity and social media platforms during communal violence in early 2018, said US-based Freedom House.", "date": "8 January 2019", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-12000330", "tags": "lanka tv media profile rsf political sri networks violence journalists"}
