{"title": "Anthony Weiner\u2019s Latest Sexting Scandal: Here\u2019s What We Know", "content": "Hours after former Representative Anthony D. Weiner of New York apparently deleted his Twitter account in the wake of a New York Post report that he had been involved in another sexting episode with a woman online last year, his wife announced that the couple were separating.\nIt was at least the third public episode involving such behavior by Mr. Weiner, who resigned from Congress in 2011 after it was revealed he had been sending lewd messages and photos to women online. That sexting scandal destroyed his political career, derailed a comeback attempt in 2013 and strained his marriage to Huma Abedin, a top aide to Hillary Clinton.\nOn Monday, Ms. Abedin said in a statement: \u201cAfter long and painful consideration and work on my marriage, I have made the decision to separate from my husband. Anthony and I remain devoted to doing what is best for our son, who is the light of our life. During this difficult time, I ask for respect for our privacy.\u201d\nThe woman told The Post that the online chats started in January 2015 and that they continued through this month.\nScreen shots published by The Post showed that the two exchanged photos \u2014 of the woman in various bikinis and of Mr. Weiner half-dressed, showing off his abs or his crotch \u2014 and that they talked about sex.\nIn one message, Mr. Weiner abruptly changed the discussion from massage parlors and wrote, \u201cSomeone just climbed into my bed.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d the woman said.\nHis response, in a screen shot dated just July 31, 2015, showed a child curled up next to Mr. Weiner, who was wearing white shorts. Mr. Weiner and Ms. Abedin have a son, Jordan, 5.\nThe Post did not identify the woman but described her as a \u201cself-avowed supporter of Donald Trump and the National Rifle Association who\u2019s used Twitter to bash both President Obama and Clinton.\u201d\nMr. Weiner, asked by The Post for comment, \u201cadmitted he and the woman \u2018have been friends for some time,\u2019 \u201d according to the article.\n\u201cShe has asked me not to comment except to say that our conversations were private, often included pictures of her nieces and nephews and my son and were always appropriate,\u201d Mr. Weiner was quoted as saying.\nMr. Weiner could not immediately be reached for comment on Monday.\n\u25a0 When Mr. Weiner resigned from Congress in 2011, he publicly apologized and vowed to change his behavior, but he denied having an addiction. But in 2013, his attempt at a political comeback as a New York mayoral candidate was scuttled when it was revealed he had again been exchanging messages online with at least three more women under the nom de guerre \u201cCarlos Danger.\u201d\nA documentary, \u201cWeiner,\u201d released in May, traced the disastrous campaign and the effects on Ms. Abedin, who is shown near tears after the sexting revelations were made public.\n\u25a0 According to a New York Times report, Ms. Abedin learned only on Sunday while the couple were in the Hamptons with their son that Mr. Weiner had sent a photo of himself and the boy to the unidentified woman.\n\u25a0 Mr. Weiner\u2019s ties to the Clinton campaign make his explicit messages a useful weapon by the Trump camp in the bruising race to the White House.\nIndeed, Mr. Trump released a statement on Monday that said the episode was an issue of national security. \u201cI only worry for the country in that Hillary Clinton was careless and negligent in allowing Weiner to have such close proximity to highly classified information. Who knows what he learned and who he told? It\u2019s just another example of Hillary Clinton\u2019s bad judgment.\u201d\n\u25a0 The Daily News said it would no longer carry Mr. Weiner\u2019s columns, which included his writings on  New York City politics.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve severed ties with him as a columnist,\u201d Joshua Greenman, a Daily News editor, said on Monday in an email. (The Daily Beast initially reported The News\u2019 decision.)\n\u25a0 The television station NY1 also put Mr. Weiner on \u201cindefinite leave\u201d from his position as a contributor. Mr. Weiner had appeared on \u201cInside City Hall.\u201d\n\u25a0 As for the involvement of the child\u2019s image in a post, New York City\u2019s Administration for Children\u2019s Services said in a statement that because of confidentiality, it would not comment on the possibility that it may begin an inquiry.\nIn an interview with The New York Times in July, when asked whether he was still engaging in the activities that got him into trouble, Mr. Weiner said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to go down the path of talking about any of that.\n\u201cBut I will say this: There\u2019s no doubt that the Trump phenomenon has led a lot of people to say to me, \u2018Boy, compared to inviting the Russians to come hack someone\u2019s email, your thing seems almost quaint.\u2019 \u201d", "date": "Aug. 29, 2016", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/30/us/politics/anthony-weiners-latest-sexting-scandal-heres-what-we-know.html", "tags": "\u25a0 know latest \u201c scandal weiner york woman sexting post new anthony"}
