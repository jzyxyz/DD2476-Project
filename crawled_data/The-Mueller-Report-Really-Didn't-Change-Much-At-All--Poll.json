{"title": "The Mueller Report Really Didn't Change Much At All- Poll", "content": "The Mueller report has bolstered President Donald Trump\u2019s critics in their conviction that the president committed wrongdoing, but has otherwise done little to jostle deeply polarized public opinion, a new HuffPost/YouGov poll suggests.\nThe survey was conducted immediately following the release last Thursday of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s redacted report on the Trump campaign\u2019s relationship with Russia. The report did not find coordination between Trump\u2019s campaign and Russian officials to influence the 2016 election, and Mueller declined to determine whether the president had obstructed justice\u00a0because the special counsel apparently didn\u2019t believe it was his job to do so. But the report clearly laid out several instances in which Trump attempted to undermine the Russia investigation \u2015 and didn\u2019t succeed only because his staffers refused to carry out his orders.\nIf the report is something less than the clear-cut condemnation many of Trump\u2019s opponents believe is warranted,\u00a0and falls far short of the complete exoneration that the president\u2019s allies have claimed it to be, that is reflected in the polling. Views of Trump\u2019s behavior are, reliably, more negative than positive, but Americans remain divided over what to make of the report\u2019s findings, with a substantial minority still unclear on what to think.\nBy a 10-point margin, 45% to 35% percent, people who\u2019ve heard at least something about the report\u2019s release say it does not entirely clear Trump. Another 20% aren\u2019t sure.\nThirty-one percent who\u2019ve heard at least something about the report say the information contained shows Trump is unfit to be president, with 18% calling it damaging but not disqualifying, and 31% saying it reveals nothing damaging. \nWhat people make of the report, for the most part, tends to coincide neatly with their pre-existing political views. Only 1% of Trump voters say they think the report shows that Trump is unfit for the presidency, while only 2% of Hillary Clinton voters say they don\u2019t find it at all damaging.\nHere\u2019s a one-sentence summary of the Mueller report\u2019s findings, as offered by a Clinton voter whose news sources included MSNBC: \u201cNot enough evidence to show conspiracy with Russia; plenty of evidence to suggest obstruction of justice, but that is Congress\u2019s call.\u201d\nFrom a Trump voter, whose sources included Fox News: \u201cPresident did not collude and there isn\u2019t enough evidence to prove he obstructed, just was upset by it.\u201d\nAnd from a non-voter, who followed the story mostly online: \u201cAll government sucks no matter who they are or where they are from.\u201d\nAmericans as a whole say, 43% to 34%, that they believe Trump attempted to obstruct Mueller\u2019s investigation, with the rest unsure. By a 5-point margin, 40% to 35%, the public wants Congress to hold further hearings rather than ending the investigation. (Responses to this question, it\u2019s worth noting, appear particularly susceptible to differences in wording \u2015 last month, one poll found Americans broadly in favor of future investigations, another found them broadly in favor of moving on to other issues, and a third showed a roughly even split between those positions.)\nThe results require a few caveats. First, the survey was taken immediately after the Mueller report\u2019s release, when even many politically engaged Americans who planned to dig into the takeaways hadn\u2019t yet had a chance to do so. That leaves some room for change as opinions solidify.\u00a0\nSecond, it\u2019s only one poll. As additional surveys from other outlets are released in the coming days, they\u2019ll help to provide a fuller picture of how Americans view the report and what they want to see happen next.\nWith that said, a few more details from the survey:\nDespite the fanfare surrounding the report\u2019s release, public opinion regarding the investigation has remained, in many respects, unaffected.\nMueller\u2019s approval rating \u2015 44% approve, 28% disapprove \u2015 is virtually unchanged from late March, as are perceptions about the accuracy of his report. Last month, before the redacted report was released, 22% of Americans reported that they understood Mueller\u2019s findings very well. In the latest survey, that number was exactly the same.\nWhat has changed, meanwhile, looks largely like a reversion to form. After Attorney General William Barr first summarized the report, Clinton voters\u2019 convictions that it would prove damning dropped, although it did nothing to improve their overall view of the president. In a February HuffPost/YouGov survey, 73% of Clinton voters believed that, based on Mueller\u2019s findings, the Trump campaign\u2019s relationship with Russia was a very serious problem. In March, that number fell to 44%; in the latest survey, it rose back to 61%. \nOpinions among Trump voters and non-voters barely budged over that time.\nIn March, 62% of Clinton voters said they believed Trump had personally committed crimes; in the latest poll, that number rose to 79%.\nThe other most notable change comes in Clinton voters\u2019 increasing enmity toward Barr. In March, 37% of that group strongly disapproved of his job performance as attorney general. Now, 58% do.\nJust 14% of Americans say they\u2019ve personally read any of Mueller\u2019s report. (Since survey respondents tend to be more civically engaged than the average Americans, and since some people are also likely to overstate their own attention, this figure is, if anything, probably a little high.) Thirty-seven percent planned to read at least part of the report eventually, while the rest were unsure or had no plans to do so.\nThe vast majority, 86%, say they\u2019ve heard at least a little news about the report\u2019s release, with 44% saying they\u2019ve heard a lot about it \u2015 nearly identical to the level of attention paid when Mueller announced the report\u2019s completion in March. A majority of both Clinton and Trump voters have heard a lot about the report, while only about a quarter of nonvoters have paid similarly close attention.\nOf those who\u2019ve heard at least something, 44% got at least some of their news about the report online, 38% from cable TV, 35% from a national broadcast network, and 34% from local TV. Younger Americans following the story were likely to get their news online or from social media, while older adults relied more heavily on televised sources. \nMore than three-quarters of Trump voters who followed the story on cable news said they got at least some of their news from Fox, a number not matched by any single news source across the aisle. (For comparison, a little less than half of Clinton voters who followed the story on cable watched MSNBC, with a similar share choosing CNN.)\nThe HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted April 18-19 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov\u2019s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.\nHuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

More details on the polls\u2019 methodology are available here.\nMost surveys report a margin of error that represents some but not all potential survey errors. YouGov\u2019s reports include a model-based margin of error, which rests on a specific set of statistical assumptions about the selected sample rather than the standard methodology for random probability sampling. If these assumptions are wrong, the model-based margin of error may also be inaccurate.
