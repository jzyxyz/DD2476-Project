{"title": "Activists Score Big Victory For Medicaid Expansion In Utah", "content": "Utah voters are on the verge of getting a chance this November to do what the state\u2019s GOP leaders won\u2019t: expand health coverage to an estimated 150,000 low-income adults.\nUtah Decides Healthcare, a coalition of activist groups, health care organizations and consumer advocates, submitted enough signatures from Utahns to place an initiative on the ballot this November that would expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, the organization announced in a press release Monday. State officials have to review the signatures and are expected to decide next month whether enough are valid to put the initiative on the ballot.\nUtah is one of three states where voters may get an opportunity to go around their governors and legislators to expand Medicaid. \nThere are similar campaigns underway in Idaho and Nebraska. Mainers voted\u00a0for the Medicaid expansion last year, making it the first state to enact the policy through direct voter action. Maine Gov. Paul LePage (R), however, has thus far refused to implement the Medicaid expansion.\nThe Affordable Care Act\u2019s authors intended a nationwide expansion of Medicaid eligibility to anyone earning up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, which is about $16,000 a year for a single person and $33,000 for a family of four. In 2012, however, the Supreme Court ruled that states could opt out of the expansion.\nUtah, Idaho and Nebraska are among the 18 states that have refused to participate. The federal government covers at least 90 percent of the cost of the expansion, with states responsible for the remainder.\nMedicaid expansion has been a subject of debate in Utah since the Supreme Court ruling. At times, Gov. Gary Herbert (R) has expressed support for some form of expansion, but it hasn\u2019t gained enough support in the majority-Republican legislature to move forward. \nThe Utah Senate approved a privatized version of the expansion two years ago, but the state House didn\u2019t act on it. Last year, the state implemented a small Medicaid expansion targeting about 6,000 homeless people and low-income people with substance-use and mental health problems.\nIn March, Herbert signed a bill that would expand Medicaid eligibility to up to 100 percent of the poverty level, which is about $12,000 for a single person and $25,000 for a family of four. The move would extend coverage to an estimated 72,000 people.\nThat partial expansion, however, depends on federal approval, which isn\u2019t assured. \nThe Affordable Care Act is explicit that the extra federal money available to states for broadening Medicaid eligibility only applies to expansions to 133 percent of poverty. President Barack Obama\u2019s administration wouldn\u2019t permit these partial expansions, and President Donald Trump\u2019s administration would be on shaky legal ground if they approved Utah\u2019s request. The Trump administration last month declined to approve Arkansas\u2019 request to scale back its Medicaid expansion to 100 percent of poverty.\nMedicaid expansion enjoys the support of a majority of Utahns, according to a poll conducted in January by The Salt Lake Tribune and the University of Utah\u2019s Hinckley Institute of Politics. \nThe survey found that 62 percent of the state\u2019s residents want to see Medicaid expanded. That includes 51 percent of Republicans who were polled, along with 93 percent of Democrats, the Tribune reported in February.\nUtah Decides Healthcare had to collect 113,143 signatures by Sunday to put expansion on the ballot, a figure that represents 10 percent of the number of Utahns who voted in the 2016 presidential election. In addition, the signatures had to come from across the state, with at least 10 percent of 2016 presidential voters in 26 of 29 state Senate districts. \nIn the end, the coalition met the geographic requirements and exceeded the overall threshold by gathering signatures from more than 165,000 people, Utah Decides Healthcare announced.\nActivists in Idaho and Nebraska are hoping to duplicate these results. \nReclaim Idaho, a grassroots outfit founded last year, has until May 1 to collect 56,000 signatures. As in Utah, they must come from all over the state. The total must be at least equal to 6 percent of the state\u2019s registered voters, and they must meet the same threshold in 18 of Idaho\u2019s 35 state legislative districts.\nIn Nebraska, a coalition called Insure the Good Life \u2015 made up of progressive groups and health care advocates, including the Nebraska Hospital Association \u2015 is leading the campaign. \nTo put Medicaid expansion on the ballot, activists in Nebraska must gather 85,000 signatures,\u00a0representing 7 percent of the state\u2019s registered voters, by July 5. Nebraska also requires that the signatures be from around the whole state, so the activists must get signatures from 5 percent of registered voters in 38 of the state\u2019s 93 counties.\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this article misstated the number of counties in Nebraska. It is 93, not 92.", "date": "\n04/16/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/utah-medicaid-expansion_n_5ad4eca6e4b016a07e9f6138", "tags": "nebraska score percent victory voters medicaid states signatures activists state expansion utah care big"}
