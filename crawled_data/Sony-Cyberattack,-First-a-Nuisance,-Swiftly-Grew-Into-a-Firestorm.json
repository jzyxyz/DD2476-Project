But Michael Lynton, the studio\u2019s chief executive, was nonetheless driving his Volkswagen GTI toward Sony\u2019s lot at 6 a.m. Final planning for corporate meetings in Tokyo was on his agenda \u2014 at least until his cellphone rang.\nThe studio\u2019s chief financial officer, David C. Hendler, was calling to tell his boss that Sony\u2019s computer system had been compromised in a hacking of unknown proportions. To prevent further damage, technicians were debating whether to take Sony Pictures entirely offline.\nShortly after Mr. Lynton reached his office in the stately Thalberg building at Sony headquarters in Culver City, Calif., it became clear that the situation was much more dire. Some of the studio\u2019s 7,000 employees, arriving at work, turned on their computers to find macabre images of Mr. Lynton\u2019s severed head. Sony shut down all computer systems shortly thereafter, including those in overseas offices, leaving the company in the digital dark ages: no voice mail, no corporate email, no production systems.\nA handful of old BlackBerrys, located in a storage room in the Thalberg basement, were given to executives. Staff members began to trade text messages using hastily arranged phone trees. Sony\u2019s already lean technical staff began working around the clock, with some people sleeping in company offices that became littered with stale pizza. Administrators hauled out old machines that allowed them to cut physical payroll checks in lieu of electronic direct deposit.\nStill, for days the episode was viewed inside Sony as little more than a colossal annoyance. Though Sony executives were quickly in touch with federal law enforcement officials, the company\u2019s initial focus was on setting up jury-rigged systems to let it limp through what was expected to be a few days or weeks of inconvenience. The company\u2019s first statement on the breach, made on Nov. 24, seems almost absurdly bland in retrospect: \u201cWe are investigating an I.T. matter.\u201d\nIn fact, less than three weeks later Sony would be the focal point of a global firestorm over a growing digital attack on its corporate identity and data; its movie \u201cThe Interview,\u201d about the fictional assassination of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un; and its own handling of the ensuing crisis.\nInterviews with over two dozen people involved in the episode suggest that Sony \u2014 slow to realize the depths of its peril \u2014 let its troubles deepen by mounting a public defense only after enormous damage had been done. The initial decision to treat the attack as largely an internal matter reflected Hollywood habit and the executive sang-froid of Mr. Lynton, who can be cool almost to a fault. As Mr. Lynton discovered, however, at a midpoint in the episode, this predicament required a wholly different approach.\nIn truth, \u201cThere is no playbook for us to turn to,\u201d Mr. Lynton told his staff at one point. Mr. Lynton and his colleagues underestimated the ferocity of the interaction between the news media and the hackers as the drama unfolded in December. Hackers released the information to traffic-hungry websites, which published the most embarrassing details, while Sony mostly stayed publicly silent.\nHurt by a misstep when it announced the cancellation of a Christmas Day release for \u201cThe Interview,\u201d Sony was knocked about by criticism by the White House, Hollywood stars and others who accused it of capitulating to extortionist threats. The studio\u2019s ultimate success in showing its film in face of a terror threat came after Mr. Lynton\u2019s natural reserve fell more in line with the passion and grit of the studio\u2019s co-chairwoman, Amy Pascal, who was undermined early in the attack by the disclosure of embarrassing personal emails.\nThe son of a German Jew who served in British intelligence during World War II, Mr. Lynton, 54, had weathered past corporate crises, including an inherited accounting scandal when he ran the Penguin publishing house and a recent attempt by the activist investor Daniel S. Loeb to force change at Sony. But neither of those episodes matched the complexity and surreal twists of the hacking, which ultimately became a test of national will, a referendum on media behavior and a defense of free expression, even of the crudest sort.\n\u201cWhat it amounted to was criminal extortion,\u201d Mr. Lynton said in an interview.\nBy Dec. 1, a week after Sony discovered the breach, a sense of urgency and horror had penetrated the studio. More than a dozen F.B.I. investigators were setting up shop on the Culver City lot and in a separate Sony facility near the Los Angeles airport called Corporate Pointe, helping Sony deal with one of the worst cyberattacks ever on an American company.\nMountains of documents had been stolen, internal data centers had been wiped clean, and 75 percent of the servers had been destroyed.\nEverything and anything had been taken. Contracts. Salary lists. Film budgets. Medical records. Social Security numbers. Personal emails. Five entire movies, including the yet-to-be-released \u201cAnnie.\u201d\nLater, it would become apparent through files stolen by the hackers and published online that Mr. Lynton and Ms. Pascal had been given an oblique warning. On Nov. 21, in an email signed by \u201cGod\u2019s Apstls,\u201d the studio was told to pay money for an unspecified reason by Nov. 24. If the studio did not comply, the bizarre missive said, \u201cSony Pictures will be bombarded as a whole.\u201d\nBut the warning either did not find its way to Mr. Lynton or he missed its importance in the daily flood of messages to his inbox. In the first days of the attack, responsibility for which was claimed by a group calling itself \u201cGuardians of Peace,\u201d the notion of North Korean involvement was little more than a paranoid whisper.\nIn June, a spokesman for North Korea\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement said the country would take \u201ca decisive and merciless countermeasure\u201d if the United States government permitted Sony to make its planned Christmas release of the comedy \u201cThe Interview.\u201d\nAt the time, the threat seemed to many almost as absurd as the film, which was not mentioned in early communications from the hackers.\nIn the gossipy nexus that quickly connected Hollywood\u2019s trade news media with studio insiders and a growing circuit of information technology experts, talk circulated of a \u201cmole\u201d \u2014 a Sony employee who was presumed by many to have been instrumental in penetrating the computer systems and spotting the most sensitive data.\nThe theory of violation by an ex-employee or disgruntled insider persists among computer security experts who remain unpersuaded by the F.B.I.'s focus on evidence pointing toward North Korea, which the agency made public in a news release on Dec. 19.\nBut senior Sony executives, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is incomplete, now say the talk of a rogue insider reflects a misunderstanding of the F.B.I.'s initial conclusions about the hacking. Federal investigators, they said, did not strongly suspect an inside job.\nRather, these executives said, the F.B.I. found that the hackers had used digital techniques to steal the credentials and passwords from a systems administrator who had maximum access to Sony\u2019s computer systems. Once in control of the gateways those items opened, theft of information was relatively easy.\nGovernment investigators and Sony\u2019s private security experts traced the hacking through a network of foreign servers and identified malicious software bearing the familiar hallmarks of a hacking gang known as Dark Seoul. Prodded for inside information at a social gathering \u2014 long before the F.B.I. announced any conclusions \u2014 Doug Belgrad, president of Sony\u2019s motion picture group, responded, \u201cIt\u2019s the Koreans.\u201d\nAs the F.B.I. stepped up its inquiry, the hackers \u2014 who still had made no explicit mention of \u201cThe Interview\u201d \u2014 dropped the first in a series of data bundles that were to prove a feast for websites like Gawker and mainstream services like Bloomberg News for weeks.\nAnd so was set a pattern. Every few days, hackers would dump a vast new group of documents onto anonymous posting sites. Reporters and other parties who had shown an interest in searching the Sony files were then sent email alerts \u2014 essentially digital treasure maps from the hackers.\nThe files seemed to fulfill every Hollywood gossip\u2019s fantasy of what is said behind studio walls. Ms. Pascal was caught swapping racially insensitive jokes about President Obama\u2019s presumed taste in African-American films. A top Sony producer, Scott Rudin, was discovered harshly criticizing Angelina Jolie. Mr. Lynton was revealed to be angling for a job at New York University.\nSony technicians privately started fighting back by moving to disrupt access to the data dumps. But the studio \u2014 apart from public apologies by Ms. Pascal \u2014 was largely silent on the disclosures.\nIn this, Mr. Lynton was perhaps betrayed by his own cool. While Ms. Pascal alternately wept and raged about the violation, Mr. Lynton assumed the more detached manner that had served him well in the publishing world. Mr. Lynton engaged in debates with lawyers who rendered conflicting opinions as to whether media outlets could in fact be stopped from trading in goods that were, after all, stolen.\nAs a tough and seasoned executive in her own right, Ms. Pascal brought badly needed expression to emotions that many, perhaps most, Sony employees were feeling. Hoarse and humbled, she would eventually bring colleagues to her side with an address at an all-hands gathering on the Sony lot in which she said: \u201cI\u2019m so terribly sorry. All I can really do now is apologize and ask for your forgiveness.\u201d\nUntil shortly before that, Mr. Lynton was hesitant about confronting media outlets with legal action. But the lawyer David Boies persuaded him there was a case to be made against free trade in information that was essentially stolen property. Mr. Boies on Dec. 14 began sending legal warnings to about 40 media outlets using the stolen data.\nOn Dec. 15, while rallying the troops at that gathering on the Sony lot, Mr. Lynton displayed flashes of anger and words of resolve \u2014 fighting spirit he had not shown publicly. \u201cSome of the reporting on this situation has been truly outrageous, and is, quite frankly, disgusting,\u201d he said. He urged employees not to read the anticipated next waves of emails, lest they turn on one another.\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned, very concerned, that if people continue to read these emails, relationships will be damaged and hurt here at the studio,\u201d he said.\nShortly before 10 a.m. the next day, Dec. 16, the hackers made good on their promise of a \u201cChristmas gift,\u201d delivering thousands of Mr. Lynton\u2019s emails to the posting sites. With the emails came a message that within minutes converted the hacking from corporate annoyance to national threat and fully jolted Sony from defense to offense.\n\u201cSoon all the world will see what an awful movie Sony Pictures Entertainment has made,\u201d it said. \u201cThe world will be full of fear. Remember the 11th of September 2001.\u201d The message specifically cited \u201cThe Interview\u201d and its planned opening.\nUnfazed until then by Sony\u2019s problems, exhibitors were instantly galvanized. \u201cWhen you invoke 9/11, it\u2019s a game changer,\u201d said one theater executive.\nWithin hours, the National Association of Theater Owners convened a board meeting. Through the day, the exhibitors were briefed by Sony executives (though not by Mr. Lynton), who took a position that infuriated some owners: The studio would not cancel the film, but it would not quarrel with any theater that withdrew it because of security concerns.\n\u201cSony basically punted,\u201d said one theater executive, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality strictures. \u201cFrankly,\u201d the executive added, \u201cit\u2019s their movie, and their mess.\u201d\nCarmike Cinemas, one of the country\u2019s four largest chains, was the first to withdraw. By the morning of Dec. 17, owners of about 80 percent of the country\u2019s movie theaters \u2014 including Regal Entertainment, AMC Entertainment, and Cinemark, already mired in legal fights over a 2012 theater shooting in Colorado \u2014 had pulled out.\nAt the same time, Mr. Lynton was advised by George Rose, who is in charge of human resources, that employees, for the first time since the initial attack, were showing signs of being deeply shaken by the possibility of violence to themselves and to the audience.\nThat afternoon, Sony dropped \u201cThe Interview\u201d from its schedule. In theory, the studio had gotten its way by putting the onus for cancellation on apprehensive theater owners.\nBut Sony at that moment made a critical error. In a hasty statement, in some cases delivered orally to reporters, the studio said it had \u201cno further release plan\u201d for \u201cThe Interview.\u201d In fact, Mr. Lynton had been talking with Google\u2019s chairman, Eric E. Schmidt, and others about an alternative online release \u2014 discussions that Google would later confirm publicly. But Sony\u2019s statement was widely interpreted to mean Sony would shelve the movie for good, leaving an impression that it had caved to the hackers and a terrorist threat.\nThe reaction was swift and furious. Hollywood stars and free speech advocates sharply criticized the decision. On Friday, Dec. 19, President Obama used his final news briefing of the year to rebuke Sony for its handling of the North Korean threat: \u201cWe cannot have a dictator imposing censorship in the U.S.\u201d For Mr. Lynton, the president\u2019s remarks became a personal low point in the entire affair. He had expected support from Mr. Obama \u2014 of whom Mr. Lynton and his wife, Jamie, were early and ardent backers in 2007. \u201cI would be fibbing to say I wasn\u2019t disappointed,\u201d Mr. Lynton told a CNN interviewer shortly afterward, understating his reaction. (Mr. Lynton had already agreed to the CNN interview and, in fact, watched the president\u2019s news conference from a TV in a CNN lounge.)\n\u201cYou know, the president and I haven\u2019t spoken,\u201d Mr. Lynton added. \u201cI don\u2019t know exactly whether he understands the sequence of events that led up to the movies\u2019 not being shown in the movie theaters.\u201d\nThe president\u2019s decision to specifically \u2014 and harshly \u2014 criticize Sony was not mapped before the news conference, according to two senior American officials. But it was clear to Mr. Obama\u2019s aides and national security staff that the president felt passionately about the issue and was eager to push for the film\u2019s release, the officials said.\nShortly after the president spoke, shocked Sony executives spoke with senior members of the White House staff, asking whether they had known that the president was going to criticize them. The staff members told the executives that nothing had been planned.\nIn the end, the exchanges were constructive, as administration officials persuaded Sony that an expanded electronic attack was unlikely; that gave the studio cover to tell the distributors and theaters they were very likely safe to show the film. But Mr. Obama played no direct role in pushing deals that, in less than a week, would put \u201cThe Interview\u201d online and in 331 smaller theaters.\nSony\u2019s Christmas Eve triumph in announcing an immediate online release of \u201cThe Interview\u201d was more fragile than it looked. While Google had been committed for a week, Microsoft and its Xbox service came aboard only late the night before.\nIn the end, the film may be seen by more viewers than if it had experienced an unimpeded, conventional release, particularly if, as studio executives suspect, those who paid for the film online were joined by friends and family. Sony said \u201cThe Interview\u201d generated roughly $15 million in online sales and rentals during its first four days of availability.\nNow, five weeks into the episode, Sony\u2019s internal technology is still impaired. Executives estimate that a return to normal is at least five to seven weeks away.\nBut the studio\u2019s spirit apparently remains intact. Showing up in the Sony cafeteria for lunch last week, as a theatrical release and the Google and Microsoft deals were announced, Mr. Lynton was surrounded by 30 to 40 employees who told him they were proud to be at Sony and to get the movie out.\n\u201cIf we put our heads down and focus on our work, I honestly think we can recover from this in short order,\u201d Mr. Lynton said on Sunday.", "date": "Dec. 30, 2014", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/31/business/media/sony-attack-first-a-nuisance-swiftly-grew-into-a-firestorm-.html", "tags": "sony studio first nuisance would \u201d interview lynton swiftly grew \u2014 firestorm cyberattack"}
