{"title": "Military Competition in Pacific Endures as Biggest Flash Point Between U.S. and China", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Trade disputes have for months been the focus of souring relations between the United States and China. But intractable problems in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait underscore that competition for dominance of the Pacific Ocean remains the most volatile source of conflict between the two nations \u2014 and the tensions are rising.\nThat became clear in barbed comments during a meeting in Washington last week in which Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, and Jim Mattis, the defense secretary, negotiated with their Chinese counterparts. And it is evident as Vice President Mike Pence is in Asia this week to talk to East Asian and Southeast Asian leaders to shore up support for American efforts to counterbalance China.\nMr. Pence\u2019s trip includes stops at two Asia-Pacific summit meetings, where he plans to speak about checking China\u2019s influence and power projection. Since his broad speech last month on American competition with China, Mr. Pence has become the face of the administration\u2019s aggressive approach to Beijing.\nSome Asia analysts say, though, that President Trump\u2019s absence sends a signal that the United States is not committed to the region: President Xi Jinping of China and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia are each attending at least one of the gatherings.\nStrategy for the region, in Washington and Beijing, revolves around how each country can assert military dominance in the Pacific. For now, the most powerful military in the region is still that of the United States, which relies on the ability to have unfettered naval access to the South China Sea and the support of the self-governing island of Taiwan to bolster its standing.\nBut China has become more aggressive in trying to assert dominance over both. And its state-owned companies are making inroads in the islands of Oceania \u2014 from Saipan to Vanuatu \u2014 with infrastructure projects. American officials say those could eventually become beachheads for the People\u2019s Liberation Army, which would pose a challenge to the United States Navy\u2019s operational command in the far island chains. Australia is also watching closely because the South Pacific has traditionally been its sphere of influence.\nCloser to home, China has continued to place military equipment and installations on rocks and reefs in the South China Sea, over which it claims sovereignty. And it is persuading some nations to sever diplomatic ties with Taiwan while forcing foreign companies, including hotels and airlines, to drop any mention of Taiwan.\nThere is a consensus in Washington that American officials need to find ways of pushing back.\nIn the South China Sea, that has mainly taken the form of what are called freedom-of-navigation operations by the Navy, in which ships sail near the islands or features claimed by Beijing to establish that the waters are international \u2014 and not Chinese territory. On Sept. 30, American and Chinese warships nearly collided, coming within 45 yards of each other.\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Pence\u2019s plane flew over the South China Sea to Singapore, where he attended the annual summit meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Mr. Pence told a Washington Post columnist on the plane that the flight, which passed within 50 miles of the contested Spratly Islands, was a type of freedom-of-navigation operation.\n\u201cWe will not be intimidated,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will not stand down. We will continue to exercise freedom of navigation.\u201d\nGraham Allison, a Harvard Kennedy School professor who wrote a book on the potential for war between the United States and China, said most people in the region had thought it was \u201cgame over\u201d on the South China Sea \u2014 too late to roll back China\u2019s presence from rocks and reefs, as well as islands it created by dredging sand.\nBut \u201cthe Trump administration now means to fight back vigorously on all fronts, including on the South China Sea \u2014 and perhaps even on Taiwan,\u201d Mr. Allison said.\nLast Friday, at the close of the Washington meeting with their Chinese counterparts, Mr. Pompeo and Mr. Mattis made sharp comments on Pacific issues.\n\u201cRegarding our strong ties with a democratic Taiwan, I reiterated the U.S. policy has not changed and that we are concerned about China\u2019s increasing efforts to coerce others, constraining Taiwan\u2019s international space,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said, notably, in opening remarks to journalists.\nLater, Gen. Wei Fenghe, the Chinese defense minister, made his own assertive comments on Taiwan, referencing the American Civil War and the United States Pledge of Allegiance.\n\u201cTo achieve reunification is a mission for our party and our country,\u201d General Wei said. \u201cIn the Pledge of Allegiance to the U.S., there is this sentence saying this is a nation under God, indivisible. So it is the same with Taiwan. It is an inalienable part of China.\u201d\nIf \u201cthis territorial integrity is under threat,\u201d he said, China would move to maintain it \u201cat any cost,\u201d just as the United States had to do \u201cin the Civil War.\u201d\nAnalysts in Washington took note of the remarks.\n\u201cI believe it\u2019s rare that the U.S. side raises Taiwan in a news conference with the Chinese in an opening statement,\u201d said Bonnie S. Glaser, a senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cPompeo referred to \u2018democratic Taiwan.\u2019 That will surely rankle the Chinese. I expect China\u2019s remarks in private regarding Taiwan were even sharper.\u201d\nThe United States has been more aggressive in defending Taiwanese interests since John R. Bolton became national security adviser in April.\nLast month, the Pentagon sailed two warships through the Taiwan Strait, which underscored the potential for conflict.\nThe White House had initially considered sending an aircraft carrier through the strait \u2014 something the United States has not done since 2007. That most likely would have ignited a furious response from China. Instead, the Pentagon sent a cruiser and a destroyer.\nDefense Department officials had argued that the carrier would be too provocative at a time when Washington and Beijing are already at loggerheads over trade and other issues. That includes Communist Party repression of ethnic Uighur Muslims, which Mr. Pompeo regularly denounces. On Wednesday, American legislators introduced bills calling on the Trump administration to take action to defend the Uighurs.\nMr. Mattis and Mr. Wei have tried to lower the temperature on tensions in the Pacific. Before the Washington talks, the two met in Singapore last month on the sidelines of a conclave of Southeast Asian defense ministers.\nBut one Defense Department official said that cordial talks were the limits of what the two nations could achieve for now. Both countries have dug into seemingly nonnegotiable positions on China\u2019s militarization of disputed land features in the South China Sea \u2014 the issue that most bedevils the military relationship.\nThe Chinese do not describe their actions as militarization; they accuse the United States of militarizing the sea with its freedom-of-navigation ship operations and overflights. Now, officials from Britain and France say their navies are also taking part in the operations, even though Southeast Asian nations contesting China\u2019s claims have not publicly committed to participating.\nYang Jiechi, the senior Chinese foreign policy official who attended the Washington meeting, said China was building what he described as civilian facilities and necessary defense facilities \u201con its own territory.\u201d\n\u201cThe Chinese side made it clear to the United States that it should stop sending its vessels and military aircraft close to Chinese islands and reefs, and stop actions that undermine China\u2019s sovereignty and security interest,\u201d Mr. Yang said.\nMichael Pillsbury, an author on the Chinese military cited by Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence, said the Chinese would no doubt continue to see the actions in a hostile light. They are, he said, \u201cinterpreting these freedom-of-navigation exercises, even when they\u2019re innocent passage, as something more \u2014 provocations, or a declining hegemon trying to maintain its power.\u201d", "date": "Nov. 14, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/world/asia/usa-china-trade-pacific.html", "tags": "competition military washington china taiwan u.s. united states \u201d endures point chinese biggest pacific flash"}
