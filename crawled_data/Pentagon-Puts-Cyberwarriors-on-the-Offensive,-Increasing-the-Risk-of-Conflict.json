{"title": "Pentagon Puts Cyberwarriors on the Offensive, Increasing the Risk of Conflict", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Pentagon has quietly empowered the United States Cyber Command to take a far more aggressive approach to defending the nation against cyberattacks, a shift in strategy that could increase the risk of conflict with the foreign states that sponsor malicious hacking groups.\nUntil now, the Cyber Command has assumed a largely defensive posture, trying to counter attackers as they enter American networks. In the relatively few instances when it has gone on the offensive, particularly in trying to disrupt the online activities of the Islamic State and its recruiters in the past several years, the results have been mixed at best.\nBut in the spring, as the Pentagon elevated the command\u2019s status, it opened the door to nearly daily raids on foreign networks, seeking to disable cyberweapons before they can be unleashed, according to strategy documents and military and intelligence officials.\nThe change in approach was not formally debated inside the White House before it was issued, according to current and former administration officials. But it reflects the greater authority given to military commanders by President Trump, as well as a widespread view that the United States has mounted an inadequate defense against the rising number of attacks aimed at America.\nIt is unclear how carefully the administration has weighed the various risks involved if the plan is acted on in classified operations. Adversaries like Russia, China and North Korea, all nuclear-armed states, have been behind major cyberattacks, and the United States has struggled with the question of how to avoid an unforeseen escalation as it wields its growing cyberarsenal.\nAnother complicating factor is that taking action against an adversary often requires surreptitiously operating in the networks of an ally, like Germany \u2014 a problem that often gave the Obama administration pause.\nThe new strategy envisions constant, disruptive \u201cshort of war\u201d activities in foreign computer networks. It is born, officials said, of more than a decade of counterterrorism operations, where the United States learned that the best way to take on Al Qaeda or the Islamic State was by destroying the militants inside their bases or their living rooms.\nThe objective, according to the new \u201cvision statement\u201d quietly issued by the command, is to \u201ccontest dangerous adversary activity before it impairs our national power.\u201d\nPushing American defenses \u201cas close as possible to the origin of adversary activity extends our reach to expose adversaries\u2019 weaknesses, learn their intentions and capabilities, and counter attacks close to their origins,\u201d the document says. \u201cContinuous engagement imposes tactical friction and strategic costs on our adversaries, compelling them to shift resources to defense and reduce attacks.\u201d\nAnother Pentagon document, dated May 2017, provides a legal basis for attacking nuclear missiles on the launchpad using \u201cnonkinetic options\u201d \u2014 meaning a cyberattack or some other means that does not involve bombing a missile on the pad or otherwise blowing it up.\nThe policy was issued two months after The New York Times revealed that the Obama administration had developed an extensive \u201cleft of launch\u201d capability to attack North Korea\u2019s missiles using cyber and electronic warfare, though it was unclear how well the strategy was working. The new Pentagon legal strategy was first reported by The Daily Beast.\nAs the Defense Department elevated the Cyber Command to a status equal to the Indo-Pacific Command, the European Command, the Space Command and the Joint Special Operations Command, among others, it declared that most of its 133 \u201ccyber mission teams\u201d were combat-ready after years of development.\nBut most of those teams protect Defense Department networks. Offensive cyberaction by the United States has been relatively rare, a reflection of the time it takes to mount operations and the fact that only the president can approve any use of a cyberweapon that is likely to have significant effects. Those operations have included disabling another nation\u2019s nuclear facilities or its missiles, as the United States has attempted in Iran and North Korea, or disrupting the communications of groups like the Islamic State.\nThe president\u2019s sole authority to authorize the use of those weapons is similar to his authority to launch nuclear weapons, a recognition that cyberweapons, even if less powerful than nuclear arms, can have broad, unintended effects.\nUnder the Trump administration, the traditional structure of White House oversight of American offensive and defensive cyberactivities is being dismantled. Days after taking office in April, the new national security adviser, John R. Bolton, forced out the homeland security adviser, Thomas P. Bossert, in part because of his discomfort that Mr. Bossert had direct access to the president.\nMr. Bolton then eliminated the position of White House cybercoordinator, who had overseen the complex mix of cyberactivities run by the American government.\nThe last person who held the job, Rob Joyce, had previously run the Tailored Access Operations unit of the National Security Agency \u2014 the covert \u201cspecial forces\u201d of America\u2019s cyberoperations, which has mounted attacks on critical foreign targets, from Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities to North Korean missile testing sites. Mr. Joyce returned to the N.S.A.\nAmerican intelligence agencies have identified cyberthreats as the No. 1 risk facing the United States \u2014 it has ranked ahead of terrorism for years now in the annual assessment provided to Congress, even before the Russian intrusion into the election. But the White House declared that it did not need a separate cybercoordinator because the issues are included in many other programs. A young National Security Council staff member, with scant experience in the topic, now oversees offensive cyberissues.\nThe United States Cyber Command was created partly in response to a Russian hacking attack that long predated the 2016 election. In the fall of 2008, Russian intelligence agencies penetrated SIPRNet, the Pentagon\u2019s secret internal network; that led to a rush to consolidate several cyberprograms into a command. The Chinese, meanwhile, were stealing weapons designs, including blueprints for the F-35, America\u2019s most expensive fighter jet.\nCyber Command was placed at Fort Meade, Md., home of the National Security Agency, but it has been criticized for being far too dependent on the N.S.A.\u2019s hacking skills.\nA decade later, it is under new command, led by Gen. Paul Nakasone. He was a junior officer in the command\u2019s early days and was deeply involved in one of its first big classified projects, \u201cNitro Zeus\u201d: the plan to use cybertools, among other things, to take down Iran\u2019s air defenses, its communications systems and its power grid if a conflict broke out.\nTo prepare for that day, if it ever happened, the United States tunneled deep inside Iran\u2019s grids, and even Revolutionary Guards Corps command-and-control systems. It was a huge mission, involving hundreds of troops and civilians.\nThe program was never activated; the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement avoided conflict. But now that Mr. Trump has announced that he is abandoning the accord, many of those plans are being dusted off, according to several officials.\nGeneral Nakasone, in his confirmation hearings in March, made clear that a more aggressive approach to opponents in cyberspace would be needed, though he gave few details. \u201cBy conducting operations to frustrate and counter adversary cyberactivities to decrease will, increase cost and deny benefits,\u201d he said, the United States could begin to deliver more decisive blows with its attacks.\nThe same month, Gen. John E. Hyten, the head of Strategic Command, said in testimony that if the United States was going to defend itself in cyberspace, it needed clear rules of day-to-day engagement.\n\u201cCyberspace needs to be looked at as a warfighting domain,\u201d he said, \u201cand if somebody threatens us in cyberspace, we need to have the authorities to respond.\u201d His statement seemed to reflect a view that the current legal authority is too slow.\nThere is little debate inside the government\u2019s sprawling community of cyberwarriors and defenders that the United States needs to step up its game: It did not see the Russian hack of the 2016 election coming, or North Korea\u2019s \u201cWannaCry\u201d attack last year, which crippled the National Health Service in Britain and rippled around the world, partly driven by stolen American cyberweapons.\nBut the risks of escalation \u2014 of United States action in foreign networks leading to retaliatory strikes against American banks, dams, financial markets or communications networks \u2014 are considerable, according to current and former officials. Mr. Trump has shown only a cursory interest in the subject, former aides say, not surprising for a man who does not use a computer and came of age as a business executive in a predigital era.\nEfforts to rewrite the main document governing the presidential authorities in the cyberarena \u2014 Presidential Policy Directive 20, signed by Barack Obama \u2014 have faltered in the chaos of Mr. Bolton\u2019s decision to oust the key players.\n\u201cIt is essentially a \u2018forward defense\u2019 approach,\u201d Jason Healey, who runs the cyber initiative at Columbia University, said recently. \u201cClearly, what we have been doing so far isn\u2019t working. But you want to think through the consequences carefully.\u201d\nThe chief risk is that the internet becomes a battleground of all-against-all, as nations not only place \u201cimplants\u201d in the networks of their adversaries \u2014 something the United States, China, Russia, Iran and North Korea have done with varying levels of sophistication \u2014 but also begin to engage in daily attack and counterattack.", "date": "June 17, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/17/us/politics/cyber-command-trump.html", "tags": "american pentagon offensive cyberwarriors cyber united puts increasing states conflict \u201d command networks operations risk \u2014"}
