{"title": "As China Trade Talks Stall, Xi Faces a Dilemma: Fold? Or Double Down?", "content": "BEIJING \u2014 As Chinese and American officials try to reach a trade deal, President Xi Jinping faces a painful, possibly damaging, choice: to try to protect his aura of indomitability or retreat after President Trump accused China of reneging on the terms of a draft agreement and threatened to raise tariffs.\nThe stakes rose sharply for the Chinese leader this week after Mr. Trump and his chief trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, publicly accused China of backing down on commitments. The sticking point appeared to be a late decision by Mr. Xi to reject American demands that China change laws constraining American businesses.\nWhen Mr. Trump leapt onto Twitter to complain, it was a public rebuke that put Mr. Xi in a tight spot.\nMr. Xi is China\u2019s most powerful leader in decades, and he guards his image as a visionary statesman guiding his country to greatness. But China\u2019s relationship with the United States is its most important, and if ties between the countries are mismanaged, that could damage China\u2019s economy and tarnish Mr. Xi\u2019s authority.\nTrade talks that just last week seemed close to fruition have abruptly become a flash point in the rocky relationship. Mr. Xi now faces questions at home over whether he miscalculated Mr. Trump\u2019s resolve, and domestic rumblings could grow if the United States forces Mr. Xi to make concessions or if the talks break down.\n[Update: President Trump escalated his trade war with China on Friday morning, raising tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.]\n\u201cXi is walking a tightrope,\u201d said Paul Haenle, a former China director on the National Security Council who now runs the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center For Global Policy in Beijing. \u201cHe is going to be the one that has to make the most concessions, and that makes all this more difficult for him.\u201d\nBut geopolitics could help China point to the many ways the sides need each other.\nOn Thursday, shortly before the trade talks were set to resume, North Korea shot off short-range missiles. The United States has long pressed China, the North\u2019s main political and economic supporter, to help rein in the country\u2019s provocations.\nEven if the timing of the launches is a coincidence, they could serve to remind the United States that it needs China\u2019s help to maintain pressure on the North and keep its nuclear program in check.\n\u201cI come bearing sincerity, and hope in the current special circumstances to hold a reasoned, frank exchange of views with the U.S. side,\u201d Liu He, China\u2019s chief negotiator in the trade talks said after arriving in Washington, according to Xinhua, China\u2019s official news agency. \u201cChina believes that increasing tariffs won\u2019t solve problems, won\u2019t benefit China or the United States, and nor will it benefit the global economy.\u201d\nStill, a resolution of the trade war during this week\u2019s talks seems challenging.\nChina had been willing to protect intellectual property and open its markets to American business, but the Trump administration wanted the agreement to specify that some of those changes be made in Chinese law. For China, any legislative change or policy reversal could be a very public \u2014 and potentially humbling \u2014 reminder that it gave ground under pressure.\n\u201cThat would bring back painful memories of the days of national humiliation in our history,\u201d said Wang Yong, the director of the Center for International Political Economy at Peking University. \u201cChina has made too many concessions.\u201d\nThe blaring nature of the Trump administration\u2019s broadsides has sharpened the dilemma that Mr. Xi faces in the negotiations.\n\u201cTo have Trump doing it so publicly is obviously very, very difficult for Xi Jinping,\u201d said Susan L. Shirk, a professor at the University of California, San Diego, who worked as a deputy assistant secretary of state responsible for China under President Bill Clinton. \u201cIt makes it much more difficult for him to make the compromises needed.\u201d\nOn Friday, Mr. Trump raised tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods. The Chinese government said in a statement it would \u201chave to take necessary countermeasures\u201d but didn\u2019t say what those would be. The higher tariffs could shake confidence vital to keeping aloft economic growth in China and around the world, Tu Xinquan, a professor at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing, said in an interview.\nFor the party, stable economic growth is fundamental to political legitimacy.\n\u201cEveryone may have greater doubts and uncertainty about the future of the Chinese economy, Chinese-U.S. relations or the global economy,\u201d Professor Tu said. \u201cThis uncertainty will certainly affect production, investment, and consumption.\u201d\nAt their first summit meeting just two years ago, Mr. Xi told Mr. Trump that China and the United States had \u201ca thousand reasons\u201d to work well together. But the slow pace of negotiations could tarnish in Mr. Xi\u2019s carefully drawn image at home as a master strategist.\nMore than two years into the Trump presidency, Chinese officials still appear to struggle to understand the president, his temperament and his negotiating style. American politicians and experts say that Chinese counterparts often fail to grasp how far and fast wariness of China has hardened into hostility.\n\u201cThere are a lot of voices in Washington that are either sharply or harshly critical of China\u2019s actions in trade, in their military expansionism, in their actions in the South China Sea \u2014 fill in the blank,\u201d Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat senator from Delaware, said in an interview in Beijing late last month after meeting Chinese officials.\nMr. Xi\u2019s top economic official, Mr. Liu, a vice premier who leads the Chinese negotiators, could also suffer a setback in his standing if the latest talks falter.\n\u201cIf, say, Liu He comes back to Beijing empty-handed, and there\u2019s more tirades from Trump on his Twitter account, I think things could get really wild,\u201d Zhang Jian, an associate professor of government at Peking University, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s going to spill out of the economic waters.\u201d\nSome of the discord may stem from Chinese resistance to American calls for legislation that would prohibit a range of direct cash assistance to Chinese companies.\nChina has also opposed American requests to change China\u2019s cybersecurity law, counterterrorism law, and recently passed foreign investment law. Some of that legislation requires foreign companies to share sensitive information with the Chinese authorities and also requires them to use Chinese-approved equipment \u2014 and, therefore, probably Chinese-made equipment, which American companies and officials fear could be a security risk.\nJust over a week ago, the outlook for the trade negotiations seemed rosier. Chinese and American officials met in Beijing then for a 10th round of talks aimed at easing trade and economic tensions that spiked after Mr. Trump progressively imposed tariffs on $250 billion worth of goods last year.\nShortly before the talks last week started, the United States Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin said the negotiations were in their \u201cfinal laps.\u201d After the talks ended, he said on Twitter that they had been \u201cproductive.\u201d\nBut then Mr. Lighthizer and other Trump administration officials accused Chinese negotiators of trying to reverse concessions they had already made. The air of optimism evaporated.\nThe Trump officials said that China had retreated from draft agreements calling on its legislature to change laws that have threatened or constricted American trade and business. Two Chinese scholars in Beijing said they were told by well-placed officials that the changes in commitments appeared after Mr. Xi reviewed the draft deal. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal party matters.\nThe Chinese government disputed the claims of an underhanded rollback, saying Thursday it was normal for negotiating sides to disagree during talks. \u201cChina values trustworthiness and keeps its promises,\u201d Gao Feng, a spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce, said at a briefing. \u201cIt has never changed.\u201d\nThe Chinese have also complained about dealing with a mercurial president they say is apt to turn private disagreements into public brawls.\n\u201cTrump\u2019s personality is different, we all know,\u201d said Professor Tu. \u201cHe would take something that hasn\u2019t been settled in negotiations and treat it as so-called backsliding by China, or whatever, and then announce it.\n\u201cAn ordinary president,\u201d he said, \u201cwouldn\u2019t act this way.\u201d\nNegotiations with the United States have always been fraught for Chinese officials. Memories of bad blood linger.\nIn 1999, Zhu Rongji, then the vice premier, went to Washington hoping to reach a breakthrough deal that would open China\u2019s way to joining the World Trade Organization \u2014 only to have President Clinton balk.\nMr. Zhu returned to Beijing with his reputation damaged. A month later, the United States accidentally bombed China\u2019s embassy in Belgrade during NATO\u2019s war over Kosovo, igniting bitter protests against Washington across China. It took almost three more years before China joined the W.T.O.\nNow Mr. Xi must find a way to satisfy the Trump administration without appearing to give away too much. That could be more difficult if Mr. Trump continues to pelt Mr. Xi with demands on Twitter.\n\u201cI think the Chinese side is in an uncomfortable position, as they are reactive instead of controlling the situation as they are accustomed,\u201d said James L. McGregor, a consultant in Shanghai and former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China.\nThere are grave risks for both sides if the trade talks collapse entirely, many economists say.\nSome Chinese academics and business executives have already argued privately and online that Mr. Xi misjudged how far he could push Mr. Trump and promote China as a potential rival to the United States\u2019 dominance.\nMr. Trump, too, would not walk away unscathed. A breakdown in negotiations could weigh down American stock prices, which Mr. Trump invokes as a measure of his policy successes.\nEven if the talks in Washington end with handshakes and a new agreement, the past week has laid bare a lack of trust between China and the United States. Tensions over technology competition, spying, Taiwan, the South China Sea and other trouble spots could well up, said Professor Zhang, the Peking University academic.\n\u201cThe more important thing is not whether there\u2019s a deal or no deal,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the consensus in the American political class about China as a threat.\u201d", "date": "May 9, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/world/asia/xi-jinping-donald-trump.html", "tags": "american faces fold xi \u201c china dilemma double chinese trade could stall said talks"}
