Mr. Manafort will turn 70 in early April.\nDisputing the prosecutors\u2019 damning characterization of Mr. Manafort in a court filing last week, his lawyers insisted that Mr. Manafort was not only deeply remorseful, but \u201chas suffered almost unprecedented public shame\u201d for what they called garden-variety offenses. The memos are previews of the oral arguments that both sides will make before Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, who will sentence Mr. Manafort for the two conspiracy charges on March 13.\nJudge Jackson\u2019s sentence will come five days after Mr. Manafort is sentenced for eight more felonies he was found guilty of last year in a related financial fraud case before Judge T.S. Ellis III of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. A key question for both sides is whether Mr. Manafort will be allowed to serve the prison terms simultaneously, or whether they will be stacked atop each other.\nMr. Manafort\u2019s lawyers asked that Judge Jackson\u2019s sentence be \u201csignificantly below\u201d the 10-year maximum prison term she could impose. But whatever punishment she decides upon, they asked that Mr. Manafort be allowed to serve it concurrently with his sentence in the Virginia case. Under advisory sentencing guidelines, Mr. Manafort could be sentenced to more than 24 years in prison for the financial fraud scheme.\nThe defense team argued that had the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, never been appointed to investigate Russian interference in the election, \u201cMr. Manafort might never have been indicted in the District of Columbia.\u201d\nEven though Mr. Manafort has admitted his guilt in the conspiracy crimes, they said, Mr. Mueller\u2019s team had pursued him with unusual vigor because he led Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign during a critical period in 2016. He is one of the few defendants, they noted, to have ever been charged with a crime for failing to register as a foreign lobbyist with the Justice Department.\nIn their sentencing memo, unsealed on Saturday, Mr. Mueller\u2019s prosecutors asked for no specific sentence. But they said that Mr. Manafort had \u201crepeatedly and brazenly\u201d violated a host of laws for more than a decade, that he had admitted to leading a conspiracy that encompassed serious crimes including money-laundering and obstruction of justice, and that he should be sentenced to a substantial prison term.\nThe defense lawyers dismissed the prosecutors\u2019 argument that Mr. Manafort was likely to commit new crimes unless he received a lengthy sentence. \u201cThe special counsel\u2019s attempt to portray him as a lifelong and irredeemable felon is beyond the pale and grossly overstates the facts,\u201d they said. Mr. Manafort has been \u201cvilified in a manner that this country has not experienced in decades,\u201d they said.\nThey also suggested that Mr. Manafort should not be punished more harshly than Michael D. Cohen, the president\u2019s former lawyer and longtime fixer. Mr. Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison after he pleaded guilty to lying to Congress, five counts of tax evasion, one count of false submissions to a bank and two campaign finance violations.", "date": "Feb. 25, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/25/us/politics/paul-manafort-sentencing-memo.html", "tags": "vilified \u2018 sentencing sentence manafort judge paul \u201d prison lawyers district argue unfairly"}
