{"title": "Letter from Africa: 'We're not cleaners' - sexism amid Sudan protests", "content": "In our series of letters from African journalists, Zeinab Mohammed Salih considers why female protesters are angry with their male counterparts.\nThe anti-government protests in Sudan are unwavering despite a state of emergency imposed in February.\nThis is largely thanks to the efforts of the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), which has been organising the demonstrations against President Omar al-Bashir's nearly 30-year rule.\nThe body represents health workers, lawyers and teachers, amongst others - though some would argue, not women - even though it is estimated that more than 70% of the protesters who have been out on the streets since December are female.\nThe SPA got itself into hot water when it suggested that instead of a day of scheduled protests on Saturday 9 March, people come out instead to clean the streets.\nThe streets of the capital, Khartoum, are particularly mucky - and it was felt that a good tidy up would restore a sense of pride in the city.\nSince the protests began, the SPA has been particularly praised for the beautiful language used in its statements calling for action. \nHowever, in this instance it struck the wrong tone - urging women in particular to come out for the task because they \"cared more about cleaning\".\nThe message was met with outrage by many female protesters - and sparked a debate on social media about the sexism of the uprising.\nA day later, the SPA, which has female spokesperson, issued a contrite apology.\nThese protests began in reaction to a hike in bread prices - and then mushroomed into the most serious challenge to Mr Bashir's hold on power since an Islamist-backed coup in 1989.\nLikewise, the street-cleaning faux pas began as anger about the sexist attitudes of male protesters and has mushroomed into anger about how women are treated in Sudanese society.\nOn social media, comments such as \"even women have protested\" have been a particular point of contention.\nProtesting women are not a new phenomenon in Sudan. In 1946, 10 years before independence, the country's first female doctor, Khalida Zahir, took to the streets against British rule and was arrested and flogged. \nAnother sore point is the recent use of the word \"Kandaka\" to describe a female protester.\nKandaka was the word used to refers to queens in the ancient Kush kingdom that ruled Sudan thousands of years ago.\nThe literal translation from Arabic of the controversial SPA statement read: \"When is the cleaning day? On Saturday Kandaka - yes we mean you, because you care more about it.\"\nThe dislike for the term hinges on the fact that female protesters don't see themselves as above others - they are the people, taking the same risks as everyone else.\nThe irony of the word also angers others as they say there is no gender equality in the mainly Muslim country where female genital mutilation is still practised - almost 90% of Sudanese women have been cut.\nYou may also be interested in:\nWomen from all backgrounds and ages have been protesting - some on the frontline, others standing in front of their houses sheltering those who flee live ammunition or tear gas. \nThey have also been serving protesters with food and drinks. \nImages have also been circulating on social media of prominent men who support the government and have criticised the demonstrations, mocking them by feminising their faces on Photoshop. The implication is that they are cowards. \nThis has led a group of feminists to launch a campaign called \"Waqto wa naso\", meaning \"The time has come\", calling for such sexist attitudes to be denounced.\nAccording to the No To Women Oppression group, between 40,000 and 50,000 women are arrested and flogged each year by the police for flouting the country's Public Order Act introduced by Mr Bashir's government.\nThe law regulates what women can wear - they can, for example, be flogged for wearing clothes such as trousers that are considered indecent or simply for being out with men who are not their relatives.\nSudan's Public Order laws\nInterestingly, earlier this month a court overturned flogging sentences for nine women accused of taking part in protests.\nAnd the clean-up day in Khartoum did take place - with both men and women taking part.\nThese could perhaps be seen as signs of changing times for women in Sudan.\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica", "date": "1 April 2019", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-47738155?intlink_from_url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/topics/cq23pdgvgm8t/sudan&link_location=live-reporting-story", "tags": "letter cleaners female protests others protesters streets day africa sudan spa women also amid sexism"}
