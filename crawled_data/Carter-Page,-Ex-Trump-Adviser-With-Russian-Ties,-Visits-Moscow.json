Trump who was scrutinized by the F.B.I. on suspicion of private communications with senior Russian officials over the summer, was back in Moscow on Thursday.\nMr. Page was closelipped about the purpose of his visit, telling RIA Novosti, a Russian state-run news agency, that he would stay in Moscow until Tuesday and would meet with \u201cbusiness leaders and thought leaders.\u201d\nMr. Page, who founded an investment company in New York called Global Energy Capital, drew attention during the summer for a speech that criticized the United States and other Western nations for a \u201chypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization, inequality, corruption and regime change\u201d in Russia and in other parts of the former Soviet Union.\nHe worked as an investment banker in Russia for at least three years in the 2000s, advising on several major transactions involving Russian state companies. Mr. Page\u2019s extensive business links in Russia prompted suggestions that he might be serving Mr. Trump as a back-channel liaison with senior Kremlin officials.\nMr. Page dismissed the accusations, calling the F.B.I. investigation a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\nDmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin\u2019s spokesman, told journalists that government leaders in Moscow had no plans to meet with Mr. Page and that they had never had any contact with him. \u201cWe have learned about this from the press,\u201d Mr. Peskov told the news agency Interfax.\nRussia\u2019s deputy foreign minister, Sergei A. Ryabkov, said officials at his department had no plans to meet with Mr. Page.\nIn Russia\u2019s Parliament, Leonid E. Slutsky of the international affairs committee dismissed talk of Mr. Page as a foreign policy adviser to Mr. Trump, even though the American president-elect told the Washington Post editorial board in March that he was.\n\u201cHe is not Mr. Trump\u2019s adviser. He is an impostor who likes to make a lot of media noise about himself,\u201d Mr. Slutsky said.\nIn his previous visit to Moscow, in July, Mr. Page gave a speech at a graduation ceremony at the New Economic School, a Moscow university. At the time, he insisted that he had traveled to Russia as a private person.\nSpeaking to CNN in September, Kellyanne Conway, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager, said that Mr. Page was not part of the Trump team and that he was not authorized to speak to Russian officials on its behalf.", "date": "Dec. 8, 2016", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/08/world/europe/carter-page-donald-trump-moscow-russia.html", "tags": "visits carter adviser ex-trump officials russian \u201d moscow ties russia page foreign"}
