{"title": "The New 'Game Of Thrones' Teaser May Cause You To Freak Out- Here's Why You Shouldn't-", "content": "For everyone wondering: no, statues are not a good sign in the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d universe.\nSo far, the statues we have seen on the show (Lyanna\u2019s and Ned\u2019s in the Winterfell crypts) have served as symbols for people who are extremely dead. So after a new \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d final season teaser, which announced the Season 8 premiere date of April 14, 2019, featured Jon (Kit Harington), Arya (Maisie Williams) and Sansa (Sophie Turner) looking at statues of themselves in the Winterfell crypts as an icy, White Walker-like cold rolls in, it would be understandable if fans started to panic.\nBut don\u2019t.\nTurner actually teased the promo months ago during an interview/panel with EW at New York Comic-Con. In a discussion about the items cast members took home from set, Turner brought up a particular treasure she wanted from this promo \u2015\u00a0 and she made it clear she was mentioning it because it has \u201cnothing to do with the series.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s like this big kind of statue of me, of Sansa, and I wanted to have it in the garden of my new house,\u201d she said in the interview.\u00a0\nJust mentioning the statue in the interview, however, caused fans to speculate about\u00a0Sansa\u2019s possible death, but their concern is probably for naught.\nPerhaps Sansa dies in Season 8. Perhaps she doesn\u2019t. But the bottom line is that this promo isn\u2019t an indicator either way.\u00a0It\u2019s just a promo to remind us that the show is back in April. Winter is almost here.", "date": "\n01/13/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/new-game-of-thrones-teaser_n_5c37a867e4b0c469d76c57d8", "tags": "teaser freak may statues game cause out- thrones season \u201d sansa turner new promo"}
