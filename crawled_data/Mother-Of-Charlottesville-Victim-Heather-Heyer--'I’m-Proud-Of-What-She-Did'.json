{"title": "Mother Of Charlottesville Victim Heather Heyer- 'I\u2019m Proud Of What She Did'", "content": "RUCKERSVILLE, Va. \u2015 Susan Bro sat in her darkened home on Sunday, tearing up as she smiled.\nShe was thinking fondly of her daughter, 32-year-old Heather Heyer, who was killed in Charlottesville, Virginia, the day before, when a man drove his car into protesters\u00a0against the \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally, a gathering of white supremacist groups.\nHeather, a paralegal who lived in Charlottesville, was determined to stand up to injustice, her mother told HuffPost. There was no question that she would protest throngs of neo-Nazis and other extremists who had descended on her town.\n\u201cShe always had a very strong sense of right and wrong. She always, even as a child, was very caught up in what she believed to be fair,\u201d Bro said. \u201cSomehow I almost feel that this is what she was born to be, is a focal point for change.\u00a0I\u2019m proud that what she was doing was peaceful. She wasn\u2019t there fighting with people.\u201d\nShe recalled that her daughter was charitable and reached out to the underprivileged. Bro said Heather used to invite friends who were \u201chaving a hard time\u201d to stay with them, sometimes for months.\u00a0Anyone who needed help received it from Heather, Bro said.\nOthers who knew Heyer expressed similar sentiments.\u00a0A neighbor in Charlottesville told HuffPost that \u201cshe lived her life like her path \u2015 and it was for justice.\u201d A GoFundMe page set up in Heyer\u2019s name by a family friend said that Heyer was killed \u201cwhile protesting against hate.\u201d\u00a0\nVirginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) sent a message of support to Heyer\u2019s family and said that \u201cher bravery should inspire us all to come together.\u201d\nJames Fields Jr., 20, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder over the crash. Fields was in Charlottesville attending\u00a0the \u201cUnite the Right\u201d\u00a0rally and was photographed\u00a0with a shield bearing a white supremacist emblem hours before the attack.\n\u201cI think he\u2019s still very young, and I\u2019m sorry he believed that hate could fix problems. Hate only brings more hate,\u201d\u00a0Bro said. \u201cHeather was not about hate, Heather was about stopping hatred. Heather was about bringing an end to injustice.\nShe began to cry as she added, \u201cI don\u2019t want her death to be a focus for more hatred. I want her death to be a rallying cry for justice and equality and fairness and compassion. I\u2019m very sorry that [Fields] chose that path because he has now ruined his life as well as robbed a great many of us of someone we love very much.\u201d\n\u201cNo mother wants to lose a child, but I\u2019m proud of her,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m proud of what she did.\u201d\nFriends and colleagues echoed Bro\u2019s message.\n\u201cHeather was such a sweet soul, and she did not deserve to die,\u201d\u00a0Marissa Blair, a friend, told The New York Times. She was a \u201cvery strong woman\u201d who fought against \u201cany type of discrimination,\u201d added Alfred A. Wilson of the\u00a0Miller Law Group\u00a0in Charlottesville, where Heyer worked as a paralegal.\nShe had a knack for helping people in financial distress, said the firm\u2019s president, Larry Miller. The Miller Law Group handles bankruptcy and debt relief cases, among other matters.\n\u201cShe\u2019d hold their hand and make sure they would get the stuff in timely, that way we wouldn\u2019t have any issues,\u201d he told the Daily Beast. \u201cShe was really good at that.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThey a lot of times are embarrassed about having to do something like a bankruptcy,\u201d Miller said, \u201cand Heather was always saying, \u2018It\u2019s going to be OK.\u2019\u201d\nThe story has been updated with comments from Heather Heyer\u2019s friends and colleagues.", "date": "\n08/13/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mother-of-charlottesville-victim-heather-heyer-im-proud-of-what-she-did_n_59907c45e4b09071f69a796c", "tags": "victim mother hate heyer- \u201d heyer charlottesville told bro heather miller proud"}
