{"title": "China\u2019s Tactic to Catch a Fugitive Official: Hold His Two American Children", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 When Victor and Cynthia Liu landed with their mother on a tropical Chinese island in June to visit an ailing grandfather, they thought they would soon be on a plane back to their East Coast lives \u2014 he to start his sophomore year at Georgetown University, and she to work at the consulting firm McKinsey & Company in New York.\nInstead, within days, police officers detained their mother, Sandra Han, who, like her children, is an American citizen. They moved her to a secret site, commonly known as a black jail. The children discovered at the airport that they could not leave China, even though the police had said they were not being investigated or charged with a crime, the children told American officials and family associates.\nBy holding the family hostage, they said, the police are trying to force the siblings\u2019 father to return to China to face criminal charges. The father, Liu Changming, a former executive at a state-owned bank, is accused of being a central player in a $1.4 billion fraud case.\nThe children say their father severed ties with the family in 2012, but the Chinese authorities have still held them for months under a practice known as an exit ban \u2014 a growing tactic that has become the latest flash point in the increasingly rancorous relationship between the United States and China.\nSenior American diplomats, already contending with tensions over trade and territorial disputes, have denounced the way China uses exit bans as coercive, opaque and a violation of rights. In January, the State Department issued a travel warning, saying the practice posed risks to foreigners in China. Last month, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo criticized the bans during a visit to China, and this month he mentioned the Liu family to a top Chinese foreign policy official, Yang Jiechi, at a meeting in Washington.\nThe siblings have pleaded their case to American officials, including John R. Bolton, the national security adviser. \u201cThe investigative officers have made abundantly clear that neither my brother nor I am under any form of investigation,\u201d Ms. Liu, 27, wrote to Mr. Bolton in an August letter obtained by The New York Times. \u201cWe are being held here as a crude form of human collateral to induce someone with whom I have no contact to return to China for reasons with which I am entirely unfamiliar.\u201d\nShe made similar points in an email sent in recent days to a family associate, saying that \u201cthe Chinese authorities have been consistent that neither Victor nor I are accused of or suspected of any criminal activity,\u201d and that the authorities have repeatedly said that \u201cthe reason we are here is exclusively to lure\u201d their father.\nOn Friday, in response to questions from The Times, a State Department spokesman, Robert Palladino, said the United States would continue expressing concern about exit bans \u201cuntil we see a transparent and fair process.\u201d\nThe Chinese Foreign Ministry defended the holding of the three family members, saying: \u201cThe people you mentioned all own legal and valid identity documents as Chinese citizens. Because they are suspected of economic crimes, they are restricted from exiting the country by the Chinese police in accordance with the law.\u201d\nThis account of the Liu family\u2019s plight is based on interviews with administration and congressional officials, university employees and family associates, as well as correspondence by the children to them and public records. There are currently a handful of exit-ban cases involving Americans, but this is the first one in which those with knowledge of it are making the details public.\nIt is also a rare instance in which one of those being held \u2014 Mr. Liu, 19 \u2014 was born in the United States. More often, China imposes exit bans, which can last from days to years, on naturalized foreign citizens who were born in China. Security officers often treat them as if they were still Chinese citizens, even though China does not recognize dual nationality.\nThe law in China states that its nationals automatically lose their citizenship when they gain citizenship in another country. It also says that someone like Mr. Liu who is born with citizenship from another nation is not a Chinese citizen, no matter the parents\u2019 citizenship.\nThe Liu family members all entered China on American passports, and the State Department is providing them with citizen services. The police from Guangzhou, the southern provincial capital where the father worked, have taken Ms. Han, 51, to a hotel several times to meet with an American consular officer.\nLiu Changming, 53, the father, is among China\u2019s most-wanted fugitives, accused of helping to carry out one of the country\u2019s biggest bank frauds, in which $1.4 billion in illegal loans was issued to property developers. He fled the country in 2007.\nIn recent years, as the Chinese authorities have waged a fierce crackdown on corruption, they have increasingly viewed family members of corrupt officials as being tied to the illegal acts, with the police sometimes aiming to prosecute spouses.\nThe Liu family has lived with notable wealth in the United States, in part by acquiring real estate, though there is no indication from public records that the properties were purchased with the money that the father is accused of embezzling.\nSenator Elizabeth Warren, Senator Edward J. Markey and Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III, Democrats from Massachusetts, where the mother lives, have urged the United States government to act.\n\u201cOur office is aware of Victor\u2019s, Cynthia\u2019s and Sandra\u2019s situations and is deeply concerned,\u201d Mr. Markey\u2019s office said in a statement. \u201cWe are working to secure their safe return and continue to be in touch with U.S. officials to ensure a positive outcome.\u201d\nThe Liu children are trapped in a situation far from their elite American lives. Both attended Groton, an expensive Massachusetts boarding school. Ms. Liu graduated from Stanford and Harvard Business School. The family has a $2.3 million house in a Boston suburb, and the mother, a businesswoman, controls or has her name on companies with real estate holdings worth at least $10 million, including two luxury apartments in Manhattan, according to public records.\nSince June, the children have tried to leave China three times. They travel between cities, staying in hotels or with an uncle. Their ailing grandfather died in October. They limit their electronic communications because of suspected surveillance.\n\u201cOut of concern for the security of these young Americans, we will refrain from public comment as we continue our efforts to constructively and directly engage the Chinese government to allow them to return home,\u201d said David Pressman, a partner at the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner who is representing the Liu children.\nThe Georgetown president met with the children this month in Beijing. Harvard has written to the Chinese ambassador in Washington. McKinsey is in touch with Ms. Liu. People tracking the case say they hope President Trump will raise the issue at the Group of 20 summit meeting this week in Argentina, where he and Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, are expected to meet.\nChina has convicted foreigners of crimes and even executed them. It has also detained Muslims who are foreign citizens in its northwest internment camp system. The exit bans are different \u2014 the authorities do not keep the people at a detention site or present a legal justification. They use the ban mainly as a means of coercion: to squeeze out information, to compel a relative or friend to return to China, or to force the victim to settle a business dispute.\nIn one case, an American stayed in China under an exit ban for more than two years. A continuing case involves a Singaporean national working for UBS, the Swiss bank, which has prompted UBS to issue travel warnings to its employees.\n\u201cMany police actions are now taken outside the legal system, and both Chinese citizens and foreigners, especially those who used to be Chinese citizens, have been kept in China with no apparent legal authority,\u201d said Jerome A. Cohen, a law professor at New York University.\nChina\u2019s increasing use of the practice is a result of major trends: a growing disregard for civil rights among Chinese security forces; a sweeping anti-corruption campaign started by Mr. Xi in 2012; and a rush among corrupt officials and executives to move overseas with their families. In 2014, China announced the start of a global campaign to hunt down fugitive former officials.\nMany of the former officials live overseas in luxury, with new names and citizenship. China has sent secret agents to the United States to try to retrieve some. China has also asked the United States to send back former officials, but the two countries do not have an extradition treaty.\nAmerican officials have been reluctant to cooperate because of China\u2019s human rights abuses and lack of rule of law, though there have been exceptions \u2014 including the repatriation of a former vice mayor accused of stealing $39 million.\nIn 2007, Chinese auditors closed in on what was becoming the country\u2019s biggest bank fraud case. Liu Changming fled China that December, state media reported. The top official at the Guangzhou branch of the Bank of Communications, he was at the center of the case.\nOfficials charged him in 2008 with making illegal loans of about 9.8 billion yuan, or $1.4 billion, including some to a company he secretly controlled, according to Caixin, a financial newsmagazine. Officials convicted Mr. Liu\u2019s co-conspirators but recovered only half of the money.\nIn 2015, China put Mr. Liu on its \u201cSkynet\u201d list of 100 most-wanted fugitives. Interpol issued a \u201cred notice\u201d for his arrest. His whereabouts are unknown.\nThe Financial Times reported in 2009 that after escaping China, Mr. Liu took part in shareholder meetings in London for Canton Property Investment Ltd., a company whose Chinese subsidiaries received the illegal loans. The company had gone public in London in August 2007 and raised $50 million, but was delisted the next year.\nPublic records show that a person named Changming Liu is linked to a home in Chestnut Hill, Mass. The address matches the one Cynthia Liu lists on her Harvard alumni page. The home is owned by Sandra Han, the mother. Zillow, the real estate website, estimates its value at $2.3 million.\nA company controlled by Ms. Han bought the home in 2009. Several real estate companies, trusts and limited liability corporations are registered to that address, and they in turn own rental properties in Massachusetts and luxury apartments in New York.\nWhile Mr. Liu was moving up the ranks of China\u2019s banking bureaucracy, he became what the Chinese call a \u201cnaked official\u201d \u2014 someone who settles his family abroad, with relatively easy paths to foreign citizenship and well-regarded schools, and with the Chinese authorities an ocean away.\nThe mother and daughter moved to California in 1998, and by early the next year they lived in a condominium in Alhambra, a Los Angeles suburb popular with Chinese immigrants. In June 1999, Mr. Liu and his wife bought a three-bedroom home in nearby Arcadia. Records show they obtained Social Security numbers in California around this time.\nTheir son Victor was born in California that July. He later lived in southern Chinese cities for five years, leaving Guangzhou in 2007.\nThe couple sold the Arcadia home in 2004 and bought a house in a gated community in Armonk, N.Y., an affluent town, records show. The home was transferred to Cynthia Liu\u2019s name in 2011 and sold in 2014 for almost $900,000.\nMs. Han is a trustee of an entity called Bountiful Success Trust \u2014 2014, which bought a $2.77 million condominium in downtown Manhattan in 2016. Another company she controls owns a unit at the Lucida on the Upper East Side that Zillow values at $4.17 million.\nLike his mother and sister, Victor Liu is interested in business, and he rented a room this summer with Noor Darwish, his first-year roommate, in a Georgetown home to do an internship at his university\u2019s endowment office. But he left suddenly in June. He called Mr. Darwish as he was leaving the country.\n\u201cHe told me he had some family problems, and that his grandfather had had a heart attack,\u201d Mr. Darwish said.\nThe university has strongly pushed for the siblings\u2019 release. On his trip to China this month, the Georgetown president, John J. DeGioia, met with senior officials. With him was Evan S. Medeiros, a professor who had helped negotiate releases of American hostages in North Korea as senior Asia director in President Barack Obama\u2019s National Security Council.\nThe university has a little-known connection to China\u2019s leadership. A nephew of Mr. Xi, China\u2019s president, is a recent graduate of Georgetown\u2019s School of Foreign Service. While at Georgetown, he also interned at the Brookings Institution.\nNone of that has helped. With winter break looming, Mr. Liu\u2019s friends on campus are asking why he has been absent all semester. \u201cOur room is a lot lonelier now,\u201d Mr. Darwish said.\nIn China, Mr. Liu has been eating and sleeping poorly. His sister mentioned concerns about her own health in her letter to the White House. She wrote, \u201cWe feel alone, angry, and most of all afraid, and more than anything, we just want to come home.\u201d", "date": "Nov. 25, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/25/us/politics/china-exit-ban.html", "tags": "american hold officials china \u201d official fugitive chinese two children liu catch tactic family \u2014"}
