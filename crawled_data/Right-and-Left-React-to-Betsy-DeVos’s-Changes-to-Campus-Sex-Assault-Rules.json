Read more \u00bb\n_____\nKarol Markowicz in The New York Post:\nMs. Markowicz defends the reforms to Title IX introduced by Ms. Devos by condemning the \u201cutterly unfair procedures\u201d common under the Obama-era system. Under the previous system, she writes, \u201c\u2018defendants\u2019 don\u2019t get lawyers. Due process, of the sort we\u2019re used to in real courts, is tossed by the wayside.\u201d She concludes her column by noting that \u201cwe wouldn\u2019t allow women to be treated this way.\u201d Read more \u00bb\n_____\nLucia Graves in The Guardian:\nAccording to Ms. Graves, it all comes down to the fact that Ms. DeVos \u201cis simply defending the people she and her boss have always been most interested in defending,\u201d white men \u201cwho\u2019d grown used to having the world at their feet.\u201d Read more \u00bb\n_____Ruth Marcus in The Washington Post:\n\u201cThere is every reason not to trust\u201d Ms. DeVos and the Trump administration when it comes to policing sexual assault on college campuses, writes Ms. Marcus. However, she still finds herself praising \u2014 \u201calbeit tentatively and preliminarily\u201d \u2014 the education secretary\u2019s attempt to address the \u201cseriously flawed\u201d way in which colleges handled assault investigations, an \u201covercorrection\u201d in response to the Obama administration\u2019s attempts to get colleges to \u201ctake sexual-assault allegations seriously.\u201d Read more \u00bb\n_____\nChristina Cauterucci in Slate:\nMs. Cauterucci argues that many of President Trump\u2019s policies require \u201cpretty impressive feats of intellectual dissonance. Police officers should rough up the suspects they arrest, but universities should go easy on accused rapists.\u201d The only thread connecting these seemingly contradictory policy priorities, including the most recent Title IX decision, is that of identity, \u201chis identity as a white man and his desire to protect the same.\u201d Read more \u00bb\n_____\nEmily Yoffe in The Atlantic:\nMany of the writers featured in this roundup have cited Ms. Yoffe\u2019s reporting on how the rules adjudicating college sexual assault have changed in recent years. The first installment of this three-part series addresses how students accused of assault lose their due-process rights when universities handle cases in accordance to Obama-era federal rules. \u201cThese directives,\u201d she writes, \u201chave left a mess of a system, and many unintended consequences.\u201d Read more \u00bb\nYou can read part two of the series, about the \u201cbad science\u201d of the physiology of trauma and its role in sexual assault cases, here.\nPart three explores whether campus sexual assault cases are biased against men of color. You can read it here.\n_____\nChristina Hoff Sommers in The Chronicle of Higher Education:\nMs. Sommers, who is best described as a classical liberal feminist, had little optimism for how Republicans would handle women\u2019s issues. \u201cI used to wonder what was worse,\u201d she writes, \u201cRepublican politicians ignoring women\u2019s issues or Republican politicians talking about them.\u201d However, Ms. Sommers lauds Ms. DeVos\u2019s \u201copenness\u201d and \u201cfair and transparent procedure\u201d in reforming Title IX procedures in cases of sexual assault. Perhaps, she writes, it will signal \u201ca rare occasion for bipartisan cooperation.\u201d Read more \u00bb\n_____\nThe editorial board of The Dallas Morning News:\nAs skeptics that victims of sexual assault \u201cwill be as fairly treated\u201d as they were under Obama-era Title IX protections, the members of The Dallas Morning News editorial board also \u201cwelcome a constructive conversation about unintended consequences or confusion resulting from the 2011 guidelines.\u201d The only thing that gives the group temporary comfort is that \u201cnothing changes today.\u201d The rules remain in place during a notice-and-comment period.
