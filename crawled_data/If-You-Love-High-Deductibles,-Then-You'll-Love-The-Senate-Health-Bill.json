{"title": "If You Love High Deductibles, Then You'll Love The Senate Health Bill", "content": "The deductibles are too high. \nYou\u2019ve heard consumers say this about their health insurance policies, particularly in the last few years since Obamacare became law. And if you\u2019ve been paying attention to politics, then you\u2019ve heard Republicans promise to bring those deductibles down. \nNow Senate Republicans have officially released their proposal to repeal the Affordable Care Act and, based on the available information, they are going to break that promise in a very big way. If the GOP proposal becomes law, then it\u2019s likely out-of-pocket costs for people buying\u00a0coverage through healthcare.gov or one of the state exchanges would tend to be higher, not lower \u2015 unless these people were able and willing to pay even more in premiums.\nThe explanation is wonky, and the verdict is not definitive because the Congressional Budget Office and other independent experts haven\u2019t had a chance to produce detailed projections yet. But it doesn\u2019t take a formal analysis to understand what Republicans are trying to do here.\nThe essential reality of the repeal effort \u2015 one worth keeping in mind over the next few days, amid all the legislative negotiation over policy details \u2015 is that Republicans want to reduce\u00a0government spending on the poor and middle class. And less government spending for these people means, almost inevitably, that they will pay for a greater portion of their medical care. \nEither fewer will have insurance, the insurance they have will offer less protection, or both.\u00a0It\u2019s just a question of who suffers and how.\nToday, with the Affordable Care Act still in place, people who buy coverage on their own (rather than through an employer)\u00a0are eligible for tax credits that offset the cost of their premiums. The size of the tax credit varies depending on income, age and the price of a typical policy in a community. The idea is to make sure people who have the least money or face the highest premiums get the most help.\nIf the Senate bill becomes law, people buying coverage on their own would still be eligible for tax credits and, superficially, those credits would function a lot like the ones in place now. The value would go up or down depending on personal income, age and the price of the typical local plan. But the Senate bill alters the definition of \u201ctypical\u201d \u2015 or, to put it as the health care experts do, it redefines the benchmark for setting subsidy levels. \nThat\u2019s a big deal.\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, the benchmark plan is a \u201csilver\u201d plan. Silver plans have an \u201cactuarial value\u201d (AV) of 70, which means they should cover roughly 70 percent of the typical person\u2019s medical expenses. Under the Senate proposal, the benchmark plan would be a policy with an AV of 58 \u2015 in other words, a plan that would cover just 58 percent of the typical person\u2019s medical expenses. That\u2019s pretty close to what, under the Affordable Care Act, qualifies as a \u201cbronze\u201d plan.\u00a0\u00a0\nBronze plans have lower premiums than silver plans because they cover less. And so using a quasi-bronze plan as the benchmark rather than a silver plan means reducing the financial assistance people get to buy insurance.\nOne way to think about it is a straightforward reduction in the subsidies. Larry Levitt, senior vice president at the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, said it\u2019s basically equivalent to a 15 percent across-the-board subsidy reduction.\u00a0\nAnother way to think about the difference is to think about the kinds of plans these diminished subsidies are supposed to buy.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn 2016, the median deductible in a silver plan on healthcare.gov was $3,500 a year, according to the Center on Medicare and Medicaid Services. This, roughly speaking, is the plan that Obamacare is designed to help consumers get. In 2016, the median deductible in a bronze plan on healthcare.gov was $6,300. This \u2015 again, roughly speaking \u2015 is the plan that Senate Republicans want to help consumers get.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s a huge difference. And it\u2019d be even bigger for low-income consumers because, under current law, they are eligible to buy special plans with even lower out-of-pocket spending. The federal government makes this possible by paying insurers extra to offer these plans.\nUnder the Senate bill, the federal government would stop doing that, meaning that low-income consumers would be choosing from the same menu of plans and would be exposed to the very same out-of-pocket costs as higher income consumers.\u00a0\nSomebody making $20,000 a year could easily see deductibles increase dramatically, from $1,000 (the average deductible for lowest-income consumers in 2016, according to Aviva Aron-Dine of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities) up to that $6,300 average. And for somebody at that income level\u00a0\u2015 think a home care worker or retail clerk barely covering costs like food and rent \u2015 even modestly higher out-of-pocket medical costs would be crippling.\u00a0\nThe Senate bill does make other changes to the tax credit formula, and it invites states to seek waivers that would eliminate some of the existing regulations that affect the kinds of plans insurers offer.\u00a0Some people would likely end up saving money, either on premiums or out-of-pocket costs or both, and it\u2019s an open question how this all works out for the millions of people who buy coverage directly from insurers rather than through the exchanges. Next week\u2019s Congressional Budget Office analysis should help clarify that.\nBut on the exchanges, at least, the Senate bill \u201ccuts tax credits for virtually all consumers by linking them to less generous coverage,\u201d Aron-Dine says, adding, \u201cFor most of the roughly 9 million people who get subsidized coverage today, that would mean a choice. Pay significantly more in premiums to keep similar coverage, or keep premiums similar with much higher deductibles,\u201d\u00a0\nNone of this should be surprising. A core principle of conservative health policy is that people should face higher out-of-pocket expenses \u2015 that they should have \u201cmore skin in the game\u201d \u2015 because, in theory, people would shop more aggressively for better prices or simply avoid getting medical care.\u00a0\nFor the last few years, Republican politicians acted\u00a0as if they felt differently, and it\u2019s entirely possible many of them had no idea that, by campaigning to reduce out-of-pocket costs, they were deviating from this bedrock piece of conservative orthodoxy. \nIt will be interesting to see how these Republicans react once they grasp what the leadership\u2019s plan would actually do \u2015 assuming there\u2019s enough time for that reality to sink in.\u00a0", "date": "\n06/22/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/senate-obamacare-repeal-bill-higher-deductibles_n_594c1f52e4b05c37bb753c04", "tags": "care out-of-pocket consumers coverage high plans \u2015 senate bill deductibles love plan health"}
