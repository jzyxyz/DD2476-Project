{"title": "Trumpcare Is Coming To Iowa, And Your State May Be Next", "content": "Republicans could not repeal the Affordable Care Act last year, and they seem unlikely to try again anytime soon. But they are finding places where, through a combination of new state laws and new federal regulations, they can transform Obamacare\u2019s health insurance markets into something more to their liking \u2015 namely, markets full of cheaper, less generous plans available to people in good health. \nThis week, Iowa became one of those places. Kim Reynolds, the state\u2019s Republican governor,\u00a0signed a law Monday allowing the Iowa Farm Bureau to sell health plans that, in most respects, look and operate like any other insurance policies. Wellmark, the state\u2019s affiliate of Blue Cross Blue Shield, will administer the new policies.\nBut the legislation declares that the new plans \u201cshall not be deemed to be insurance,\u201d and there\u2019s a reason for that. Iowa\u2019s lawmakers want to make sure the policies aren\u2019t subject to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s insurance regulations, including those that protect people with pre-existing conditions. \nUnless a court challenge gets in the way, nothing will stop the Farm Bureau and Wellmark from jacking up premiums on people with conditions such as cancer and diabetes \u2015 or denying those people coverage altogether. Nor will anything keep\u00a0the plan sponsors from limiting or excluding benefits the Affordable Care Act considers \u201cessential,\u201d a list that includes treatment for mental illness, maternity care and prescription drugs. \nAnd if the Farm Bureau and Wellmark want to impose annual or lifetime limits on benefits, they can do that, too.\u00a0People\u00a0who receive organ transplants or have rare genetic disorders, such as\u00a0hemophilia,\u00a0frequently run up bills that exceed those limits.\u00a0\nSo far, officials from the Farm Bureau and Wellmark have not specified exactly how much of this leeway they plan to use. But they have said that the policies will look like the ones that were available before the Affordable Care Act took effect. Those plans had substantially lower premiums precisely because they [were] not available or terribly useful to people with serious medical problems. \u201cWe do know that this may not be a solution for all,\u201d a Farm Bureau spokesperson conceded to the Des Moines Register.\nAlthough the legislation\u2019s supporters don\u2019t typically advertise that downside, the more candid ones acknowledge it. They argue it\u2019s a necessary trade-off because premiums for Iowans who buy coverage on their own, rather than through employers, have increased to the point that many simply cannot afford it today.\nThat\u2019s true. People with incomes below four times the poverty line, or roughly $49,000 for an individual, qualify for the Affordable Care Act\u2019s tax credits. These people represent the majority of people buying on their own, and, for them, coverage tends to be within reach and sometimes even free, no matter how high premiums get.\u00a0But the tax credits get smaller at higher incomes, and those who are above the subsidy threshold must pay full price. This is particularly rough on people in their 50s and 60s because, even under the Affordable Care Act, insurers can charge older customers up to three times more than they charge younger ones.\nIowa is a state where the differential is particularly striking.\u00a0A 55-year-old single man in Des Moines with an annual income of $35,000 can get coverage through HealthCare.gov and pay less than $700 in annual premiums for it, thanks to the tax credits. A 55-year-old with an income of $55,000 has to pay full price, which works out to more than $11,000 a year. \nIn public appearances and interviews with media outlets, including HuffPost, GOP leaders have repeatedly blamed this situation on the design of Affordable Care Act, with Reynolds calling it \u201cunaffordable, unsustainable and unworkable.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not just that the law\u2019s requirements have made insurance more expensive, Reynolds and her fellow Republicans say; it\u2019s that the high prices have driven healthy people out of the market, saddling insurers with big losses. The carriers have responded by raising premiums even higher or simply fleeing,\u00a0which is why this year just one carrier, Minnesota-based Medica, offers policies through HealthCare.gov.\nThat is, more or less, how the market in Iowa has evolved. But the problems have at least as much to do with decisions by the state\u2019s political and business leaders as they do with the health care law\u2019s design.\nRepublican Terry Branstad, Reynolds\u2019 predecessor as governor, was another outspoken critic of Obamacare. His administration did virtually nothing to promote enrollment, even though, given the state\u2019s small size, adding just a few thousand people to the rolls could have made the market more stable. As of 2016, just 20 percent of Iowans eligible to get plans through HealthCare.gov had signed up, according to figures compiled by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. That was the lowest of any state, well below the national average of 40 percent.\nThose numbers aren\u2019t simply a byproduct of poor outreach. An unusually large number of Iowans are holding on to \u201cgrandfathered\u201d or \u201ctransitional\u201d plans \u2015 policies that existed before the Affordable Care Act took effect and that remain cheap, mainly because they originally enrolled people who were in relatively good health. As of last year, these holdover policies accounted for more than half the total market, according to estimates by Charles Gaba, the Michigan-based policy analyst and proprietor of the website ACAsignups.net.\nThe Obama administration is partly responsible for this: It gave state officials discretion over whether to allow the transitional plans and for how long. But Iowa is among the states where officials have made maximum use of that discretion. One reason may be the political power of Wellmark, the state\u2019s dominant insurer, which happens to operate the old plans.\nEnrollment in those old noncompliant plans was bound to dwindle eventually, as people found different sources of coverage, either through new jobs or, perhaps, reaching the age to qualify for Medicare.\u00a0Now that isn\u2019t going to happen. Instead, a new class of cheap, noncompliant plans will be open to new enrollees. The policies will likely draw people in good health away from the policies available on HealthCare.gov,\u00a0driving premiums there even higher. (It may or may not be sheer coincidence that Wellmark will operate the new plans, too.) \nIowans whose incomes qualify for the law\u2019s tax credits may not notice the difference. They\u2019ll still be able to get comprehensive, regulated policies through HealthCare.gov, usually at low prices. And Iowans with higher incomes, the ones who didn\u2019t get the tax credits, will discover they have a much cheaper alternative. Many will feel genuine relief, even if the plans don\u2019t provide as much coverage.\nBut some Iowans have pre-existing conditions, which means they won\u2019t be able to buy the new plans. Others will sign up for a Farm Bureau-Wellmark policy, get sick and then require care that\u2019s beyond what the plans cover. They will be in trouble.\nAnd it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. \nIn Alaska and Minnesota, state officials faced remarkably similar situations, with premiums that put insurance out of reach for consumers who got little or no financial aid. They responded very differently than their counterparts in Des Moines. They created \u201creinsurance\u201d pools that reimburse carriers for their most expensive-to-cover beneficiaries. Premiums fell in both states, and just this past week officials in Wisconsin\u00a0said they were going to try the same thing.\nIowa\u2019s GOP leaders could have tried some version of that. They also could have launched, finally, a serious outreach effort to boost enrollment.\n \u201cThese are places where there are opportunities to grow and consolidate the risk pool,\u201d Sarah Lueck, a senior policy analyst at the progressive Center on Budget and Policy Priorities think tank, told HuffPost. Lueck, who happens to be an Iowa native, has studied the state closely and calls the outreach failure \u201ca huge missed opportunity.\u201d\nThere were more ambitious options, too, like opening up Medicaid to individual buyers or creating state tax credits to supplement the existing federal ones. These ideas, which have come up for discussion in other states,\u00a0would have entailed their own trade-offs \u2015 including, most likely, additional government spending. That\u2019s true of reinsurance, as well. But the sums would be relatively modest, depending on the option, and all would leave in place those protections for pre-existing conditions.\nBut preserving those protections is not a priority for most Republicans, at either the state or the federal level.\u00a0They would prefer to reduce health insurance premiums by letting insurers cover fewer services and exclude people with serious medical problems. And they are trying their best to realize that vision \u2015 by, for example, encouraging enrollment in short-duration insurance plans that aren\u2019t subject to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s requirements. \nAs long as the Affordable Care Act remains on the books, millions of low- and middle-income individuals will continue to get comprehensive, subsidized insurance they wouldn\u2019t have otherwise \u2015 and, most likely, have better access to care as a result. That\u2019s especially true in states where leaders are more enthusiastic about making the program work. \nBut in other parts of the country, and for certain groups of people, buying health insurance is going to look a lot like it was before the Affordable Care Act. Cheap insurance will be available, as long as you are healthy, and it will take care of you just fine, just as long as you stay that way.", "date": "\n04/08/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/obamacare-iowa-wellmark-premiums-gop_n_5ac7d007e4b0337ad1e802c6", "tags": "next may trumpcare iowa premiums coming insurance act policies state affordable plans new care"}
