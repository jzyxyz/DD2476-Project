Bernie Sanders\u2019\u00a0televised town hall on Tuesday night to promote single-payer health care, or \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d drew a live audience of about 1.1 million people \u2015 all but a few hundred of whom viewed the event online.\nFor Sanders, whose single-payer health care legislation elicited the support of over one-third of the Senate Democratic Caucus, the 90-minute broadcast at the U.S. Capitol visitors center was an opportunity to promote a top policy priority while thumbing his nose at the \u201ccorporate media.\u201d\n\u201cThis is the first Medicare for all town meeting held in our nation\u2019s capital. This is the first nationally televised town meeting on Medicare for all,\u201d Sanders said in his introductory remarks. \u201cAnd very importantly, this is the first nationally televised Senate town meeting that is taking place outside of corporate media.\u201d\nThe Vermont senator is a frequent critic of mainstream news outlets for their alleged focus on superficial political matters and failure to entertain narratives that threaten their corporate owners. Although Sanders has participated in more than one live health care debate on CNN, he told The Washington Post earlier this month that a large media network failed to respond to his inquiries about a broadcast solely on the topic of government-provided health care coverage.\nBut Sanders\u2019 town hall, which was co-hosted by the left-leaning online video news outlets The Young Turks, NowThis and ATTN, demonstrated that a lengthy seminar on the complicated topic of single-payer health care can draw a crowd as large as many primetime cable news shows.\nThe auditorium itself was packed to capacity with some 450 attendees. And together, the live audiences on the senator\u2019s Facebook and YouTube pages, the the three news sites and some other outlets that picked up the stream added up to about 1.1 million people.\nThe event consisted of three expert panel discussions moderated by Sanders: the first discussing problems with the current American health care system; the second on the potential economic impact of a \u201cMedicare for all\u201d program; and the third comparing the American health care system with those in other countries. Each of the three segments also featured questions from the live audience and video queries submitted online.\nSince revealing his new single-payer bill in September, Sanders has doggedly promoted it. In October, he even toured top-flight health care facilities in Toronto\u00a0to showcase the achievements of the single-payer system in Canada.\nSome of Sanders\u2019 guests on Tuesday, including Richard Masters, the pro-single payer CEO of MCS, a Pennsylvania-based picture frame maker, and Dr. Claudia Fegan, chief medical officer for the Cook County Health and Hospital System in Chicago, were veterans of his legislative rollout and his Canada trip, respectively.\nOther guests were new \u2015 like Dr. Donald Berwick, a Harvard medical school professor who led the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in the Obama administration \u2015 reflecting the steady progress of Sanders\u2019 cause into the mainstream. As one of the Democratic Party\u2019s premier health policy experts and technocrats, Berwick\u2019s imprimatur is a major asset.\nWhen Sanders asked whether there was any good reason not to expand Medicare, Berwick replied, \u201cNo, there\u2019s no reason. It\u2019s just will.\u201d\nBerwick described how Medicare\u2019s public mission and centralized bargaining power, as the insurer for some 55 million Americans, allowed him to easily troubleshoot problems like the over-sedation of nursing home patients.\n\u201cYou can stand up for people,\u201d Berwick recalled of his position at Medicare\u2019s helm. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t we do that for all Americans, not just people over 65?\u201d\nSanders relished the opportunity to tee panelists up with knowing questions that knocked down conservative straw man arguments against single-payer health care.\nThe exercise was likely most useful for hardened single-payer advocates looking for a pep rally and for center-left Americans concerned about health care affordability who haven\u2019t settled on a policy framework to explain the system\u2019s problems. It is less predictable how Sanders\u2019 pitch would fare with more skeptical health care consumers.\nAs Sanders is fond of noting, polling shows that a majority of Americans support single-payer health care.\nBut nearly half of Americans get health coverage from an employer, and they\u2019d be forced to give up what they have and pay higher taxes for an expanded version of Medicare that might not produce promised cost savings overnight. The passage of the Affordable Care Act provoked hysteria through its cancellation of some 400,000 individuals\u2019 health care plans; there is no telling how people would react to a forced transition of much greater proportions.\nBut Sanders, who has been campaigning for single-payer health care since he first entered Congress in 1991, is betting that the movement is finally accelerating.\u00a0What makes the current moment different, he argued, is that the same digital revolution that made his campaign possible also allows progressives to communicate directly with the public.\n\u201cThe reason we\u2019re doing this program tonight is you don\u2019t see this stuff,\u201d he said in his concluding remarks. \u201cIt ain\u2019t gonna be on CBS. It ain\u2019t gonna be on NBC.\u201d\n\u201cWhat astounds me is we already have a pretty good majority of the American people who already believe in universal health care, believe that it is the government\u2019s responsibility to make sure that health care is a right,\u201d\u00a0Sanders added. \u201cAnd we have reached that stage with media not talking about the issue at all.\u201d", "date": "\n01/24/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-medicare-for-all-town-hall_n_5a680274e4b0dc592a0dbcf6", "tags": "care single-payer \u2018 live first draws town \u201d online bernie viewers hall sanders million medicare health"}
