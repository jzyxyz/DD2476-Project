{"title": "Rep- Ted Lieu Plays Candace Owens' Hitler Remarks During White Nationalism Hearing", "content": "During a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Tuesday where conservative commentator Candace Owens testified,\u00a0Rep.\u00a0Ted Lieu\u00a0(D-Calif.) made waves when he played a 2018 recording of Owens arguing that what Adolf Hitler practiced wasn\u2019t really \u201cnationalism.\u201d\nRepublicans had invited Owens to the hearing, which was about the rising tide of white nationalism and hate crimes. The Fox News contributor used her time to talk about everything from Brexit to anti-fascist activists. She also claimed that discussing white nationalism at all is simply a Democratic ploy to win elections.\nWhen Lieu spoke, he took a moment to remind everyone of comments Owens made a few months ago about Hitler.\n\u201cIn congressional hearings, the minority party gets to select its own witnesses. And of all the people that Republicans could have selected, they picked Candace Owens,\u201d Lieu said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know Miss Owens. I\u2019m not going to characterize her. I\u2019m going to let her own words do the talking,\u201d he went on. \u201cI\u2019m going to play for you the first 30 seconds of a statement she made about Adolf Hitler.\u201d Lieu then pressed play on a video of Owen speaking at an event with Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk\u00a0in December.\nAt that event, as heard in Lieu\u2019s video, Owens said she didn\u2019t \u201chave any problems at all with the word \u2018nationalism.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cWhenever we say nationalism, the first thing people think about, at least in America, is Hitler,\u201d she said in December. \u201cThe problem is that he wanted \u2014 he had dreams outside of Germany. He wanted to globalize. He wanted everybody to be German, everybody to be speaking German. Everybody to look a different way.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not, to me, that\u2019s not nationalism,\u201d she went on. \u201cIn thinking about how we could go bad down the line, I don\u2019t really have an issue with nationalism. I really don\u2019t. I think that it\u2019s OK.\u201d\nAfter Lieu played the video, he asked Owen\u2019s co-panelist, Anti-Defamation League executive Eileen Hershenov: \u201cSo, when people try to legitimize Adolf Hitler, does that feed into white nationalist ideology?\u201d\nHershenov told Lieu that \u201cit does.\u201d She said that while \u201cMrs. Owens distanced herself from those comments later,\u201d the League \u201cexpressed great concern over the original comments.\u201d\nOwens, when given an opportunity to respond, said \u201cit\u2019s pretty apparent that Mr. Lieu believes that black people are stupid and will not pursue the full clip in its entirety.\u201d\n\u201cHe purposely presented an extracted clip... He\u2019s trying to present as if I was launching a defense of Hitler in Germany,\u201d she said. \u201cI do not believe that we should be characterizing Hitler as a nationalist. He was a homicidal, psychopathic maniac that killed his own people. A nationalist would not kill their own people.\u201d\nShe said that Lieu playing the clip was \u201cunbelievably dishonest,\u201d and that she was \u201cdeeply offended by the insinuation of revealing that clip without the question that was asked of me.\u201d\u00a0\nLieu and Owens\u2019 exchange received a lot of attention on Twitter, both positive and negative:", "date": "\n04/09/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ted-lieu-candace-owens-white-nationalism-hitler_n_5cacede9e4b0e833aa3210dc?64", "tags": "hearing hitler clip plays remarks owens white candace nationalism \u201d rep- made ted lieu"}
