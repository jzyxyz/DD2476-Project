{"title": "Doris Day: A Hip Sex Goddess Disguised as the Girl Next Door", "content": "The Hollywood Reporter obituary for Doris Day describes her in the headline as \u201cHollywood\u2019s Favorite Girl Next Door,\u201d which is reasonable enough, if not terribly imaginative. Day, who was 97 when she died on Monday, broke through as a singer in the mid-1940s and crossed over into movie stardom in the next decade. She\u2019s still often remembered as an avatar of the postwar, pre-counterculture pop culture mainstream: wholesome, friendly, sexless. Accordingly, the first adjective applied to her in that article\u2019s summary is \u201cvirginal.\u201d\nThat word evokes a leering one-liner attributed to the musician and wit Oscar Levant, who said he \u201cknew Doris Day before she was a virgin.\u201d Levant\u2019s joke depends on a category mistake, confusing the persona of a star with her person (Day was married four times), even as it misses the joke tucked into the persona itself. The v-word applied to Day signals the acceptance of an alibi that was never meant to be believed in the first place, the literal-minded gloss on a text that was only there to beckon us toward the subtext.\nThe truth, hidden in plain sight in so many of her movies and musical performances, is that Doris Day was a sex goddess. That\u2019s not a term we use much anymore (for good reason), and in its heyday it was generally applied to actresses who wielded their erotic energies more nakedly, so to speak.\n[Read our obituary of Doris Day. | Stream four great Day movies (and one TV show).]\nDay wasn\u2019t a glamorous blond enigma like Grace Kelly or Kim Novak \u2014 though she did, like both of them, work with Alfred Hitchcock. She was not a Hollywood bombshell in the manner of Marilyn Monroe (or Mamie Van Doren, with whom she competed for Clark Gable\u2019s attention in the 1958 comedy \u201cTeacher\u2019s Pet\u201d). And she certainly didn\u2019t work in the same erogenous zone as European actresses like Brigitte Bardot and Sophia Loren, who promised sophisticated American moviegoers a glimpse of freedom from Puritanical inhibition, and sometimes also from clothes.\nBut it\u2019s too easy to say that Day was simply the opposite \u2014 the prim, prudish, all-American avatar of Eisenhower-era repression, with her hair in a neat chignon and her figure sheathed in a soberly tailored suit. To see her that way is to take at face value an archetype that she did everything in her formidable power to subvert.\nReally, though, the whole virgin thing doesn\u2019t even rise to the level of archetype. It\u2019s an artifact of a movie censorship system that was, in the years after the Kinsey Report, rapidly losing touch with the realities of American behavior, and with the rest of popular culture as well.\nIn the canonical romantic comedies she made with Rock Hudson \u2014 \u201cPillow Talk\u201d and \u201cLover Come Back\u201d two years later \u2014 Day, in her late 30s, played unmarried New York career women.\nJan Morrow in \u201cPillow Talk\u201d is an interior designer with a thriving, if hectic, business. Her counterpart in \u201cLover Come Back,\u201d Carol Templeton, is a high-ranking executive in a Manhattan advertising firm. They are (implicitly) virgins by fiat of the production code, but really it\u2019s up to the audience to decide how credible it is that neither one has managed to sleep with anyone until Hudson shows up. (When Hudson and Day reunited for \u201cSend Me No Flowers\u201d in 1964, they were playing husband and wife, and it wasn\u2019t as much fun.)\nThe simple, sexist premise of these movies \u2014 and also of \u201cTeacher\u2019s Pet,\u201d in which Day\u2019s uptight professor is seduced by Gable, her most unlikely student \u2014 is that Day needs a raffish he-man to come along and ruffle her feathers with his sheer masculine irresistibility, getting her into bed with the benefit of clergy. But that pursuit is played out by means of a plot that relishes its own ridiculousness. The color schemes and production designs in the Hudson-Day comedies pulsate with whimsy. The atmosphere is pure camp, of the zany rather than the melodramatic variety. Every line sounds like a double-entendre. Every encounter is full of implication and innuendo, every character a collection of mixed signals.\nThese movies are naughty beyond imagining, and as clean as a whistle. In \u201cPillow Talk\u201d \u2014 in effect the first movie about the pleasures and consequences of phone sex \u2014 Hudson and Day take a bath together. It\u2019s a split-screen shot, but still.\nThe plot of \u201cLover Come Back\u201d turns on the mass marketing of a powerful, possibly hallucinogenic drug. Heterosexual courtship under the mandate of matrimony has rarely looked so kinky. We\u2019re not even talking about what it means that Rock Hudson is the male lead. The ambiguity is ambient. The deniability is perfect, and perfectly preposterous.\nDay is the key to it all, because her presence simultaneously upholds the pretense of virtuous normality and utterly transgresses it. She is a walking semiotic riot with a pert nose and a winning smile, keeper and scrambler of a whole book of social norms and cultural codes.\nTo see what I mean, consider a scene from \u201cPillow Talk\u201d in which Jan takes Brad Allen (Hudson\u2019s playboy classical-music composer) to a nightclub. It\u2019s maybe daring for his square sensibilities, which is to say that the music is being performed by black people. (The clientele is all white.) It turns out that his date is familiar with the musicians, and the music. Midway through a song called \u201cRoly Poly,\u201d the pianist and singer (Perry Blackwell) invites Jan to take a verse \u2014 \u201ccome on Miss Morrow, you know this one\u201d \u2014 and pretty soon Brad is clapping along. By the chorus, he and Jan are playing patty cake, and pretty soon the whole joint is singing about the satisfactions of a lover who is built for comfort rather than for speed.\nIt\u2019s impossible not to interpret this number as a cringe-inducing spectacle of cultural appropriation, pushed to and past the point of parody. The sexual and racial undercurrents eddy and swirl under a surface of pure silliness. In old Hollywood movies, African-American music is a complicated signifier, not least for the white characters who appreciate it. In not-so-old movies, too. When, for example, Ryan Gosling takes Emma Stone to listen to jazz in \u201cLa La Land,\u201d he is telling her, and us, something about the kind of guy he is. He\u2019s claiming access to, and a share of, what the music represents. Passion. Authenticity. Sex, too, of course.\nIn 1959, one name for this transaction \u2014 which might look from one angle like a gesture of respect, from another like an act of brazen existential plunder \u2014 was \u201chip.\u201d It was a noun as much as an adjective, and it was not a word that anyone would have thought to apply to Doris Day. Partly because she was too canny to take it seriously, notwithstanding her serious interest in African-American music.\nIn \u201cLove Me or Leave Me,\u201d a show-business biopic from 1955, she performs a version of Irving Berlin\u2019s \u201cShaking the Blues Away,\u201d wearing a low-cut bright-blue gown slit up to her thigh. The lyric\u2019s absurd evocation of religious revivals \u201cway down South\u201d gives way to a stageful of male chorines in top hats and tails, as Day belts out a paean to dancing that is a rollicking celebration of \u2026 something else. She\u2019s singing the language of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll at the moment of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll\u2019s emergence, but what she\u2019s doing is \u2026 something else. She\u2019s messing with all our categories. Which was her great and underappreciated gift.", "date": "May 14, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/movies/doris-day-appreciation.html", "tags": "next like disguised goddess come \u201d one sex girl hip doris hudson movies door day \u2014"}
