{"title": "Australian court approves A$70m payout for PNG detainees", "content": "A compensation payout of A$70m (\u00a343m; $56m) by the Australian government to asylum seekers detained in Papua New Guinea has been approved by a judge.\nCanberra offered the settlement in June after 1,905 men alleged they had suffered harm in detention on PNG's Manus Island. The government called the deal \"prudent\", but denied wrongdoing.\nAustralia sends asylum seekers arriving by boat to PNG and Nauru.\nThe deal is believed to be Australia's largest human rights settlement.\nThe Supreme Court of Victoria upheld the payout on Wednesday when Justice Cameron Macauley said he was satisfied that A$70m was an appropriate sum.\nMore than 1,300 of the now 1,923 people who are part of the class action have registered for the settlement. The class action represents the majority of asylum seekers and refugees detained on Manus Island since 2012.\nThe lawsuit alleged that detainees had been housed in inhumane conditions below Australian standards, given inadequate medical treatment and exposed to systemic abuse and violence.\nIt also claimed their detention was illegal, pointing to a decision by PNG's Supreme Court.\nIn June, the government said it \"strongly denied\" such claims. However, it elected to offer the settlement - and cover an estimated A$20m in costs - rather than proceed to a six-month trial. \nImmigration Minister Peter Dutton said it was an appropriate outcome because a trial would have cost \"tens of millions of dollars in legal fees alone, with an unknown outcome\". \nEarlier this week, the Australian court heard that some detainees believed the A$70m figure was not enough.\nOne current detainee, Amir Taghinia, told the Australian Broadcasting Corp that he had opted out of the settlement because it did nothing to help his situation.\n\"We are still suffering from the same conditions, under the cruel regime of the defendant, and the case is finished, the case says 'yeah, that's it, it is already settled,'\" he said.\nLaw firm Slater and Gordon, which brought the class action, has said the payout is largest human rights settlement in Australia's history.\nAustralia has insisted that no-one held on Manus or Nauru will ever be re-settled in Australia.\nIt says its tough offshore detention policy deters asylum seekers from attempting the life-threatening voyage to its shores in trafficking boats.\nHowever, the policy has frequently drawn controversy and deaths have occurred on Manus Island, including one last month.\nThe UN's refugee agency (UNHCR) has criticised Australia's offshore detention policy for causing \"extensive\" harm and breaching international law.\nAustralia will close the Manus Island detention centre by the end of October. \nAlthough some refugees may be resettled in the US, the fate of the 800 men still on the island remains unclear.", "date": "6 September 2017", "href": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-41169922", "tags": "australia payout island png court detainees asylum australian approves manus detention seekers settlement"}
