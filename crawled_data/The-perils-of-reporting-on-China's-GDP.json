{"title": "The perils of reporting on China's GDP", "content": "Whenever China's GDP figures are released, foreign correspondents fly into action with plenty of analysis about what they might mean.\nDoes the Chinese economy appear to be stronger or weaker than previously thought? \nWhere is steel production? \nWhat about the explosion in service industries?\nOf course there are the international implications: What do the numbers mean for other economies? \nWill Asia's powerhouse look to buy greater volumes Australian iron ore? \nCould a growing consumer sector mean more tourists heading to France or Vanuatu?\nThen we have to remind ourselves\u2026 hang on!\nPlenty of economists think that GDP is a massively flawed form of measuring the health of any economy but in this country it is even worse.\nThere is significant proportion of China watchers who don't believe the GDP figures are real at all.\nFor example, in 2016, the country's (year-on-year) GDP growth was exactly 6.7% for three quarters in a row.\nWhile this seems numerically unlikely, I suppose it is possible that this could happen.\nYet suspicion regarding growth statistics in the Middle Kingdom is not a new phenomenon.\nFor years, some provinces are thought to have been artificially inflating their numbers in order to create an appearance of improved economic performance on the part of their local leaders. \nOthers may have underestimated their growth so as to attract more favours from the national government.\nIn 2012, when you added the GDP of all provinces together this came to a greater number than the national total. \nNow, for the first time, we have official confirmation that GDP here has been fabricated.\nAccording to the Governor of Liaoning, Chen Qiufa, his province has been \"involved in a large-scale financial deception\" from 2011 to 2014. He said that fake data from city and county level officials misled the central government about the area's economy. \nHis announcement was made a meeting of the local legislature giving it even more gravitas.\nIf China's GDP is not to be trusted then how to judge this country's economic health?\nSome analysts turn to electricity consumption or seaborne cargo believing that these are actual measurable indicators of activity expanding or contracting.\nOther potential yardsticks could include building construction per square metre or domestic freight volumes.\nUsing these measures there are those who think that, in recent years, China's actual GDP growth should have dropped much more dramatically from 8% down to more like around 4% rather than just below 7%. \nHowever without solid, reliable figures this remains a debate with wide-ranging, conflicting views.\nMind you, even if at worse China's real GDP growth is around 4% at present, there are plenty of national governments which wouldn't mind a taste of those numbers.", "date": "20 January 2017", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-38686570", "tags": "country growth china gdp perils figures reporting numbers economy could plenty mean"}
