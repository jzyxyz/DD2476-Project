The Wall Street Journal won the national reporting award for disclosing clandestine payoffs made by the president\u2019s associates before the 2016 election to two women who had alleged affairs with Mr. Trump.\nThreats to journalists, foreign and domestic, provided a backdrop for this year\u2019s prizes, which also honored reporters forced to cover deadly tragedies in their hometowns and, in one case, their own newsroom.

Dana Canedy, the awards\u2019 administrator, cited The Capital Gazette\u2019s \u201cunflagging commitment to covering news at a time of unspeakable grief.\u201d\nIn honoring The Sun Sentinel, The Post-Gazette and The Capital Gazette, the Pulitzer board underlined the importance of local journalism at a moment when regional papers are struggling to survive. First given in 1917, the Pulitzer Prizes are presented annually by Columbia University for excellence in journalism and letters.\nInvoking the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, The Washington Post columnist killed in Turkey by Saudi assassins, Ms. Canedy praised this year\u2019s honorees for a willingness to speak truth to power.\n\u201cThis year\u2019s winning work reflects yet again a steely resolve in upholding the principles of this noble profession,\u201d Ms. Canedy said.\nThe Times\u2019s examination of Mr. Trump\u2019s family finances, by the journalists David Barstow, Susanne Craig and Russ Buettner, drew on tens of thousands of pages of confidential records and previously undisclosed tax returns.

Blight, won the history prize, and the biography award went to Jeffrey C. Stewart for \u201cThe New Negro: The Life of Alain Locke,\u201d a portrait of the Harlem Renaissance patron.\nDarrin Bell, a freelancer artist, became the first African-American to win for editorial cartooning, for a series published in The Washington Post on the experiences of disenfranchised groups under the Trump administration.\nIt was one of three prizes awarded on Monday to The Post, including feature photography \u2014 for Lorenzo Tugnoli\u2019s pictures of a famine in Yemen \u2014 and criticism, for essays by the paper\u2019s nonfiction book critic, Carlos Lozada.\nThe ProPublica journalist Hannah Dreier received the feature writing award, for capturing the plight of Salvadoran immigrants caught in a federal crackdown on MS-13 gang members on Long Island; one of her pieces was copublished by The New York Times Magazine.
