{"title": "New 'Game Of Thrones' Reveal Might Hint At Shocking Season 8 Returns", "content": "Information is coming.\nEarly Thursday morning, Entertainment Weekly announced its mammoth \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d story, a behind-the-scenes preview of Season 8 that would seemingly reveal more about the show than even the Three-Eyed Raven could know. And it did.\nTo start off, there\u2019s the first official photo of the season, featuring King in the North Kit Harington and Khaleesi Emilia Clarke in a what looks like an icy-and-fiery engagement shoot embrace:\nThen, there are the tearful cast reactions to the fact that 2019 marks the end of \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d Sophie Turner said she felt \u201cnumb\u201d after learning what would happen. Kit Harington apparently cried twice during the table read.\nFinally, there are the light spoilers.\u00a0We learn a bit about the giant battle with the Army of the Dead to come, which filmed for weeks and is \u201cexpected to be the most sustained action sequence ever made for television or film.\u201d\nAnd here\u2019s what we can expect from the Season 8 opener at the Stark home of Winterfell:\nIt\u2019s not entirely new information. Clips of the cast\u00a0bemoaning the end of \u201cGoT\u201d were already out there when EW released the story online (it\u2019ll be available in magazine form Friday), and we knew about the first Winterfell scenes from previous leaks.\nThe most enlightening bit in the EW story comes from an anecdote from reporter James Hibberd\u2019s trip to the set ahead of the Season 8 finale shoot, which is said to have included some unlikely characters:\nSnow my God. Who could these mysterious surprise characters be? A couple possibilities come to mind:\nHowland is the man to the left of young Ned Stark in the GIF above. He was the only other person besides Ned who survived the battle at the Tower of Joy, where Lyanna Stark gave birth to Jon Snow/Aegon Targaryen, aka the birthplace of the biggest secret on the show.\nWe haven\u2019t seen Howland on the show, other than in a Tower of Joy flashback/vision from Bran. But if he\u2019s showing up in the finale, it could have something to do with confirming Jon Snow\u2019s Targaryen heritage.\u00a0\nPlus, there\u2019s his daughter,\u00a0Meera Reed, still running around out there. In the books, it seems like she could be a love interest for Bran, so perhaps she\u2019ll return to the spotlight with her dad.\u00a0\nWhen Hibberd wrote that he was not expecting certain characters to appear in the finale, he might\u2019ve been hinting at something: we\u2019ve seen these characters before. And maybe he didn\u2019t expect them because they\u2019re supposedly dead.\nWe already know from casting director Nina Gold that Sean Bean was so important to the show that the northern accents we hear to this day are modeled after his voice. Even though Ned died in Season 1, he\u2019s constantly brought up in dialogue, including multiple times in Season 7. For example, between Sansa and Arya in the season finale:\nEarlier this year, I asked Bean about rumors of his possible return to the show, and at the time he told me, \u201cI\u2019ve heard rumors, but not from very good sources, that I might be back.\u00a0But I think I\u2019ve done my time there, and I created a good character.\u201d\nThe actor continued, telling me it\u2019d be \u201cstrange\u201d to see his character resurrected.\u00a0But this is the final season, so let\u2019s get strange.\nMaybe Ned will simply appear in a flashback. Or a vision. As a\u00a0Force ghost?\u00a0Who knows?\nThis is more wishful thinking, but we\u2019ve already predicted the return of dead Ned, so why stop there? Bring on all the dead people!\u00a0\nLady Stoneheart, a reanimated, zombified version of Catelyn Stark in the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, was famously cut from \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d a decision George R.R. Martin didn\u2019t necessarily agree with. It\u2019d be extremely weird if the show brought her back in the Season 8 finale, but better late than never. Are we Reed-ing too far into this or could these returns warm our icy stonehearts?
