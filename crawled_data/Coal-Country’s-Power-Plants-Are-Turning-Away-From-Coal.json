{"title": "Coal Country\u2019s Power Plants Are Turning Away From Coal", "content": "Coal is on the defensive in the nation\u2019s power industry. Even in coal country.\nThe pressure to shift more of the country\u2019s electric supply to renewable sources is not just a rallying cry for environmentalists. Some of the power industry\u2019s biggest customers, like General Motors and Microsoft, have made a commitment to clean energy. And to help them meet it \u2014 and keep them from taking their business elsewhere \u2014 utilities are changing their ways.\nWest Virginia, where coal is king, is no exception.\nAppalachian Power, the leading utility there, is quickly shifting toward natural gas and renewable sources like wind and solar, even as President Trump calls for a coal renaissance. Appalachian Power still burns plenty of coal, but in recent years it has closed three coal-fired plants and converted two others to gas, reducing its dependence on coal to 61 percent last year, down from 74 percent in 2012.\nChris Beam, the company\u2019s president, made the industry\u2019s shifting dynamics clear in an encounter with Gov. Jim Justice, a Democrat, at his inaugural ball in January.\n\u201c\u2018Look, I\u2019d like to see you guys build another coal plant,\u2019\u201d he recalled the governor saying. \u201cAnd our answer was: We\u2019re not going to build another coal plant.\u201d (The governor confirmed the account, but added in an email, \u201cI\u2019ll continue to encourage power companies to burn more coal to put our miners back to work.\u201d)\nIt\u2019s the same story in Virginia, where Dominion, a leading utility based in Richmond \u2014 near where commercial coal mining got its start \u2014 designed a special rate to make it easier for Amazon Web Services and similar customers to buy renewable energy.\nIn Kentucky, a chance meeting between a state regulator and a Facebook employee ultimately led the Public Service Commission to advise utilities that they could offer customers renewable energy packages, part of an effort to attract new business and hold on to automakers like G.M. and Toyota.\nAnd in Wyoming, the nation\u2019s leading coal producer by far, Black Hills Energy worked with Microsoft to create a complex arrangement for the technology giant to get enough wind energy to fulfill current and future needs at Microsoft\u2019s data center in Cheyenne.\n\u201cI\u2019ve not spoken to a single utility that\u2019s truly holding on to a future of more coal,\u201d said Brian Janous, who directs energy strategy at Microsoft. \u201cThey\u2019re looking to attract, as in the Appalachian case, new customers, and those customers aren\u2019t attracted by coal.\u201d\nAlmost half of the Fortune 500 companies have adopted at least one climate or clean-energy goal, with 23 of them pledging eventually to run their businesses on 100 percent renewable energy, including Walmart, Bank of America and Google, according to a recent report by the World Wildlife Fund and other environmentally minded organizations and investors.\nThough corporations are buying renewable energy across the country, energy executives and analysts say it is notable that the trend is taking hold in states where coal production is part of the economic heart and soul.\nCoal executives say that they are watching the impact of the renewable-power demands on the coal industry, but that it is a matter of rising unease.\n\u201cWe\u2019re concerned about it,\u201d said Harry Childress, president of the Virginia Coal and Energy Alliance. \u201cWe see the pressure from these companies is pushing power producers more away from coal, which is a cheaper power.\u201d\nFive years ago, corporate renewable-energy partnerships with utilities were barely a blip on the electric industry radar. But they are rapidly increasing, according to a recent report by the World Resources Institute, which has helped to promote them.\nLast year, utilities made deals with corporate customers through rate arrangements known as green tariffs for 220 megawatts of power, enough to run about 40,000 average American homes. Thus far this year, there have been 360 megawatts worth of agreements, with an additional 465 megawatts under negotiation.\n\u201cThis is what these corporations want and, for the electric companies, they have to figure out how to do it,\u201d said Lisa Wood, executive director of the Institute for Electric Innovation at the Edison Foundation, a nonprofit arm of the utility industry. \u201cThis is a tremendous driver. These are very, very large customers.\u201d\nOne reason for the rapid acceleration is that utilities and regulators \u2014 often with technical assistance from environmental groups \u2014 are learning how to devise rates and transaction structures to accommodate the energy purchases.\nAppalachian Power\u2019s switch from coal was in part pushed as a result of a summit meeting that its parent company, American Electric Power, held at its headquarters last fall with corporate giants including Walmart, Facebook, Hilton, Procter & Gamble and Marathon Petroleum.\nThose companies stressed that if they were going to expand their businesses in A.E.P. regions, they would need access to low-carbon energy. American Electric Power organized a second meeting in Washington in May that included Amazon, Caesars Entertainment, DuPont, Marriott International and Starbucks.\nWith the goal of attracting big business to coal country, Mr. Beam is now in the market to buy, lease or build a fleet of wind and solar power farms across West Virginia and Virginia. The goal is to increase Appalachian Power\u2019s renewable-energy fleet to 34 percent of its power capacity by 2031 from 17 percent today.\nAn announcement for a new wind farm in southern West Virginia is expected within weeks, as discussions with big companies \u2014 which American Electric Power executives refused to identify \u2014 continue.\n\u201cSpecific customers are looking specifically for renewables and to what degree you are moving toward a new clean energy economy,\u201d said Nicholas K. Akins, A.E.P.\u2019s chief executive. \u201cShareholders are more interested in sustainability going forward and improvements from a climate change perspective and carbon emissions perspective.\u201d\nMr. Akins said American Electric Power, which serves over five million customers in 11 states, intended to respond to the demands of customers whatever policies were dictated in Washington. He added, \u201cWe are trying to make our company long-term sustainable regardless of administration.\u201d", "date": "May 26, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/26/business/energy-environment/coal-power-renewable-energy.html", "tags": "plants country renewable electric energy turning \u201d customers industry away coal \u2014 power"}
