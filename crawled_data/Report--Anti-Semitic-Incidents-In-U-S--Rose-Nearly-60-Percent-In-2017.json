{"title": "Report- Anti-Semitic Incidents In U-S- Rose Nearly 60 Percent In 2017", "content": "The number of anti-Semitic incidents in the United States rose nearly 60 percent in 2017,\u00a0according to a new report from the Anti-Defamation League, marking the largest single year increase the organization has ever recorded.\u00a0\nAccording to the report, published Tuesday, the ADL counted 1,986 anti-Semitic incidents in 2017,\u00a0a 57 percent increase over the year before.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s also the second highest tally the ADL has recorded since 1979, when the organization, which tracks anti-Semitism and other forms of hate, started conducting its annual count. Only 1994 saw more, with 2,066 anti-Semitic incidents.\u00a0\n\u201cA confluence of events in 2017 led to a surge in attacks on our community \u2013 from bomb threats, cemetery desecrations, white supremacists marching in Charlottesville, and children harassing children at school,\u201d said ADL CEO Jonathan A. Greenblatt in a statement. \u201cThese incidents came at a time when we saw a rising climate of incivility, the emboldening of hate groups and widening divisions in society.\u201d\nThe report breaks down anti-Semitic incidents into three categories: There were 1,015 incidents of harassment last year, a 41 percent increase over the prior year; 952 incidents of vandalism,\u00a0an 86 percent increase; and 19 incidents of assault,\u00a0a 47 percent decrease.\u00a0\nThe most common place for these acts of hate was in schools. There were 457 anti-Semitic incidents at K-12 schools in America last year, a 94 percent increase from the 235 recorded at schools in 2016.\u00a0\n\u201cThe consistent increase of anti-Semitic incidents against students of all ages is deeply troubling,\u201d Greenblatt said. \u201cWe know that students do not always report when they are being bullied, so for every incident that\u2019s reported, it is likely there\u2019s another that goes unreported.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nAnother ADL report released last month detailed 204 incidents of anti-Semitism on college campuses in 2017, a nearly\u00a090 percent increase\u00a0over the year before.\u00a0\nThe most anti-Semitic incidents last year occurred in the first three months of 2017, as the country reeled from a particularly contentious presidential election. January, February and March saw 208, 273 and 273 incidents respectively.\nThere were 163 bomb threats made against Jewish institutions during those three months. A 19-year-old Israeli-American named Michael Ron David Kadar was arrested in Israel for making the bulk of those threats.\u00a0It later emerged that Kadar, whom his mother described as autistic and suffering from a brain tumor, sold his bomb threat services on the dark web.\u00a0\n\u201cOur goal in the Audit is not to count anti-Semites, but rather to document cases where Jews were targeted for assault, vandalism and harassment,\u201d an ADL spokesman explained to HuffPost.\u00a0\n\u201cRegardless of the motivation of any specific perpetrator, Jewish communities were repeatedly traumatized by these assaults on their institutions and threats to their safety. The bomb threats sowed fear and anxiety among Jews across the country.\u201d\u00a0\nThe report similarly states that the desecration of seven Jewish cemeteries in 2017 \u2014 most of which occurred at the beginning of the year \u2014 \u201ccontributed to a sense that the Jewish American community was under siege.\u201d\u00a0\nThe ADL\u2019s report adds to a growing body of evidence pointing to a rise in hate in America.\u00a0A recent report, also from the ADL,\u00a0found that\u00a0white supremacists in the U.S.\u00a0killed more than twice as many people in 2017 as they did the year before, helping make 2017 the fifth deadliest year on record for extremist violence in America. (Already in 2018, a neo-Nazi allegedly murdered a gay Jewish college student in California.)\u00a0\u00a0\nHate crimes rose about 5 percent in 2016, according to the latest FBI tally,\u00a0marking the first time in over 10 years that the country has experienced consecutive annual increases in hate crimes.\nPreliminary hate crime statistics for 2017 \u2014 collected by Brian Levin, a professor at the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino \u2014 showed a 20 percent rise in hate crimes in 13 large American cities.\u00a0\nEarlier this month, the Southern Poverty Law Center released its annual \u201cYear in Hate and Extremism\u201d\u00a0report, identifying 954\u00a0hate groups\u00a0in the U.S. \u2013 an increase of 4 percent from 2016. The SPLC attributed this rise in hate groups, and a similar increase in 2016, to the rhetoric of\u00a0President Donald Trump.\n\u201cPresident Trump in 2017 reflected what white supremacist groups want to see: a country where racism is sanctioned by the highest office, immigrants are given the boot and Muslims banned,\u201d said Heidi Beirich,\u00a0director of the SPLC\u2019s Intelligence Project.\u00a0\nTo the delight of racists and fascists across the country, Trump has on numerous occasions given political cover or tacit support to white nationalism. During the campaign, he was slow to disavow the support of David Duke, a former KKK grand wizard and avowed anti-Semite.\u00a0The president also tweeted an image of Hillary Clinton standing next to an apparent Star of David and a pile of cash. (This anti-Semitic meme originated on an alt-right message board on 8chan.)\u00a0\nOnce in office, Trump issued a Holocaust Remembrance Day\u00a0statement\u00a0that omitted any mention of anti-Semitism or Jews.\u00a0He refused to condemn his supporters for making anti-Semitic threats against journalist Julia Ioffe. \u201cI know nothing about it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to talk to them about that.\u201d (Andrew Anglin, the anti-Semite behind the neo-Nazi site The Daily Stormer, told HuffPost that he interpreted Trump\u2019s lack of condemnation as \u201can endorsement\u201d for the threats against Ioffe.)\u00a0\nAnd after the violent white supremacist gathering in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August \u2014 which ended with a neo-Nazi allegedly driving his car into a crowd of counter-protesters, injuring 19 people and killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer \u2014 Trump said there were \u201cvery fine people\u201d on both sides of the rally.\u00a0\nAmerica does not do a good job of tracking incidents of hate and bias. We need your help to create a database of such incidents across the country, so we all know what\u2019s going on.\u00a0Tell us your story.", "date": "\n02/27/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/anti-semitic-incidents-united-states-2017_n_5a956390e4b0699553cc77cb", "tags": "anti-semitic percent hate report report- u-s- nearly \u201d adl incidents year rose increase"}
