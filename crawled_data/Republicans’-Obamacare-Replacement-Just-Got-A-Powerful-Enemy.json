{"title": "Republicans\u2019 Obamacare Replacement Just Got A Powerful Enemy", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2015 Provisions in the House Republicans\u2019 Obamacare replacement bill\u00a0that would raise insurance costs for older Americans are drawing resistance from the influential seniors\u2019 lobby.\nThe American Health Care Act, as Republicans are calling it, would allow insurers to make premiums for older Americans five times what they charge younger workers \u2015 provided that a state\u2019s regulations allow for it. Obamacare had capped this ratio, known as an \u201cage rating,\u201d at 3 to 1.\nThe measure was chief among the reasons AARP, the nation\u2019s largest organization for older Americans,\u00a0cited in explaining its opposition to the House bill on Tuesday evening.\n\u201cOlder Americans need affordable health care services and prescriptions,\u201d\u00a0AARP Executive Vice President Nancy LeaMond said in a statement. \u201cThis plan goes in the opposite direction, increasing insurance premiums for older Americans and not doing anything to lower drug costs.\u201d\nAARP, which has nearly 38 million members ages 50 and older, is also firmly opposed to a pair of major changes to Medicaid that the House bill includes. One is a rollback of Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion, which made the program available to millions of low-income adults, many of them seniors, who had no insurance before. The other is a new Medicaid funding formula that could leave states on the hook for more and more money, a report from the left-leaning\u00a0Center on Budget and Policy Priorities concluded Tuesday. That might force states to make cuts that hurt seniors, many of whom rely on Medicaid for nursing home care and other health services.\n\u201cMedicaid cuts could impact people of all ages and put at risk the health and safety of 17.4 million children and adults with disabilities and seniors by eliminating much needed services that allow individuals to live independently in their homes and communities,\u201d LeaMond said. \u201cThis harmful legislation would make health care less secure and less affordable.\u201d\u00a0\nAARP used its considerable political power to help pass Obamacare in 2010, despite the opposition of many members \u2015 about 400,000 left the organization in protest. AARP\u2019s objection to key elements of the Republican bill to replace the landmark law could prove just as influential.\n\u201c[AARP] backed it and paid the price for backing it, so why not support it against repeal?\u201d said Fred Lynch, a professor at Claremont McKenna College and author of \u201cOne Nation Under AARP.\u201d \u201cThe Congress is genuinely afraid of age power, and they\u2019d just as soon let the sleeping giant go on sleeping.\u201d\n\u201cThe only possible leader right now is AARP, so it\u2019s sort of in their hands,\u201d he said.\nThe mammoth organization has already registered its opposition to the two measures in letters to Congress in late January and early February.\nAARP premiered a new video advertisement for the campaign on Monday, suggesting it was ramping up its efforts to kill the provision.\u00a0\nIn the tongue-in-cheek ad that runs for just over a minute, a man chopping wood alongside a squirrel named Charlie expresses his anger at the \u201cage tax.\u201d\n\u201cYou know, Charlie and I were watching the news this morning, and they said that Congress has just introduced a new age-rating bill,\u201d the wood-chopping narrator says. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018What the heck is age rating?\u2019 Then Charlie explained that it\u2019s Washington politician-speak for overcharging older Americans for their health insurance while lining the insurance companies\u2019 pockets.\u201d\nThe ad is part of an\u00a0advocacy campaign AARP launched Feb. 15 to specifically combat a rise in the \u201cage rating,\u201d which it is calling an \u201cage tax.\u201d At the time, the organization encouraged its members to call those in Congress who were active in drafting the health care legislation to oppose the rating provision.\nAARP\u2019s concern about how the Republican bill would affect Americans 50 and older is well-founded, according to two health care experts.\n\u201cAcross the board, what it does is shift costs from younger people to older people,\u201d said Timothy Jost, a leading health reform expert and emeritus professor at the Washington and Lee University School of Law.\nRepublicans introduced the proposal with the goal of enticing younger Americans to buy health insurance and rebalance insurance risk pools, according to Jost.\nThe bill would also create a tax credit to buy insurance that increases based on age.\u00a0But the tax credits are, at most, twice as large for older Americans while the premiums could be five times higher.\n\u201cIt is sending seniors a 2-foot rope to get themselves out of a 10-foot hole,\u201d said Sabrina Corlette, a professor at Georgetown University\u2019s Health Policy Institute.\nCorlette predicted that under the Republican plan, many Americans in their 50s and early 60s would be unable to pay for private insurance and would end up going without coverage. That risks driving up medical debt, which could lead to more bankruptcies.\nSome might delay retirement to keep employer-sponsored insurance, Corlette suggested.\n\u201cIf there is less coverage as people get older, people ... are less likely to leave a job to care for a family member or pursue their own business,\u201d she added.\nMany of the older Americans hardest hit by these changes live in rural, Republican-leaning areas, according to an\u00a0interactive analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation. Under the House plan, 60-year-olds earning $30,000 a year would see their tax credits drop 75 percent or more in most of Arizona and large swaths of western Nebraska. The least affected states include solidly Democratic Washington, Vermont, New York and Massachusetts.\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t run this by the politicians. They didn\u2019t look at it seriously in terms of its effect on Republican voters and [Donald] Trump voters,\u201d said Jost, who is also a contributing editor at Health Affairs.\nAARP represents an older demographic that leans Republican and tended to vote for Trump in November.\u00a0\nRepublican senators spent much of their time Tuesday dodging questions about the specifics of the House Republican bill, saying they needed more time to read it. \u00a0\nAsked about the language in the bill that would allow insurers to charge their oldest customers five times what they charge younger ones, Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) said he\u2019s fine with it. \n\u201cFive-to-one\u2019s been a standard part of the process and what it was several years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cNo, five-to-one doesn\u2019t concern me at all.\u201d\u00a0\nSen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) said he\u2019s still studying the bill and that there\u2019s \u201ca lot I\u2019m not wild about,\u201d but the increase in premiums for older Americans wasn\u2019t one of them.\n\u201cThe current price controls are clearly not working,\u201d he said. \u201cGetting away from price controls would probably improve the viability of the individual market.\u201d\nPressed on the fact that it could mean older workers will have to postpone their retirement if the Republican bill passes, Toomey said, \u201cI will leave it at that.\u201d\nUnlike her colleagues, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) expressed concern about the change.\u00a0\n\u201cWell it depends on how you structure the credit because, in fact, seniors are more expensive, but if you offset that by giving them a greater credit you can make sure that they\u2019re not hurt by the reality that seniors use more health care,\u201d she said.\nBut Collins acknowledged that preliminary analyses of the credits afforded under the bill to older customers suggest they won\u2019t keep pace with the higher premiums.\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s an issue that I have. I need more information about the credits and also about the fact that it looks like the credits are the same amount whether you make the bottom of pay scale, or income scale, or the top.\u201d", "date": "\n03/07/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/republican-obamacare-replacement-aarp_n_58bf4cf9e4b0ed71826809f0", "tags": "obamacare health enemy \u201d got replacement republicans older bill americans insurance aarp powerful"}
