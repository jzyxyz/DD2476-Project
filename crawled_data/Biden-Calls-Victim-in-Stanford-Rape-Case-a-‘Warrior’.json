{"title": "Biden Calls Victim in Stanford Rape Case a \u2018Warrior\u2019", "content": "The furor surrounding a Stanford rape case extended to the nation\u2019s capital on Thursday: A congresswoman read an excerpt from the victim\u2019s statement on the House floor, a congressman called for the judge to be removed, and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. wrote an open letter to the victim, calling her \u201ca warrior \u2014 with a solid steel spine.\u201d\nIn his letter, obtained by BuzzFeed, Mr. Biden expressed his \u201cfurious anger\u201d over the sexual assault \u2014 for which a former Stanford student, Brock Turner, 20, was convicted in March \u2014 and his disappointment in a culture that \u201ccontinues to ask the wrong questions\u201d of victims.\n\u201cI do not know your name \u2014 but your words are forever seared on my soul, words that should be required reading for men and women of all ages,\u201d he wrote, referring to the powerful statement the 23-year-old woman read in court during a sentencing hearing in Santa Clara County Superior Court last week.\nThe case  spurred national outrage  when Mr. Turner, a former Stanford swimmer, received a six-month sentence and three years probation by Judge Aaron Persky after being convicted of three felony counts of sexual assault for his attack on an intoxicated and unconscious woman behind a Dumpster.\nCritics of the judge\u2019s sentencing have begun an effort to recall him, even as others have defended his decisions, and threats of violence have flooded the California court\u2019s phone lines.\nRepresentative Jackie Speier, a Democrat from California, speaking from the House floor on Thursday, called the six-month sentence a \u201ctravesty\u201d and said that she was working on \u201cseveral pieces of legislation\u201d to aid the survivors of sexual assault and harassment.\n\u201cOur justice system must become better than this,\u201d she said. \u201cOur educational system must become better than this.\u201d\nShe then read an excerpt from the victim\u2019s 7,244-word statement, saying that \u201cher bravery inspires me as I hope it will inspire you.\u201d\nThe victim\u2019s statement, published by BuzzFeed on June 3, was also read on the air by a CNN anchor on Monday. Chirlane McCray, the wife of Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, along with a group of celebrities and government officials, read it aloud on Wednesday in a video that was posted to Facebook.\nRepresentative Ted Poe, a Republican from Texas who also read an excerpt from the statement on the House floor, said that Judge Persky should be removed from the bench.\n\u201cVictims like this remarkable woman must know that society and the justice system are on their side,\u201d Mr. Poe said Thursday.\nIn other developments:\n\u2022 Two of the women who had written character statements on behalf of Mr. Turner apologized Wednesday for supporting him. Leslie Rasmussen, the drummer for the band Good English, which had several of its shows canceled after news of her support became public, posted her apology on Facebook.\n\u201cI did not acknowledge strongly enough the severity of Brock\u2019s crime and the suffering and pain that his victim endured, and for that lack of acknowledgment, I am deeply sorry,\u201d she wrote.\n\u2022 In her speech, Ms. Speier noted that Mr. Turner will most likely serve half of his sentence.\nOnline records show that Mr. Turner, who was booked on June 2, is expected to be released from the Santa Clara County jail on Sept. 2.\nIt is not uncommon for county jail inmates to serve 50 percent of their sentences if they keep a clean disciplinary record. Calls to the county Department of Corrections weren\u2019t immediately returned Thursday.", "date": "June 9, 2016", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/10/us/biden-calls-victim-in-stanford-rape-case-a-warrior.html", "tags": "victim biden rape stanford calls \u2018 warrior thursday judge read \u201d turner statement case \u2014"}
