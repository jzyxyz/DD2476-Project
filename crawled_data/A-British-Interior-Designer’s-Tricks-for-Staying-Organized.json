{"title": "A British Interior Designer\u2019s Tricks for Staying Organized", "content": "\u201cKeeping things tidy makes me very happy,\u201d says the interior designer Beata Heuman, seated in her homey, open-plan office in West London. The bright, vaulted space has served as the studio and showroom for her five-person team since last summer \u2014 and is a testament to the Swedish decorator\u2019s desire to both beautify and meticulously organize her world. Heavy antique trays are neatly set with swatches of fabric, wallpaper samples and trims are lined up for clients; deep cabinet drawers are filled with files pertaining to each of the room schemes that currently fall under her careful watch. Altogether, it\u2019s a visual itinerary of thousands of bespoke objects and furnishings. Flanked by banks of windows to the north and south, the only interruption to the prevailing sense of order and calm is the somnolent hum of passing tube trains.\n\u201cPeople tend to think that interior design is just choosing the right cushions,\u201d says Heuman from her desk, where a ceramic lamp with a marbleized shade sits beside a well-thumbed Fabriano Artist\u2019s Journal and a resin sample created for a client during the nine years she worked with the British decorator Nicky Haslam. \u201cBut it\u2019s as much about logistics as it is about creativity. I love admin. It gives me a real sense of achievement to pull everything together in an efficient way.\u201d Heuman\u2019s forensic eye for detail, offbeat palettes and playful irreverence \u2014 perhaps best exhibited at the Farm Girl Cafes in Chelsea and Notting Hill, as well as a growing stream of international homes \u2014 has seen her become one of England\u2019s most beloved young designers since launching her business in 2013.\n[Coming later this spring: the T List newsletter, a weekly roundup of what T Magazine editors are noticing and coveting.

On a circular dining table in the center of the space, copies of books by Steven Gambrel and David Hicks \u2014 decorators who have long inspired her \u2014 are stacked around a terra-cotta pot planted with katsura flowers. It\u2019s here that Heuman often sits to paint watercolor renderings of her whimsical schemes and creations. Once general practice in the world of interiors, she uses this charmingly old-fashioned brush-to-paper approach to better communicate ideas to clients. In fact, it perfectly chimes with her peculiarly English aesthetic: With a keen sense of the past, Heuman effortlessly blends periods and styles to create harmonious, vibrant spaces that are just maximalist enough.\nIn the office, there are Matisse cutouts and haunting prints by the photographer Robin Friend alongside Dodo Egg lights and lion-footed velvet armchairs of Heuman\u2019s own design (part of her elegant but offbeat collection of furniture, fabrics and lighting), which cleverly elevate the bank of Ikea desks that inhabit one side of the space. But no matter how eccentric Heuman\u2019s vision, it\u2019s always offset by a certain crisp orderliness. \u201cI wanted to create a fun environment that\u2019s an uplifting place to work,\u201d she says. \u201cWe spend so much time here, it\u2019s important for everyone\u2019s happiness.\u201d Here, she offers advice on how to keep interiors fresh \u2014 and stem the constant tide of clutter.\nWhen Heuman shifted her business\u2019s headquarters from the basement of her Hammersmith home to the nearby Ravenscourt Park, the first thing she did was invest in a labeling machine. \u201cThe reality is that this is a very creative office, and we\u2019re working on things and pulling samples out all the time, so it might not always be super tidy or in perfect order, but you know where everything is,\u201d she says. Now, fabric swatches that were once stacked up in boxes are housed inside an antique haberdashery cabinet, whose generous glass drawers are labeled by pattern and finish \u2014 from velvet to mohair to printed cotton and linens. \u201cI got a bit obsessive with it,\u201d she admits. \u201cI took it home and started labeling everything from my decanted shampoo bottles to jars of grains and polenta flour to my children\u2019s clothing drawers. At times, my husband thinks I have gone too far.\u201d Not only is it tidier, but in a shared space, it\u2019s the perfect way to communicate where things should be stored.\n\u201cNowadays, there aren\u2019t many professions that involve much filing, so I look to the past for storage,\u201d Heuman says of the pair of tall, cast-iron lockers in dark green that flank the haberdashery cabinet. Their top shelves are often reached using a teak step that handily folds out into a table. \u201cWith interiors, there are so many swatches and samples, and so much stuff that I get to really indulge my habit,\u201d she smiles. Heuman takes a twofold approach to storage solutions, mixing modern Ikea desks and furnishings in cream, white or navy with utilitarian pieces from the architectural reclamation experts at Retrouvius that bring personality to the space.\nHeuman\u2019s mantra is to streamline, streamline, streamline. The only way to stem the tide of detritus, she says, is to have constant clear outs. She instigates fortnightly office \u201cstreamlining sessions,\u201d continually sorting through her own papers and questioning her team about the buildup of boxes or packages. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how much stuff you accumulate,\u201d she says. \u201cStaying on top of it all is hard work. But I can concentrate so much better when there\u2019s no paperwork to do and the space is clear.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s always important to make sure everything has its place, but that\u2019s especially true when a space is decoratively more maximalist,\u201d says Heuman. \u201cIt gets all too heavy otherwise.\u201d When designing for clients, Heuman begins with the furniture layout, forensically thinking through the natural home for everything from mops to tea towels to baby bottles. In her view, inspiring her clients to tidiness is the key to a scheme\u2019s lasting success. \u201cOur aesthetic is colorful and layered, but it always has a cleanness to it,\u201d she says.\nHeuman applies Marie Kondo\u2019s rule of thumb when deciding what to display and what to conceal in the home. \u201cI try to hide as much as possible, as a space can get clogged up with stuff so quickly,\u201d she says. \u201cBut if an object sparks joy, then have it on show.\u201d In the kitchen of her home, Heuman pours dishwashing soap into pretty glass bottles for display and dry goods into glass jars, which she stores in her cupboard. When designing kitchens from scratch, she\u2019ll often include glass fronted cupboards so that ceramic and glassware, or even attractively packaged food stuffs, can be shown off.\n\u201cPeople often forget about using the full height of a room,\u201d she says. She stashes suitcases and other items that aren\u2019t needed regularly on top of high cupboards. In her office, stock from her burgeoning line of products is stowed on elevated alcove shelving, which she reaches using her antique step ladder. If you\u2019re investing in joinery, build cupboards right up to the ceiling (as well as in the dead spaces such as under the stairs). This has the added advantage of bringing a sense of height to the room. Buy beds with drawers or removable mattresses for storing linens, towels or suitcases.\nHeuman also recommends regular wardrobe purges. \u201cI clear out my clothes three or more times a year,\u201d she says. \u201cI really enjoy doing it. When it\u2019s not so crammed you can actually see what you have.\u201d She\u2019ll systematically stash out-of-season clothes in boxes at the top of her closet. Her advice is to simply ask yourself whether you really use or need each item. If you\u2019re unsure, and have an attic, stow it awhile to see whether or not you miss it. This process of constantly sorting has the added advantage of inspiring new outfits such as the buttoned-up, gray vintage dress that she\u2019d bought some five years ago and now pleasingly teams with a white shirt and Charlotte Olympia trainers. Once the purge is complete, though, it\u2019s essential to stay on top of things: \u201cThe more you clear out, the better you get at keeping it tidy because you know what it means to start again from scratch,\u201d she says. \u201cIt only takes a few seconds to put things away neatly.\u201d\nIt\u2019s never too early to get organized. At home, even Heuman\u2019s 2-year-old gets involved in cleaning up. \u201cWe do it together,\u201d she says. They divide her daughter\u2019s toys into baskets according to category. \u201cShe\u2019s already able to understand the concept of organizing. Even for her it feels good to have some order. It\u2019s healthy for the brain to compartmentalize things and to get into the tidying habit early.\u201d\nRather than storing shoes in boxes, Heuman has a deep drawer in the wardrobe of her bedroom at home where pairs are stacked one on top of the other in V-shaped racks. \u201cIt doubles the storage and means you can easily see what shoes you have,\u201d says the designer, who also invests in shoe trees for special pairs \u2014 part of a wider effort to buy less, but better, then make things last. \u201cIf you look after them, they\u2019ll last forever.\u201d Beyond the confines of her footwear drawer, there\u2019s a strict one-in, one-out policy. \u201cIf I have more than a single pair of shoes by the front door, my husband takes them upstairs in a rage,\u201d she says. \u201cIt sounds a bit nuts, but if he wasn\u2019t like that maybe things would spiral a bit more. Tidying is a never-ending process, but to us, for now at least, it\u2019s worth it.\u201d", "date": "March 25, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/25/t-magazine/beata-heuman.html", "tags": "designer interior tricks organized things much home space \u201d heuman british says top \u2014 staying"}
