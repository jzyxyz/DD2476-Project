Over Inquiry Into Possible Aid to Russia", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump on Saturday unleashed an extended assault on the F.B.I. and the special counsel\u2019s investigation, knitting together a comprehensive alternative story in which he had been framed by disgraced \u201closers\u201d at the bureau\u2019s highest levels.\nIn a two-hour span starting at 7 a.m., the president made a series of false claims on Twitter about his adversaries and the events surrounding the inquiry. He was responding to a report in The New York Times that, after he fired James B. Comey as F.B.I. director in 2017, the bureau began investigating whether the president had acted on behalf of Russia.\nIn his tweets, the president accused Hillary Clinton, without evidence, of breaking the law by lying to the F.B.I. He claimed that Mr. Comey was corrupt and best friends with the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. He said Mr. Mueller was employing a team of Democrats \u2014 another misleading assertion \u2014 bent on taking him down.\nIndividually, the president\u2019s claims were familiar. But as the special counsel\u2019s inquiry edges ever closer to him, Democrats vow a blizzard of investigations of their own and the government shutdown reaches record lengths, Mr. Trump compiled all the threads of the conspiracy theory he has pushed for many months in an effort to discredit the investigation.\nHours later, Mr. Trump continued his broadside on a friendly television venue, Jeanine Pirro\u2019s show on Fox News. Asked \u201care you now or have you ever worked for Russia, Mr. President?\u201d Mr. Trump did not directly answer the question.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the most insulting thing I\u2019ve ever been asked,\u201d he said by telephone. \u201cI think it\u2019s the most insulting article I\u2019ve ever had written.\u201d\nHe also denied a report in The Washington Post that he had taken extensive steps to conceal from other high-ranking officials his conversations with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia over the past two years.\nRepresentative Eliot L. Engel, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said that his panel would hold hearings on \u201cthe mysteries swirling around Trump\u2019s bizarre relationship with Putin and his cronies, and how those dark dealings affect our national security.\u201d\nIn his Twitter outburst earlier in the day, Mr. Trump accused the F.B.I. of opening \u201cfor no reason\u201d and \u201cwith no proof\u201d an investigation in 2017 into whether he had been working against American interests on behalf of Russia, painting his own actions toward Russia as actually \u201cFAR tougher\u201d than those of his predecessors.\nThe Times article, published Friday evening, reported that law enforcement officials became so alarmed by Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior surrounding his firing of Mr. Comey that they took the explosive step of opening a counterintelligence investigation against him.\nNaming several of the bureau\u2019s now-departed top officials, including Mr. Comey and his deputy, Andrew G. McCabe, Mr. Trump said the F.B.I. had \u201ctried to do a number on your President,\u201d accusing the \u201closers\u201d of essentially fabricating a case. \u201cPart of the Witch Hunt,\u201d he wrote \u2014 referring dismissively to the investigation now being overseen by Mr. Mueller.\nAt the time he was fired in May 2017, Mr. Comey had been leading the F.B.I.\u2019s investigation into Russia\u2019s attempts to influence the 2016 presidential election, and the officials believed that his removal, in hindering the inquiry, posed a possible threat to national security. Their decision to open the case was informed, in part, by two instances in which Mr. Trump tied the firing to the Russia investigation.\nThe inquiry they opened had two aspects, including both the newly disclosed counterintelligence element and a criminal element that has long been publicly known: whether the firing constituted obstruction of justice.\nWhen Mr. Mueller was appointed days later, he took over the joint inquiry as part of his larger investigation of Russia\u2019s action in 2016 and whether anyone on the Trump campaign conspired with Moscow. It is not clear whether he is still pursuing the counterintelligence matter, and no public evidence has emerged that Mr. Trump himself secretly conspired with the Russian government or took directions from it.\nMr. Trump indicated on Saturday that he had not known of the existence of the counterintelligence investigation before the Times article, and he did not dispute the newspaper\u2019s reporting.\nBut he made clear that he viewed any such inquiry as illegitimate from the start. He presented it, without evidence, as part of a vast, yearslong conspiracy to undo his presidency.\nIn the tweets, Mr. Trump defended his decision to fire Mr. Comey \u2014 \u201ca total sleaze!\u201d \u2014 at length, accusing the former director of overseeing a \u201crigged & botched\u201d investigation of Mrs. Clinton, and leading the agency into \u201ccomplete turmoil.\u201d Democrats and Republicans alike wanted Mr. Comey removed, he said.\n\u201cMy firing of James Comey was a great day for America,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote. \u201cHe was a Crooked Cop.\u201d\nBut an investigation conducted by the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general and internal surveys of F.B.I. agents have undercut Mr. Trump\u2019s portrayal of Mr. Comey as corrupt and unpopular within the bureau.\nMr. Trump\u2019s comments echoed those that his White House spokeswoman, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, released on Friday night.\n\u201cThis is absurd. James Comey was fired because he\u2019s a disgraced partisan hack, and his deputy, Andrew McCabe, who was in charge at the time, is a known liar fired by the F.B.I.,\u201d Ms. Sanders said. \u201cUnlike President Obama, who let Russia and other foreign adversaries push America around, President Trump has actually been tough on Russia.\u201d\nParts of the statements by Mr. Trump and Ms. Sanders are at odds with the public record and with the findings of the inspector general\u2019s report. While Democrats were furious with Mr. Comey over his public statements about the Clinton email server case \u2014 at a news conference and in a pair of letters in the middle of the campaign \u2014 they were deeply alarmed by his removal, given his role in the Russia investigation.\nIn his report, the inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, pointedly criticized Mr. Comey for breaking with longstanding policy to publicly discuss the Clinton case, and he castigated \u201cinsubordinate\u201d senior officials who worked with Mr. Comey for privately criticizing Mr. Trump even as they investigated him. But he ultimately said he had found no evidence to believe that the decisions not to charge Mrs. Clinton for her use of a private email server in handling classified information \u201cwere affected by bias or other improper considerations.\u201d\n\u201cRather, we concluded that they were based on the prosecutor\u2019s assessment of facts, the law and past department practice,\u201d he wrote.\nMr. McCabe, who briefly served as acting director after Mr. Comey was removed, was fired last March for failing to be forthcoming with investigators about an unrelated conversation he had authorized between F.B.I. officials and a journalist. Mr. McCabe argued that the firing was politically motivated and designed to hinder the Russia investigation. Other members of Mr. Comey\u2019s team have also been fired or left the bureau.\nMr. Comey responded on Twitter on Saturday with a quotation attributed to former President Franklin D. Roosevelt: \u201cI ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made.\u201d\nThe Times report cited former law enforcement officials and others familiar with the investigation, as well as private testimony that the F.B.I.\u2019s former general counsel, James A. Baker, delivered to Congress related to the inquiry.\n\u201cNot only would it be an issue of obstructing an investigation, but the obstruction itself would hurt our ability to figure out what the Russians had done, and that is what would be the threat to national security,\u201d Mr. Baker said in his testimony, portions of which were read to The New York Times.\nSome former law enforcement officials outside the case have since debated whether F.B.I. investigators overreacted in opening the counterintelligence inquiry during a chaotic period after Mr. Comey\u2019s firing. Other former officials noted that those critics were not privy to all of the evidence and argued that sitting on it would have been an abdication of duty.", "date": "Jan. 12, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/12/us/politics/trump-fbi-counterintelligence-investigation.html", "tags": "possible f.b.i officials \u201c inquiry comey investigation aid lengthy trump russia attack \u2014 tweets"}
