{"title": "In These Lying Times, \u2018Receipts\u2019 Offer a Glimmer of Justice", "content": "Keeping up with the truth has become a miserable business. All the old political stagecraft and prevaricating, the Rumsfeldian tautologies \u2014 we\u2019re way past that. Forget smoke and mirrors. These are pants-on-fire times. According to The Washington Post\u2019s \u201cFact Checker,\u201d President Trump made 836 false or misleading claims in his first six months as president. This summer, The New York Times\u2019s opinion section paired a list of Trump\u2019s statements with contradicting sources from PolitiFact, FactCheck.org, The Washington Post and The Toronto Star. But that kind of reporting doesn\u2019t seem to burn Trump. He\u2019s flame-retardant.\nThe president\u2019s lying, and his seeming imperviousness to the facts even after being caught, have incited a general zeal for truth-seeking in other realms of power. Lies \u2014 from white ones to whoppers \u2014 are being exposed almost as fast as they are being told, via Freedom of Information Act request, via news reports, via the fire extinguisher we\u2019re now calling \u201creceipts.\u201d\nTrump didn\u2019t beget receipts. They\u2019ve migrated from social media and pop culture and are being used to confront the powerful. When judicial and legislative avenues seem stalled or faulty, receipts work as currency in the people\u2019s court. And sometimes they command actual consequences.\nIn early October, investigations in The Times and The New Yorker exposed claims of decades of sexual harassment, assault and rape by the movie executive Harvey Weinstein, and his attempts to cover them up with bullying and money. A few days after the initial report, Weinstein made denials but also sent a private note to fellow Hollywood executives beseeching them to persuade the board of his company not to fire him. It was a plea that managed to self-incriminate. (A line like \u201cA lot of the allegations are false as you know\u201d feels like an admission of something.) One executive read the note to Janice Min, the former editorial director of The Hollywood Reporter. She tweeted a screen shot of the transcription as digital evidence. In other words, she tweeted a receipt.\nA receipt used to refer to something material \u2014 physical proof of a transaction that was usually financial. Anyone who has ever filed an expense report can attest to how easy they are to lose. Phone technology has simplified our relationship to the receipt as a material thing. Uploading scraps of paper to an app, say, helps maintain blood pressure and sanity. That same technology has nudged receipts into the realm of metaphysics. They\u2019re as much conceptual now as they are illegible wads in the Bermuda Triangle of a purse or a pair of jeans, kept by your accountant but by the cosmos too. Receipts are a confirmation of the truth, a corroboration of hypocrisy. And they\u2019re fast \u2014 faster than that FOIA request, faster than a special-counsel investigation. Receipts are comeuppance by way of the H.O.V. lane.\nThree days after the Weinstein story broke in The Times, Donald Trump Jr. dug up a 2015 tweet by the documentary filmmaker Michael Moore that called Weinstein \u201cone of the best people to work with in this town\u201d and tweeted, \u201cThis didn\u2019t age well.\u201d In response, a torrent of receipts flooded Trump Jr.\u2019s post, including a cover of The New York Daily News that mocked his father for bragging about groping women and a party photo of Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner smiling happily with Weinstein. Those receipts told the pot it was calling the wrong kettle black.\nReceipts as a stand-in for legal and legislative or even personal justice have a robust and varied life in popular culture, where they\u2019re evidence admissible in the court of beef. Just about the best laugh anybody has given me all year comes halfway through Katy Perry\u2019s song \u201cSwish Swish.\u201d It\u2019s a nominal dis track delivered with the whimsical illogic of certain nursery rhymes. At the end of the second verse, Perry lifts her pettiness to a spiritual plane. \u201cYou\u2019re \u2019bout as cute as/An old coupon expired/And karma\u2019s not a liar.\u201d That\u2019s not the funny part. That\u2019s just Perry doing her stabbing with a spork. The funny part is how she knows karma tells the truth: \u201cShe keeps receipts.\u201d\n\u201cSwish Swish\u201d was aimed, apparently, at Katy Perry\u2019s foe Taylor Swift, who claimed last year that Kanye West lied that she\u2019d signed off on his song \u201cFamous,\u201d in which he boasts \u201cI made that bitch famous.\u201d Her public display of outrage lasted a few months. Then West\u2019s wife, Kim Kardashian, posted to Snapchat a video of West talking with Swift on the phone about the song that contradicted Swift\u2019s claim, inspiring GQ\u2019s Jake Woolf to note, in an article on the scandalette: \u201cShe does, in fact, have the damn receipts.\u201d\nThe stakes for the receipts era might seem tastelessly low. But receipts can also implicate more broadly. During the denouement of the \u201cFamous\u201d affair, Slate\u2019s Katy Waldman wrote, \u201cThe receipt boom registers a shift in our society: Where the powerful once exercised their power with relative impunity, now we might be seeing glimmers of accountability.\u201d Well, almost no one who has been presented with receipts has copped to being culpable. So if we are not yet seeing actual accountability, then at the very least there is shame, and for the receipt holder, righteousness.\nOr just glimmers of reason. \u201cReceipts\u201d enjoy a robust social-media life as a visual contradiction of anyone from pop stars to our president. The side-by-side comparisons tweeted in January, by the National Park Service, of the crowds at Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 swearing-in and Donald Trump\u2019s this year refuted President Trump\u2019s claim that his were bigger. The Park Service\u2019s tweet was deleted from its account, but its image lived on elsewhere as a kind of ghost receipt for whenever Trump and some of his staff bragged about historic inauguration attendance. In September, after the president deleted some tweets praising Luther Strange, the incumbent Senate candidate from Alabama who went on to lose the special-election primary runoff, speculation ensued about whether it was illegal for Trump to expunge those tweets. The news organization ProPublica archives them all, but the act of erasing any would seem to make such tweets even more valid as receipts.\nReceipts represent a kind of extralegal self-sufficiency. You may not need an attorney general if you can take a screen shot. \u201cReceipts\u201d can even act as a kind of racial relief, as a lightening of the burden of proof. There\u2019s a long history of white Americans needing no proof to accuse black Americans of having committed a crime, while blacks could never seem to find enough. \u201cReceipts\u201d may not be capable of delivering judicial justice. But they\u2019re certainly useful for exposing all manner of injustice, like an eyewitness video of an unarmed black man\u2019s being shot and killed by the police that is shared with the world because it contradicts the officer\u2019s version of events.\nThe author Ta-Nehisi Coates has spoken about history being the ultimate kind of receipt in that it confirms centuries of claims of racial injustice. In a conversation earlier this month at the New School in New York, he discussed his experience with Clyde Ross, the moral anchor of Coates\u2019s 2014 essay, \u201cThe Case for Reparations,\u201d and how critical certain kinds of proof are to changing the way you see the world. Ross\u2019s accounts of discrimination were evidence of a legacy of American racism. \u201cClyde Ross,\u201d Coates said, \u201cgave me the receipts.\u201d\nThis modern cast of \u201creceipt\u201d hails from a tragic source, the same well that also gave us such infectious expressions of trouble as \u201cHell to the no\u201d and \u201cCrack is whack.\u201d It hails from Whitney Houston. In 2002, before the release of a new album (\u201cJust Whitney\u201d), Houston sat down for an interview with Diane Sawyer, who voiced concern about Houston\u2019s rumored drug use. She mentions a news item claiming a $730,000 drug habit. Houston is incredulous. \u201cCome on,\u201d she says, with more aggrieved Chicagoan in her voice than you\u2019d expect from a Jersey girl. \u201c730? I wish.\u201d Then she lets out a hoarse, sputtering laugh: \u201cI wish whoever\u2019s making that kind of money off of me could share it with me.\u201d Then she stops laughing. \u201cNo way. I want to see the receipts,\u201d she says before a pause and some agitation. \u201cFrom the drug dealer I bought $730,000 worth of drugs from: I want to see the receipts.\u201d Her pique was a quietly comic performance of umbrage \u2014 one she couldn\u2019t sustain. Shortly after, she confesses to Sawyer. It\u2019s gutting.\nHouston is talking about her life, but it has always felt to me as if she\u2019s really talking about the way the music business warped and misused her. Of course she was on drugs. But the people around her looked the other way, while demanding more of her, sober or not. With Sawyer, Houston was cool, but watching the conversation now, you can sense a more desperate anger. Showbiz cannibals and a greedy celebrity press were chewing her up. A decade before the overdose that killed her, Houston was talking about America, the way its power has devoured black people and women \u2014 sometimes for money, sometimes for sport, sometimes for nothing. She was the receipt.\nThe holders of such power tend to be men, who have evaded accountability, let alone atonement, who have, over and over, proved impervious to receipts. But it means something that we\u2019re even talking about \u201creceipts\u201d as an emblem of an era. It means we bought something that isn\u2019t working. And we\u2019re determined to keep pointing out how defective it is.", "date": "Oct. 24, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/magazine/in-these-lying-times-receipts-offer-a-glimmer-of-justice.html", "tags": "\u2018 way glimmer lying justice times \u201d offer receipts receipt new \u2014 houston"}
