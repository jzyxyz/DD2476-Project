{"title": "Brexit Deal Has the Backing of E.U. Leaders. What Happens Now?", "content": "LONDON \u2014 Now comes the harder part.\nOn Sunday, the 27 other members of the European Union gave the green light to Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s deal to seal Britain\u2019s divorce from the bloc.\nBut she still has huge hurdles to overcome.\n\u2022 Mrs. May will take the pact to the British Parliament: The prime minister must win the support of lawmakers who agree with rivals like Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, who had given her Brexit plan scathing reviews, and some members of the opposition Labour Party, which has promised to vote against the deal.\n\u2022 Lawmakers  will vote: A vote is expected before Christmas. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said on Sunday that \u201cthe arithmetic\u201d to get the votes was looking \u201cchallenging.\u201d Mrs. May took her case to the people, writing an open letter to the nation in which she argued that the deal was \u201cone that works for our whole country and all of our people, whether you voted \u2018Leave\u2019 or \u2018Remain.\u2019\u201d\n\u2022 Transition would follow approval. Both the House of Commons and the European Parliament must sign off on the deal. If that happens, Britain would be on course to leave the bloc on March 29, with a transition period until December 2020.\n\u2022 The British Parliament rejects the deal? The Labour Party, the Democratic Unionist Party of Northern Ireland and some hard-line Brexit supporters in Mrs. May\u2019s Conservative Party have vowed to vote against the deal. A rejection could put Mrs. May\u2019s leadership, and perhaps her government, in peril.\n\u201cPolitically, the U.K. is in as deep a crisis as it has ever known since 1945,\u201d Kevin Featherstone, the head of the European Institute at the London School of Economics, said by email on Sunday. \u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be a clear majority in Parliament for any alternative to the deal: not for \u2018no deal\u2019 and leaving just with the W.T.O. rules; not for a referendum again; not for \u2018Remain.\u2019\u201d\n\u2022 If Parliament votes no, a 21-day deadline kicks in. Mrs. May will have 21 days to make a statement on how the government is to proceed.\n\u2022 Mrs. May could try to renegotiate. European Union leaders made it clear on Sunday that she was unlikely to win any significant concessions in a second round, so this tactic is unlikely to break the deadlock.\n\u2022 The prime minister could resign. Nothing in her record suggests she would quit easily, especially if no one has a better plan.\n\u2022 She could face a leadership challenge. Political chaos could make Mrs. May\u2019s position seem untenable. But rebels have so far failed to secure the 48 Conservative votes needed to call a no-confidence vote, let alone the 159 votes to oust Mrs. May.\n\u2022 Lawmakers could try to assemble a cross-parties majority for a \u201csofter\u201d Brexit.  Some would like Britain to stay in Europe\u2019s single market, at least temporarily. It would mean accepting the free movement of people, which Brexit campaigners fought hard to end.\n\u2022 A second referendum could occur.  Britons could be given the chance to change their minds and stay in the European Union \u2014 but such a vote would have to be passed through Parliament and could take months to set up.\n\u2022  \u201cNo deal\u201d Brexit could become a reality:  If Parliament is gridlocked, leaving the European Union without a deal is the default option. But with Brexit day looming, the fear of what would happen to supply chains, trade and transportation could change perceptions.\nMr. Featherstone suggested that, if the only alternative is no deal at all, lawmakers who don\u2019t like Mrs. May\u2019s deal may \u201cin the end vote for it for fear of there being no other solution.\u201d", "date": "Nov. 25, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/25/world/europe/uk-brexit-eu.html", "tags": "brexit may leaders could happens \u2022 parliament \u201d e.u vote backing mrs. deal"}
