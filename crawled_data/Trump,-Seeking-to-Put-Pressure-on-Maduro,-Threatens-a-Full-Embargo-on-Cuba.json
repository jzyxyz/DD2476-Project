{"title": "Trump, Seeking to Put Pressure on Maduro, Threatens a Full Embargo on Cuba", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump on Tuesday accused Cuba of aiding the government of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of Venezuela, who the administration evidently hoped would be ousted by day\u2019s end, warning that the United States would impose an embargo and additional sanctions on the country if Cuba did not end its support.\n\u201cIf Cuban Troops and Militia do not immediately CEASE military and other operations for the purpose of causing death and destruction to the Constitution of Venezuela,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, \u201ca full and complete embargo, together with highest-level sanctions, will be placed on the island of Cuba.\u201d\nAt the same time, the Trump administration reaffirmed its demand for the immediate installation of Juan Guaid\u00f3, the opposition leader, as Mr. Maduro\u2019s successor.\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said in an interview with CNN that Mr. Maduro had planned to flee to Cuba on Tuesday morning, but was urged by the Russian government to stay. \u201cHe was headed to Havana,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said, without elaborating on how the administration knew about Mr. Maduro\u2019s destination or his communications with the Kremlin.\nAsked what his message to Mr. Maduro was, Mr. Pompeo was blunt: \u201cFire up the plane.\u201d\nIn a televised address on Tuesday, Mr. Maduro appeared with top military and civilian leaders and denied Mr. Pompeo\u2019s assertion.\n\u201cPlease,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not being serious.\u201d\nThe statements by the president and Mr. Pompeo reflected the administration\u2019s frustration that the pressure on Mr. Maduro did not reach the turning point that some in the Trump administration expected it would. Mr. Guaid\u00f3 traveled to a military base in Venezuela and called for a public uprising, urging the country\u2019s military to join his effort, but by the end of the day that had not happened.\nIn a meeting with reporters in the White House driveway, John R. Bolton, the president\u2019s national security adviser, called out three senior Venezuelan officials who he said could play a critical role in turning the tide against Mr. Maduro. He named the defense minister, Vladimir Padrino L\u00f3pez, as well as the chief judge of the Supreme Court, and the commander of the presidential guard, all of whom Mr. Bolton said have expressed support for the opposition in the past.\nMr. Bolton said that the administration believed the Cubans \u201chave played a very significant role in propping Maduro up today.\u201d\nPresident Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel of Cuba, who is an ally of Mr. Maduro\u2019s, responded that the effort to topple the Maduro government was a \u201ccoup movement that aims to fill the country with violence.\u201d\nTrump administration officials have long believed that Cuba has played a role in arming and training Venezuelan police officers and forming gangs that have clashed with protesters, and have repeatedly warned the Cuban government and imposed sanctions against it. But experts say Cuba is not capable of propping up the Maduro government to the same degree as Russia, which has unloaded military planes in Caracas, the Venezuelan capital.\nRobin Derby, a professor of Latin American history in California, said in an interview that the administration\u2019s fixation on Cuba was misguided.\n\u201cThis is a trumped up, Cold War set of charges that make no sense at all,\u201d Ms. Derby said. \u201cCuba has no resources to provide Venezuela, and I think you could make a stronger case that Venezuela has been propping up the Cuban regime\u201d with medical supplies and subsidized oil, she said.\nMs. Derby added that the pressure the administration was putting on Venezuela had Cubans worried about their own economy further collapsing.", "date": "April 30, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/30/us/politics/trump-maduro-cuba.html", "tags": "put administration embargo full maduro threatens venezuela \u201d trump cuba pressure seeking"}
