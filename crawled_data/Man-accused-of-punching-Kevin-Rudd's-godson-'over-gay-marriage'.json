Australia is currently debating legalising same-sex marriage. \nPolice said a man had been charged with assault and public nuisance offences.\nMr Rudd claimed Sean had been attacked at a bus stop \"for objecting when a man began ripping down rainbow banners and hurling verbal abuse\".\nPolice said the alleged attack happened in Brisbane on Tuesday and a 48-year-old man will face a court hearing next month.\nAustralians began casting votes this week in a non-binding postal survey on whether to legalise same-sex marriage.\nThe survey has been criticised by many same-sex marriage supporters for potentially exposing LGBT Australians to vilification. They say parliament alone should debate changing the law.\nOn Wednesday, Australia passed legislation aimed at preventing hate speech during the survey, which ends in November.", "date": "15 September 2017", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-41275691", "tags": "rudd godson accused man same-sex punching kevin marriage survey police charged gay"}
