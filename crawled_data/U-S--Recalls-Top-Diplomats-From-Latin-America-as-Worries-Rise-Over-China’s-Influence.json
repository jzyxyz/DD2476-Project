{"title": "U.S. Recalls Top Diplomats From Latin America as Worries Rise Over China\u2019s Influence", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The United States has recalled three chiefs of mission from Latin American nations that cut diplomatic ties with Taiwan in favor of recognizing China.\nThe move comes as American officials have expressed growing unease over China\u2019s rising influence in the region.\nThe diplomats, who represent the United States in the Dominican Republic, El Salvador and Panama, will meet with leaders in Washington \u201cto discuss ways in which the United States can support strong, independent, democratic institutions throughout Central America and the Caribbean,\u201d a spokeswoman for the State Department, Heather Nauert, said in a written statement on Friday.\nFor decades, Taiwan and China have competed for recognition. In 1979, the United States switched its support and officially established sovereign relations with China, and many other countries followed. But Washington has supported any decisions by nations to continue recognizing Taiwan, a self-governing island that China wants to bring under Communist Party rule.\nIn recent years, China has had success in courting Taiwan\u2019s diplomatic partners. Only 17 nations recognize Taiwan; outside the Vatican and Swaziland, they are all islands in the Pacific and the Caribbean or countries in Latin America.\nAmerican officials have expressed growing concern over the shift. The United States sells arms to Taiwan and maintains a diplomatic presence there, called the American Institute in Taiwan, now housed in a new $250 million compound. American officials see Taiwan\u2019s de facto independence as an important hedge against Chinese dominance in the Asia-Pacific region \u2014 what the United States now calls the Indo-Pacific as it tries to strengthen ties with South Asian nations to balance against China.\nLast month, El Salvador severed ties with Taiwan, prompting the White House to accuse China of \u201capparent interference\u201d in El Salvador\u2019s domestic politics. American officials fear that the four nations in Central America that still recognize Taiwan \u2014 Belize, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua \u2014 could soon follow. Last May, Burkina Faso switched recognition to China, leaving Swaziland as the lone holdout in Africa.\nIn June 2017, Panama cut ties with Taiwan, which surprised the United States government. The American ambassador to Panama at the time, John Feeley, said he learned about the switch from the president, Juan Carlos Varela, only an hour or so before Mr. Varela announced it, and only because he had called Mr. Varela to discuss an unrelated matter.\nMr. Feeley, who left his post in March and is now a consultant for Univision, said in an interview on Saturday that the recall of top American diplomats was significant.\nThe diplomats returning to Washington are Robin Bernstein, ambassador to the Dominican Republic; Jean Manes, ambassador to El Salvador; and Roxanne Cabral, the charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires in Panama. A State Department official said they would return to their posts by Sept. 14.\nThe move \u201cis an appropriate and serious signal by the U.S. government to those three countries and to the Chinese government that it is now reviewing the implications of the diplomatic switch and is worried that U.S. interests could be jeopardized,\u201d Mr. Feeley said.\n\u201cMy sense is that they will be most focused on the issue of industrial and commercial espionage and the possibility of Beijing using its embassies to expand that activity in those countries and the Caribbean Basin,\u201d he added.\nChina is now the world\u2019s second-largest economy and is expected to overtake the United States as the largest one in 10 to 15 years.\nIt is difficult for any nation, especially a small one, to decide not to recognize the sovereignty of China.\nChina and Taiwan have long engaged in what some observers call \u201ccheckbook diplomacy\u201d to woo countries by offering aid or other incentives. China\u2019s financial packages have increased in recent years, especially as it has promoted infrastructure projects abroad and related loans and contracts as part of what it calls its Belt and Road Initiative.\nJorge Guajardo, a former Mexican ambassador to China, said on Saturday that the recall was \u201cheavy handed.\u201d The United States should not be surprised as Latin American governments push back against American requests, he added, when President Trump has continued to alienate the people of Latin America.\n\u201cTrump has openly and systematically offended Latin American countries and their people,\u201d Mr. Guajardo wrote in an email. \u201cHe labels us as rapists and criminals, has never traveled to the region as president, has deported and separated families, and threatened to cut all sort of aid. China comes with an offer of friendship and economic development (albeit one that I don\u2019t think will pan out). Why the surprise?\u201d\nThe United States has yet to fill some ambassador posts in the region, including those in Mexico and Panama, Mr. Guajardo noted, whereas China has assigned ambassadors in all Latin American nations with which it has diplomatic relations.\n\u201cSave a few countries in Latin America, the region as a whole has a historical preference for the U.S. as the main ally,\u201d he said. \u201cThis changed when Trump assumed the presidency. It was his call, his choice, to turn away from the region.\u201d\nChina has grown more strident over the issue of Taiwan since Tsai Ing-wen, a strong critic of Beijing, became president of Taiwan in May 2016. Chinese officials have worked to erase any recognition by corporations of Taiwan\u2019s sovereignty. For example, they successfully pressured international airlines this summer, including those in the United States, to list just \u201cTaipei,\u201d a city designation, in their booking systems rather than phrases that included \u201cTaiwan,\u201d as was the case for decades.\nLast month, Ms. Tsai made state visits to Belize and Paraguay to try to strengthen ties with those nations.", "date": "Sept. 8, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/08/us/politics/us-latin-america-china.html", "tags": "latin american america china diplomats taiwan u.s. united states worries \u201d nations recalls influence rise top"}
