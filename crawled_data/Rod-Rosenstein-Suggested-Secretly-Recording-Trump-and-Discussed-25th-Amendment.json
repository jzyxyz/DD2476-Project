{"title": "Rod Rosenstein Suggested Secretly Recording Trump and Discussed 25th Amendment", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, suggested last year that he secretly record President Trump in the White House to expose the chaos consuming the administration, and he discussed recruiting cabinet members to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Mr. Trump from office for being unfit.\nMr. Rosenstein made these suggestions in the spring of 2017 when Mr. Trump\u2019s firing of James B. Comey as F.B.I. director plunged the White House into turmoil. Over the ensuing days, the president divulged classified intelligence to Russians in the Oval Office, and revelations emerged that Mr. Trump had asked Mr. Comey to pledge loyalty and end an investigation into a senior aide.\nMr. Rosenstein was just two weeks into his job. He had begun overseeing the Russia investigation and played a key role in the president\u2019s dismissal of Mr. Comey by writing a memo critical of his handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation. But Mr. Rosenstein was caught off guard when Mr. Trump cited the memo in the firing, and he began telling people that he  feared he had been used.\nMr. Rosenstein made the remarks about secretly recording Mr. Trump and about the 25th Amendment in meetings and conversations with other Justice Department and F.B.I. officials. Several people described the episodes in interviews over the past several months, insisting on anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. The people were briefed either on the events themselves or on memos written by F.B.I. officials, including Andrew G. McCabe, then the acting bureau director, that documented Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s actions and comments.\nNone of Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s proposals apparently came to fruition. It is not clear how determined he was about seeing them through, though he did tell Mr. McCabe that he might be able to persuade Attorney General Jeff Sessions and John F. Kelly, then the secretary of homeland security and now the White House chief of staff, to mount an effort to invoke the 25th Amendment.\nThe extreme suggestions show Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s state of mind in the disorienting days that followed Mr. Comey\u2019s dismissal. Sitting in on Mr. Trump\u2019s interviews with prospective F.B.I. directors and facing attacks for his own role in Mr. Comey\u2019s firing, Mr. Rosenstein had an up-close view of the tumult. Mr. Rosenstein appeared conflicted, regretful and emotional, according to people who spoke with him at the time.\nMr. Rosenstein disputed this account.\n\u201cThe New York Times\u2019s story is inaccurate and factually incorrect,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cI will not further comment on a story based on anonymous sources who are obviously biased against the department and are advancing their own personal agenda. But let me be clear about this: Based on my personal dealings with the president, there is no basis to invoke the 25th Amendment.\u201d\nA Justice Department spokeswoman also provided a statement from a person who was present when Mr. Rosenstein proposed wearing a wire. The person, who would not be named, acknowledged the remark but said Mr. Rosenstein made it sarcastically.\nBut according to the others who described his comments, Mr. Rosenstein not only confirmed that he was serious about the idea but also followed up by suggesting that other F.B.I. officials who were interviewing to be the bureau\u2019s director could also secretly record Mr. Trump.\nMr. McCabe, who was later fired from the F.B.I., declined to comment. His memos have been turned over to the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, in the investigation into whether Trump associates conspired with Russia\u2019s election interference, according to a lawyer for Mr. McCabe. \u201cA set of those memos remained at the F.B.I. at the time of his departure in late January 2018,\u201d the lawyer, Michael R. Bromwich, said of his client. \u201cHe has no knowledge of how any member of the media obtained those memos.\u201d\nThe revelations about Mr. Rosenstein come as Mr. Trump has unleashed another round of attacks in recent days on federal law enforcement, saying in an interview with the newspaper The Hill that he hopes his assaults on the F.B.I. turn out to be \u201cone of my crowning achievements,\u201d and that he only wished he had terminated Mr. Comey sooner.\n\u201cIf I did one mistake with Comey, I should have fired him before I got here. I should have fired him the day I won the primaries,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI should have fired him right after the convention. Say, \u2018I don\u2019t want that guy.\u2019 Or at least fired him the first day on the job.\u201d\nDays after ascending to the role of the nation\u2019s No. 2 law enforcement officer, Mr. Rosenstein was thrust into a crisis.\nOn a brisk May day, Mr. Rosenstein and his boss, Mr. Sessions, who had recused himself from the Russia investigation because of his role as a prominent Trump campaign supporter, joined Mr. Trump in the Oval Office. The president informed them of his plan to oust Mr. Comey. To the surprise of White House aides who were trying to talk the president out of it, Mr. Rosenstein embraced the idea, even offering to write the memo about the Clinton email inquiry. He turned it in shortly after.\nA day later, Mr. Trump announced the firing, and White House aides released Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s memo, labeling it the basis for Mr. Comey\u2019s dismissal. Democrats sharply criticized Mr. Rosenstein, accusing him of helping to create a cover story for the president to rationalize the termination.\n\u201cYou wrote a memo you knew would be used to perpetuate a lie,\u201d Senator Christopher Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, wrote on Twitter. \"You own this debacle.\u201d\nThe president\u2019s reliance on his memo caught Mr. Rosenstein by surprise, and he became angry at Mr. Trump, according to people who spoke to Mr. Rosenstein at the time. He grew concerned that his reputation had suffered harm.\nA determined Mr. Rosenstein began telling associates that he would ultimately be \u201cvindicated\u201d for his role in the matter. One week after the firing, Mr. Rosenstein met with Mr. McCabe and at least four other senior Justice Department officials, in part to explain his role in the situation.\nDuring their discussion, Mr. Rosenstein expressed frustration at how Mr. Trump had conducted the search for a new F.B.I. director, saying the president was failing to take the candidate interviews seriously. A handful of politicians and law enforcement officials, including Mr. McCabe, were under consideration.\nTo Mr. Rosenstein, the hiring process was emblematic of broader dysfunction stemming from the White House. He said both the process and the administration itself were in disarray, according to two people familiar with the discussion.\nMr. Rosenstein then raised the idea of wearing a recording device, or \u201cwire,\u201d as he put it, to secretly tape the president when he visited the White House. One participant asked whether Mr. Rosenstein was serious, and he replied animatedly that he was.\nIf not him, then Mr. McCabe or other F.B.I. officials interviewing with Mr. Trump for the job could perhaps wear a wire or otherwise record the president, Mr. Rosenstein offered. White House officials never checked his phone when he arrived for meetings there, Mr. Rosenstein added, implying it would be easy to secretly record Mr. Trump.\nMr. Rosenstein mentioned the possibility of wearing a wire on at least one other occasion, the people said, though they did not provide details.\nThe suggestion itself was remarkable. While informants or undercover agents regularly use concealed listening devices to surreptitiously gather evidence for federal investigators, they are typically targeting drug kingpins and Mafia bosses in criminal investigations, not a president viewed as ineffectively conducting his duties.\nIn the end, the idea went nowhere, the officials said. But they called Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s comments an example of how erratically he was behaving while he was taking part in the interviews for a replacement F.B.I. director, considering the appointment of a special counsel and otherwise running the day-to-day operations of the more than 100,000 people at the Justice Department.\nAt least two meetings took place on May 16 involving both Mr. McCabe and Mr. Rosenstein, the people familiar with the events of the day said. Mr. Rosenstein brought up the 25th Amendment during the first meeting of Justice Department officials, they said. A memo about the second meeting written by one participant, Lisa Page, a lawyer who worked for Mr. McCabe at the time, did not mention the topic.\nMr. Rosenstein\u2019s suggestion about the 25th Amendment was similarly a sensitive topic. The amendment allows for the vice president and a majority of cabinet officials to declare the president is \u201cunable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.\u201d\nMerely conducting a straw poll, even if Mr. Kelly and Mr. Sessions were on board, would be risky if another administration official were to tell the president, who could fire everyone involved to end the effort.\nMr. McCabe told other F.B.I. officials of his conversation with Mr. Rosenstein. None of the people interviewed said that they knew of him ever consulting Mr. Kelly or Mr. Sessions.\nThe episode is the first known instance of a named senior administration official weighing the 25th Amendment. Unidentified others have been said to discuss it, including an unnamed senior administration official who wrote an Op-Ed for The New York Times. That person\u2019s identity is unknown to journalists in the Times news department.\nSome of the details in Mr. McCabe\u2019s memos suggested that Mr. Rosenstein had regrets about the firing of Mr. Comey. During a May 12 meeting with Mr. McCabe, Mr. Rosenstein was upset and emotional, Mr. McCabe wrote, and said that he wished Mr. Comey were still at the F.B.I. so he could bounce ideas off him.\nMr. Rosenstein also asked F.B.I. officials on May 14, five days after Mr. Comey\u2019s firing, about calling him for advice about a special counsel. The officials responded that such a call was a bad idea because Mr. Comey was no longer in the government. And they were surprised, believing that the idea contradicted Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s stated reason for backing Mr. Comey\u2019s dismissal \u2014 that he had shown bad judgment in the Clinton email inquiry.\nMr. Rosenstein, 53, is a lifelong public servant. After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard Law School, he clerked for a federal judge before joining the Justice Department in 1990 and was appointed United States attorney for Maryland.\nMr. Rosenstein also considered appointing as special counsel James M. Cole, himself a former deputy attorney general, three of the people said. Mr. Cole would have made an even richer target for Mr. Trump\u2019s ire than has Mr. Mueller, a lifelong Republican: Mr. Cole served four years as the No. 2 in the Justice Department during the Obama administration and worked as a private lawyer representing one of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s longtime confidants, Sidney Blumenthal.\nMr. Cole and Mr. Rosenstein have known each other for years. Mr. Cole, who declined to comment, was Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s supervisor early in his Justice Department career when he was prosecuting public corruption cases.\nMr. Trump and his allies have repeatedly attacked Mr. Rosenstein and have also targeted Mr. McCabe, who was fired in March for failing to be forthcoming when he was interviewed in an inspector general investigation around the time of Mr. Comey\u2019s dismissal. The inspector general later referred the matter to federal prosecutors in Washington.\nThe president\u2019s allies have seized on Mr. McCabe\u2019s lack of candor to paint a damning picture of the F.B.I. under Mr. Comey and assert that the Russia investigation is tainted.\nThe Justice Department denied a request in late July from Mr. Trump\u2019s congressional allies to release Mr. McCabe\u2019s memos, citing a continuing investigation that the lawmakers believed to be Mr. Mueller\u2019s. Mr. Rosenstein not only supervises that investigation but is also considered by the president\u2019s lawyers as a witness for their defense because he sought the dismissal of Mr. Comey, which is being investigated as possible obstruction of justice.", "date": "Sept. 21, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/21/us/politics/rod-rosenstein-wear-wire-25th-amendment.html", "tags": "rod f.b.i officials rosenstein suggested comey recording amendment president mccabe \u201d trump secretly discussed"}
