{"title": "India election 2019: Did the ban on high-value banknotes work?", "content": "In the run-up to the Indian election, which gets under way on 11 April, BBC Reality Check is examining claims and pledges made by the main political parties.\nOne of the most dramatic actions taken by the ruling BJP was the withdrawal in 2016 of all high-value banknotes from circulation, almost overnight.\nThis effectively removed 85% of all cash notes from the economy.\nThe Indian government said this was intended to flush out undeclared wealth and counterfeit money.\nIt also said it would help move India towards an economy less dependent on cash.\nHowever, Reality Check has found that there's little evidence the ban has helped root out illegally held assets.\nAnd compared with other emerging economies, the level of cash in circulation in India has remained high.\nIn November 2016, the two highest notes in circulation - 500 and 1,000 Indian rupees (\u00a311) - were scrapped.\nThe surprise move - referred to in India as \"demonetisation\" - caused widespread confusion and led to street protests.\nFor a limited period only, the withdrawn notes could be exchanged for legal currency at banks - but there was a limit of 4,000 rupees per person.\nCritics said the policy severely disrupted the economy, badly affecting the poor and rural communities that relied on cash. \nThe government said it was targeting illegal wealth held outside the formal economy, which fuelled corruption and other illegal activity and had not been declared for tax purposes.\nIt was assumed that those with large amounts of such cash would now find it difficult to exchange for legal tender.\nBut by August 2018, a report published by India's central bank said that more than 99% of the old banknotes in circulation prior to the ban had been accounted for.\nThis caused some surprise - and led to further criticism of the move.\nIt was suggested that there had not been much unaccounted for wealth held in cash in the first place - or if there had been, the owners had found ways to convert it to legal tender.\nNot really, according to India's central bank.  \nThe number of fake 500 and 1,000 rupee notes found after the ban was only marginally higher than the amount from the previous year. \nThe new notes have features designed to make them harder to counterfeit, but fake versions of these have since been discovered, according to economists at the State Bank of India.\nAnother aim of the policy had been to improve India's poor record on tax collection.\nThe idea was that if more transactions were carried out digitally and in the open, it would be easier to enforce tax payments.\nAn official government report last year said the note ban had indeed resulted in an improved tax take, largely by revealing more tax evaders. \nIn the two years before the currency withdrawal, tax collection growth rates had been in single digits. \nThen in 2016-17, the amount of direct taxes collected increased by 14.5% over the previous year.\nThe following year, collections rose by 18%.\nBut the rate of growth in collecting direct taxes had seen a similar increase between 2008-09 and 2010-11, when the Congress party was in power. \nAnd it's likely that other policies - such as an income tax amnesty in 2016 and a new goods and services tax the following year - may have contributed as much to the growing tax take as demonetisation.\nAgainst a long-term trend of a gradual rise in cashless payments, there is a significant jump at the end of 2016, when the notes were withdrawn.\nBut this reverted soon afterwards to the steady rising trend.\nThe overall increase over time may have less to do with government policy and more to do with changing technology and easier cashless payments.\nAs to whether the overall amount of cash in the economy has fallen, we can look at India's currency to gross domestic product (GDP) ratio over time.\nThis is a measure of the amount of currency in circulation in proportion to the total value of goods and services produced.  \nThis took a sharp dive immediately following the withdrawal of the 500 and 1,000 rupee notes - but by the following year, currency in circulation had reverted to pre-2016 levels.\nAnd not only has cash usage not fallen, India also still has one of the highest levels when compared with other emerging economies.\nRead more from Reality Check\nSend us your questions\nFollow us on Twitter", "date": "12 March 2019", "href": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-46400677", "tags": "work election india tax notes high-value circulation currency economy banknotes cash year government ban"}
