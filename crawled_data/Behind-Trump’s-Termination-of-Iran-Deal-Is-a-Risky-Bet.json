{"title": "Behind Trump\u2019s Termination of Iran Deal Is a Risky Bet", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 For President Trump and two of the allies he values most \u2014 Israel and Saudi Arabia \u2014 the problem of the Iranian nuclear accord was not, primarily, about nuclear weapons. It was that the deal legitimized and normalized Iran\u2019s clerical government, reopening it to the world economy with oil revenue that financed its adventures in Syria and Iraq, its missile program and its support of terrorist groups.\nNow, by announcing on Tuesday that he is exiting the nuclear deal and will reimpose economic sanctions on Iran and companies around the world that do business with the country, Mr. Trump is engaged in a grand, highly risky experiment.\n[Read a full transcript of President Trump\u2019s remarks.]\nMr. Trump and his Middle East allies are betting they can cut Iran\u2019s economic lifeline and thus \u201cbreak the regime,\u201d as one senior European official described the effort. In theory, America\u2019s withdrawal could free Iran to produce as much nuclear material as it wants \u2014 as it was doing five years ago, when the world feared that it was headed toward a bomb.\nBut Mr. Trump\u2019s team dismisses that risk: Iran does not have the economic strength to confront the United States, Israel and Saudi Arabia. And Iran knows that any move to produce a weapon would only provide Israel and the United States with a rationale for taking military action.\nIt is a brutally realpolitik approach that America\u2019s allies in Europe have warned is a historic mistake, one that could lead to confrontation, and perhaps to war.\nAnd it is a clear example of Middle East brinkmanship that runs counter to what President Barack Obama intended when the nuclear deal was struck in July 2015.\nMr. Obama\u2019s gamble in that deal \u2014 the signature foreign policy accord of his eight years in office \u2014 was straightforward. He regarded Iran as potentially a more natural ally of the United States than many of its Sunni-dominant neighbors, with a young, educated Western-oriented population that is tired of being ruled by an aging theocracy.\nBy taking the prospect of nuclear weapons off the table, the Obama administration had argued, the United States and Iran could chip away at three decades of hostility and work on common projects, starting with the defeat of the Islamic State.\nIt did not turn out that way. While the deal succeeded in getting 97 percent of Iran\u2019s nuclear material out of the country, Iran\u2019s conservatives and its military recoiled at the idea of cooperating on any projects with the West.\nMonths before it became clear that Mr. Trump had a decent shot at being elected, the Iranian military increased support for President Bashar al-Assad in Syria; it expanded its influence in Iraq and accelerated its support for terrorist groups. And it doubled down on deploying cyberattacks against targets in the West and in Saudi Arabia, embracing a weapon that was not covered by the nuclear accord.\nThen came Mr. Trump, with his declaration that the deal was a \u201cdisaster\u201d and his vow to dismantle it. That is exactly what he has now done, but at a huge cost.\nMoments after he delivered his statement \u2014 in which he made it sound as if Iran was cheating on the accord, even though his intelligence chiefs have testified otherwise \u2014 Mr. Trump received a stinging rebuke from Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, President Emmanuel Macron of France and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.\nThe three leaders, America\u2019s closest European allies, essentially rejected his logic. They noted that the United Nations Security Council resolution that embraced the Iran deal in 2016 \u201cremains the binding international legal framework for the resolution of the dispute about the Iranian nuclear program.\u201d\nThat was polite diplomatic language for the stark conclusion that it is the United States \u2014 not Iran \u2014 that first violated the accord.\n[Read our coverage of Mr. Trump\u2019s decision and his announcement.]\nAnd now, suddenly, the world may well be headed back to where it was in 2012: on a road to uncertain confrontation, with \u201cvery little evidence of a Plan B,\u201d as Boris Johnson, the British foreign minister, said on a visit to Washington.\nExiting the deal, with or without a plan, is fine with the Saudis. They see the accord as a dangerous distraction from the real problem of confronting Iran around the region \u2014 a problem that Saudi Arabia believes will be solved only by leadership change in Iran.\nThe Saudis have an ally in John R. Bolton, the president\u2019s new national security adviser, who had made clear before taking office that he shared their view. Mr. Obama\u2019s deal, Mr. Bolton said on Tuesday afternoon, featured \u201can utterly inadequate treatment of the military dimension of Iran\u2019s aspirations.\u201d\nThe Saudi case against Iran has been bolstered in recent months by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has repeatedly referred to Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, as \u201cthe new Hitler.\u201d\n\u201cMany countries around the world and in Europe did not realize how dangerous Hitler was until what happened, happened,\u201d Prince Mohammed said in a recent interview with the CBS News program \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to see the same events happening in the Middle East.\u201d\nIn a speech in March at the Brookings Institution, Adel al-Jubeir, the Saudi foreign minister, asserted that Iran was \u201cthe biggest problem we face in our region.\u201d He blamed Iran for interfering in neighboring countries, backing allied armed groups in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Yemen and elsewhere, and supplying Yemeni rebels with ballistic missiles they fired at his country.\nEven if its restrictions on nuclear weapons were tightened and extended, \u201cthe agreement by itself does not solve the problem of Iran,\u201d Mr. Jubeir said. \u201cIran must be held accountable.\u201d\nJeremy Shapiro, research director at the European Council on Foreign Relations and a State Department official during the Obama administration, argued that the nuclear deal\u2019s opposition from Saudi Arabia, Israel and other regional players was primarily about its effects on American politics and policy.\n\u201cThey believe they are in this existential conflict with the Iranian regime, and nuclear weapons are a small part of that conflict\u201d \u2014 but the one that most influences public opinion in the United States, Mr. Shapiro said.\n\u201cIf the deal opened an avenue for better relations between the United States and Iran, that would be a disaster for the Saudis,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need to ensure a motivation for American pressure against Iran that will last even after this administration.\u201d\nIsrael is a more complicated case.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has pressed Mr. Trump to abandon an arrangement that the Israeli leader has always detested. But Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s own military and intelligence advisers say Israel is far safer with an Iran whose pathway to a bomb is blocked, rather than one that is once again pursuing the ultimate weapon.\n\u201cThe individuals who shoulder responsibility for Israel\u2019s survival and security have been crystal clear,\u201d Graham Allison, a Harvard professor who has spent his career examining cases of nuclear proliferation.\n\u201cThis will most likely lead to an outcome that is much worse not only for the U.S., but for Israel,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Allison said, because the current agreement rolled Iran\u2019s nuclear program back a decade \u201cand imposed on Iran the most intrusive inspection regime ever negotiated.\u201d\nBut Mr. Netanyahu holds Israel\u2019s bullhorn, and he used it last week to persuade Mr. Trump to pull the plug on the Iran deal. By releasing Iranian documents, stolen from Tehran in January, Mr. Netanyahu proved what Western intelligence agencies long knew: A decade ago or even longer, the Iranians were working hard to design a nuclear warhead.\nTo Mr. Netanyahu, this was proof that Iran could never be trusted and that it had reached the nuclear deal under false pretenses by pretending it never had a weapons program. To Mr. Trump and his allies, the Israeli discovery said less about Iranian nuclear capability than it did about Iranian perfidy.\nGiven evidence that Iran was preserving its bomb designs as a hedge for the future, the discovery suggested it has not given up its ambitions. As Dennis Ross, a former Middle East negotiator, put it, someone needed to address the Israeli discovery \u201clest they give the Iranians the ability to pick up quickly where they left off on weaponizing.\u201d\nStill, at the core of Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement on Tuesday is a conviction that Mr. Obama made a critical mistake in agreeing to a deal that contains an expiration date. Mr. Trump\u2019s argument is that Iran can never be allowed to accumulate enough material to assemble a bomb.\nSo when the Europeans said that would require reopening the negotiations, Mr. Trump balked, and decided instead to scrap the entire deal.\nIt was a classic Trumpian move, akin to the days when he would knock down New York buildings to make way for visions of grander, more glorious edifices. But in this case, it is about upsetting a global power balance and weakening a government that Mr. Trump has argued, since he began campaigning, must go.", "date": "May 8, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/us/politics/trump-iran-nuclear-deal-news-analysis-.html", "tags": "iran nuclear bet \u201c termination risky trump israel behind \u2014 deal"}
