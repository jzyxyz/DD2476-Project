{"title": "How Michael Cohen Turned Against President Trump", "content": "Michael D. Cohen was at a breaking point. He told friends he was suicidal. He insisted to lawyers he would never go to jail. Most of all, he feared that President Trump, his longtime boss, had forsaken him.\n\u201cBasically he needs a little loving and respect booster,\u201d one of Mr. Cohen\u2019s legal advisers at the time, Robert J. Costello, wrote in a text message to Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u2019s lead lawyer. \u201cHe is not thinking clearly because he feels abandoned.\u201d\nThat was last June. The \u201cbooster\u201d from Mr. Trump never arrived. And by August, Mr. Cohen\u2019s relationship with him had gone from fraught to hostile, casting a shadow on the Trump presidency and helping drive multiple criminal investigations into the president\u2019s inner circle, including some that continued after the special counsel\u2019s work ended.\nIn the biggest blow to the president personally, federal prosecutors in Manhattan effectively characterized Mr. Trump as an unindicted co-conspirator in a criminal case against Mr. Cohen involving hush money payments to a pornographic film actress. Mr. Cohen, and evidence gathered by prosecutors, implicated the president.\nNow, as Mr. Cohen prepares to head to prison in two weeks, dozens of previously unreported emails, text messages and other confidential documents reviewed by The New York Times suggest that his falling out with Mr. Trump may have been avoidable.\nMissed cues, clashing egos, veiled threats and unaddressed money worries all contributed to Mr. Cohen\u2019s halting decision to turn on a man he had long idolized and even once vowed to take a bullet for, according to the documents and interviews with people close to the events. Some of the documents have been turned over to the prosecutors in Manhattan, and a small number were mentioned in the special counsel\u2019s report released on Thursday, which dealt extensively with Mr. Cohen and referred to him more than 800 times.\nMr. Cohen held out hope for a different outcome until the very end, when he pleaded guilty and confessed to paying the illegal hush money to avert a potential sex scandal during the presidential campaign. Just hours earlier, wracked with indecision, he was still seeking guidance, looking, as one informal adviser put it, \u201cfor another way out.\u201d\nMr. Cohen\u2019s anxiety, on display in the documents, played a role in the undoing of his relationship with Mr. Trump, as did Mr. Costello\u2019s lack of success in serving as a bridge to the White House. But also looming large were Mr. Giuliani\u2019s and Mr. Trump\u2019s failures to understand the threat that Mr. Cohen posed, and their inability \u2014 or unwillingness \u2014 to put his financial and emotional insecurities to rest.\nAfter the Federal Bureau of Investigation raided Mr. Cohen\u2019s home, office and hotel room last April, two of Mr. Cohen\u2019s advisers explored whether the president might be open to a pardon, but Mr. Giuliani offered no assurances.\nIn June, Mr. Costello proposed that he and Mr. Giuliani, who have been friends for decades, meet urgently with Mr. Cohen to address his grievances and ease his anxieties. \u201cAre we going to meet Thursday or Friday?\u201d Mr. Costello texted Mr. Giuliani on a Monday. \u201cI would like to get back to Michael with a response.\u201d\nBut Mr. Giuliani did not respond. And when Mr. Costello followed up, \u201cCan I get a response on the possible meeting?\u201d Mr. Giuliani hesitated, replying, \u201cNot yet because haven\u2019t talked to President,\u201d who was out of the country.\nThe next day, Mr. Cohen\u2019s private admission to friends that he was open to cooperating with prosecutors suddenly appeared in the news. And Mr. Cohen relayed his growing displeasure with the Trump camp to Mr. Costello, sending the lawyer an article that suggested the president and his allies intended \u201cto discredit Michael Cohen\u201d and commenting in the email that \u201cthey are again on a bad path.\u201d He also complained to Mr. Costello that the president had stopped covering his legal expenses.\nMr. Costello, who spoke with The Times after Mr. Cohen waived attorney-client privilege in February, said that without Mr. Cohen\u2019s team and the president\u2019s lawyers in sync, it was impossible to navigate the tumultuous relationship.\n\u201cWhat we had here was a failure to communicate,\u201d said Mr. Costello, who was never formally retained by Mr. Cohen. \u201cMy mission was to get everyone tuned in to the same channel. My thought was a face-to-face meeting among all the lawyers together with Cohen would put everyone on the same channel. The meeting never happened, and the rest is history.\u201d\nIn an interview, Mr. Giuliani acknowledged that the Trump team had pulled back from Mr. Cohen, saying it did so because prosecutors might have viewed friendly overtures as witness tampering, and because Mr. Cohen\u2019s legal problems extended beyond his relationship with the president.\n\u201cIt seemed like an unfortunate but sensible decision,\u201d he said of the Trump team\u2019s reticence toward Mr. Cohen. \u201cThe more I look back at it, the more I wonder if it was inevitable that Michael was going to crack.\u201d\nMr. Cohen declined to comment, but his spokesman, Lanny Davis, suggested that the Trump team had initially tried to keep Mr. Cohen in \u201cthe liar\u2019s club\u201d of people covering for the president.\nAfter pleading guilty in August, and hoping to reduce his three-year prison sentence, Mr. Cohen told federal prosecutors about Mr. Trump\u2019s role in the hush-money scheme, as well as other aspects of the president\u2019s company, where he had worked for a decade. He also suggested Mr. Trump\u2019s team had dangled a pardon to keep him loyal, according to Mr. Davis, who described the effort as more an attempt \u201cto keep Cohen in the tent of those lying and protecting Trump than anything else.\u201d\nMr. Giuliani denied that a pardon had been offered. Mr. Costello told prosecutors in a recent meeting that the pardon discussion had been initiated by Mr. Cohen and rejected by Mr. Giuliani.\nUnencumbered by the restraints on the investigation by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, the prosecutors are now scrutinizing a wider swath of the president\u2019s associates. About a dozen investigations are underway, including an inquiry into the Trump inaugural committee, which Mr. Cohen had assisted. Mr. Cohen also delivered congressional testimony that accused Mr. Trump of being a racist and a \u201ccon man.\u201d\nThe relationship between Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump was looking up, at least for a brief period, last April.\nJust days after F.B.I. agents searched his hotel room on Park Avenue, Mr. Cohen received a phone call from the president. \u201cStay strong,\u201d Mr. Trump told him, according to the Mueller report and a person with knowledge of the call.\nMr. Cohen thanked Mr. Trump repeatedly, and later told people the message was clear: The president, who had a history of treating Mr. Cohen poorly, wanted to keep him on his team.\nAs federal prosecutors in Manhattan built a criminal case against Mr. Cohen, he set out to find a lawyer who had experience with the Manhattan United States attorney\u2019s office, known as the Southern District of New York. That\u2019s when an acquaintance at a local law firm emailed him to pitch the services of his colleague Mr. Costello. The firm was eager to become associated with such a high-profile case, and quickly embraced Mr. Cohen.\n\u201cI am really sorry to read about your troubles,\u201d the acquaintance, Jeffrey Citron, wrote. \u201cMy partner Bob Costello was formerly the deputy chief of the criminal division of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office for the Southern District.\u201d He said that if Mr. Cohen wanted to connect with Mr. Costello and obtain \u201chis insight into your situation, it would be my pleasure to arrange.\u201d\nMr. Cohen jumped at the offer: \u201cI do. Can you connect me to him?\u201d\nMr. Cohen met that day with Mr. Citron and Mr. Costello in a conference room at the Loews Regency Hotel, where he had been staying while his home underwent renovations. After drawing the curtains, Mr. Cohen revealed the depths of his despair.\n\u201cI was up on the roof. I was thinking of jumping,\u201d Mr. Cohen told the two men, according to Mr. Costello.\nOver the course of the two-hour meeting, Mr. Cohen and Mr. Costello discussed options for digging out of the mess, including possibly seeking immunity from prosecution in exchange for cooperation. They also talked about whether state prosecutors could charge Mr. Cohen even if the president pardoned him, Mr. Costello said. And they discussed, in passing, Mr. Costello\u2019s friendship with Mr. Giuliani.\nWhen Mr. Giuliani was hired by the president a few days later, Mr. Costello emailed Mr. Cohen: \u201cI told you my relationship with Rudy which could be very very useful for you.\u201d\n\u201cGreat news,\u201d Mr. Cohen replied.\nThe next day, after speaking to Mr. Giuliani by phone, Mr. Costello wrote in an email to Mr. Citron that the president\u2019s lead lawyer had been \u201cthrilled that I reached out to him about Cohen.\u201d He added that Mr. Giuliani was \u201ccalling the president tonight.\u201d\nMr. Costello also shared his upbeat assessment with Mr. Cohen. \u201cI just spoke to Rudy Giuliani and told him I was on your team,\u201d he wrote in an email sent late that night. \u201cRudy was thrilled and said this could not be a better situation for the president or you.\u201d He continued, \u201cHe said thank you for opening this back channel of communication and asked me to keep in touch.\u201d\nMr. Trump praised Mr. Cohen on Twitter the next day, calling him \u201ca fine person\u201d and predicting he would not flip. After another conversation with Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Costello sent Mr. Cohen an update: \u201cThey are in our corner,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cYou have friends in high places.\u201d\nMr. Cohen believed at the time that \u201che had the support of the White House if he continued to toe the party line,\u201d according to the special counsel\u2019s report. \u201cHe determined to stay on message and be part of the team.\u201d\nThe glow faded quickly, however, as a series of developments stoked Mr. Cohen\u2019s suspicions about Mr. Trump\u2019s intentions toward him.\nFirst, later in April, Mr. Giuliani rebuffed Mr. Costello\u2019s question about whether Mr. Trump might entertain the idea of a pardon, according to Mr. Costello. Mr. Cohen also asked his Washington-based lawyer, Stephen Ryan, to make a similar inquiry, and Mr. Giuliani was noncommittal. Mr. Ryan had been working at the time with the president\u2019s legal team to prevent prosecutors from reviewing materials seized in the F.B.I. raids that were protected by attorney-client privilege.\nNext, Mr. Trump called in to the television program \u201cFox & Friends\u201d and tried to minimize the legal work that Mr. Cohen had performed for him \u2014 \u201ca tiny, tiny little fraction,\u201d he said. Those comments appeared to undermine Mr. Cohen\u2019s argument that many of the seized materials might be privileged.\nA week after that, in early May, it was a television appearance by Mr. Giuliani that upset Mr. Cohen.\nUnder an information-sharing agreement among the lawyers, Mr. Ryan had discussed with Mr. Giuliani that the Trumps had reimbursed Mr. Cohen for the hush money he paid to the pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels. Without notifying Mr. Cohen or his representatives, Mr. Giuliani then delivered the revelation on Fox News. Mr. Cohen became concerned that the Trump team was disseminating information about him gleaned from the agreement, and that it was being done with Mr. Trump\u2019s knowledge.\nAs the president\u2019s lead lawyer continued to publicly discuss the hush-money scheme in the days and weeks that followed, Mr. Cohen told associates that Mr. Giuliani was \u201cblowing this whole thing.\u201d\nDays after Mr. Giuliani appeared on Fox News, Mr. Costello confided to Mr. Citron, his partner, about his mounting concerns that Mr. Cohen was stringing them along.\n\u201cThere are simply too many facts that he is not sharing with us to give me a level of comfort,\u201d Mr. Costello wrote to Mr. Citron. He suggested that Mr. Cohen\u2019s distrust of Mr. Giuliani was also a factor. \u201cI do not think that Rudy doing his Press Tour is helping us in our relationship with Michael Cohen,\u201d he wrote.\nSoon after, Mr. Cohen was dealt another blow when confidential financial records were leaked, showing that he had collected more than $1 million in consulting fees from major corporations and from a New York private equity firm tied to a Russian oligarch. With the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, Mr. Cohen was suddenly back in the discussion about Mr. Trump\u2019s ties to Russia.\nMr. Costello emailed him words of encouragement \u2014 \u201ckeep on punching\u201d \u2014 but Mr. Cohen did not reply. Mr. Costello doubled down, later emailing Mr. Cohen in all caps that Mr. Mueller had \u201cREACHED THE CONCLUSION THAT THERE IS NO RUSSIAN ANGLE TO THE MICHAEL COHEN INVESTIGATION OTHERWISE HE WOULD HAVE KEPT THE CASE FOR HIMSELF.\u201d\nMr. Costello made the same point in a text message to Mr. Giuliani, who \u201cthought it was very important to get that message out there,\u201d Mr. Costello recounted in an email to Mr. Citron. But, Mr. Costello said, Mr. Giuliani suggested he could not make that case himself, \u201cbecause it will look like he is defending Michael Cohen.\u201d\nThe challenge, Mr. Costello continued, was \u201cto get Cohen on the right page without giving him the appearance that we are following instructions from Giuliani or the president.\u201d\nBy mid-June, despite warning signs that Mr. Cohen might turn on the president, some members of Mr. Trump\u2019s team concluded that he did not pose a real threat, interviews show. Mr. Giuliani never met with Mr. Cohen, though Mr. Costello had suggested it might help. And the same day that ABC News reported that Mr. Cohen was \u201clikely to cooperate\u201d with prosecutors, Mr. Giuliani appeared on Fox News and played down the possibility of Mr. Cohen\u2019s flipping, saying he had \u201cchecked into this last night\u201d and it was not true.\nThe next day, Mr. Costello sent Mr. Cohen a link to Mr. Giuliani\u2019s interview. And when Mr. Cohen asked, \u201cWhy send this to me?\u201d Mr. Costello explained, \u201cYou are under the impression that Trump and Giuliani are trying to discredit you.\u201d He continued, \u201cI think you are wrong because you are believing the narrative promoted by the left-wing media.\u201d\nMr. Costello also texted Mr. Giuliani a note praising the interview, adding that he had sent a YouTube clip of it to Mr. Cohen in hopes that it would calm him down.\nBut later that month, any good will dissipated when The Times reported that the F.B.I. had seized in its raid a tape recording of Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump from 2016. The two men were discussing hush money paid to another woman, Karen McDougal, who claimed to have had an affair with Mr. Trump.\nEach side blamed the other for the explosive revelation, pushing the relationship to a near breaking point.\nLater in June, Vanity Fair reported that Mr. Cohen had hired a new lawyer \u2014 not Mr. Costello, but Guy Petrillo, a former federal prosecutor who had worked in the Southern District alongside James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director and a Trump foil.\nMr. Costello raised concerns with Mr. Giuliani. \u201cDoes Cohen really want a friend of Comey as his lawyer?\u201d he asked in a text message.\nAt the same time, Mr. Cohen\u2019s concerns about money were reaching a crisis, according to court records. Mr. Trump\u2019s business and campaign had paid about $1.7 million of Mr. Cohen\u2019s legal bills, but stopped paying in June, around the time Mr. Ryan finished reviewing the documents seized in the F.B.I. raid and withdrew from the case. An official with Mr. Ryan\u2019s firm declined to comment.\nMr. Cohen wanted the Trump Organization to also help pay Mr. Petrillo, which never happened.\nIn the interview with The Times, Mr. Giuliani said that he was new to the issue of the legal fees at the time, having just been hired by Mr. Trump a couple of months earlier. He said that the decision was made by the Trump Organization to pay for legal work only if it was expressly connected to Mr. Trump or the company.\nA lawyer for the Trump Organization said Mr. Cohen\u2019s criminal problems were of his own making. \u201cHe should quit lying and take responsibility for his actions,\u201d said the lawyer, Marc L. Mukasey. \u201cThe idea that the Trump Organization should have paid his legal fees and expenses is a total crock.\u201d\nDistrust between the two sides only grew in June when the comedian Tom Arnold tweeted a selfie with Mr. Cohen and later claimed that they were teaming up to take down the president. Mr. Giuliani, sounding alarmed, phoned Mr. Costello while he was having lunch at Bobby Van\u2019s Steakhouse \u2014 the president wanted to know what this was about.\nAfter lunch, Mr. Costello tried to reach Mr. Cohen, who was slow to reply. \u201cIs he totally nuts???\u201d Mr. Costello wrote in frustration to his law partner. \u201cHe is playing with the most powerful man on the planet.\u201d\nWhen Mr. Cohen finally sent along a clarification from Mr. Arnold, Mr. Costello texted Mr. Giuliani. \u201cMake sure your client knows this,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHe will sleep better.\u201d\nMr. Cohen then asked Mr. Costello to make things right with Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Costello recalled, and assure Mr. Trump that he remained loyal. So Mr. Costello had lunch in late June with Mr. Giuliani at the Grand Havana Room on the top floor of 666 Fifth Avenue. Afterward, he assured Mr. Cohen in an email that he had \u201cconveyed all of your expressed concerns\u201d to Mr. Giuliani \u201cfor transmission to his client\u201d \u2014 the president. Mr. Cohen replied, thanking him for \u201cspeaking to your friend.\u201d\nStill, Mr. Cohen heard nothing from the Trump legal team, and no additional legal fees were paid by the Trump Organization.\nBy early July, Mr. Cohen was making overtly hostile moves toward the president. He appeared on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America\u201d and declared, \u201cMy wife, my daughter and my son have my first loyalty and always will.\u201d He deleted the line in his Twitter biography about working for Mr. Trump. And he hired Mr. Davis, a Democrat and a friend of the Clintons, as a spokesman.\nMr. Davis said that he asked Mr. Cohen at the time why he wanted to hire him. \u201cI now fear for my family and my country,\u201d Mr. Davis recalled Mr. Cohen\u2019s saying. \u201cSo I decided to turn and tell the truth \u2014 and ask you to announce I wouldn\u2019t accept a pardon if I was offered one.\u201d\nA person who was familiar with Mr. Cohen\u2019s decision-making at the time said the moves might have been a cry for help, but Mr. Costello and others saw them as evidence that he had \u201cchosen a different path,\u201d as Mr. Costello wrote to Mr. Cohen in an email.\n\u201cWe will not be involved in that journey and therefore Jeff Citron asked me to let you know that he will be sending you a bill,\u201d the email said.\nWithin weeks, Mr. Giuliani, who had previously referred to Mr. Cohen as \u201can honest, honorable lawyer,\u201d was instead casting him as a \u201cpathological liar.\u201d\nHis bond with Mr. Trump all but broken, Mr. Cohen decided to cooperate with law enforcement officials. And so he traveled to Washington to meet on Aug. 7 with Mr. Mueller\u2019s team for the first of many discussions.\nThe next week, his lawyer, Mr. Petrillo, arranged to talk with prosecutors in Manhattan, interviews show. The prosecutors had been putting him off but suddenly agreed to meet a couple of days later, on Friday, an indication that criminal charges against Mr. Cohen were imminent.\nMr. Petrillo asked for a deferred prosecution agreement relating to the hush money, a lighter punishment that might have spared Mr. Cohen from prison so long as he stayed out of trouble. That weekend the prosecutors signaled there would be no such deal, but they were willing to consider a guilty plea.\nOver the next day, Mr. Cohen and his wife huddled in Mr. Petrillo\u2019s office debating their options. And throughout the day on Monday, his lawyers went back and forth with prosecutors over the details of the plea to campaign finance, banking and tax crimes.\nBut that evening, Mr. Cohen was still unsure whether to plead guilty at all. He poured a glass of 12-year-old Glenlivet Scotch on the rocks and debated his future.\nEarly on Tuesday, he was still having second thoughts, but ultimately stuck to the plan. Standing at the defense table, Mr. Cohen said he had worked with Mr. Trump to cover up two potential sex scandals, including the one involving Ms. Daniels. He confessed that he had arranged the hush money \u201cin coordination with, and at the direction of, a candidate for federal office,\u201d implicating the president publicly for the first time in a federal campaign finance crime.\n\u201cTime and time again,\u201d Mr. Cohen later told the judge at his sentencing, \u201cI felt it was my duty to cover up his dirty deeds.\u201d", "date": "April 21, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/21/us/politics/michael-cohen-trump.html", "tags": "prosecutors giuliani turned costello president \u201d trump cohen michael said"}
