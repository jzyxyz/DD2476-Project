{"title": "Here's How 'Game Of Thrones' Cast Members Feel About That Coffee Cup Blunder", "content": "She\u2019s fought the dead, and she\u2019s faced Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey). But Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) took the biggest risk of all on \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d this week when she placed an order at Starbucks ... because you know the barista spelled her name wrong.\n\u201cUmmm, latte for Dayneris?\u201d\u00a0\nFans watching Season 8, Episode 4, titled \u201cThe Last of the Starks,\u201d noticed something peculiar during the post-battle celebration in Winterfell: a coffee cup with a white plastic lid sitting in front of the Mother of Dragons. (Many guessed it was a Starbucks cup, though\u00a0art director Hauke Richter told TMZ the coffee was actually from a local shop in Banbridge, Northern Ireland, near where they filmed.)\nThe to-go cup shows up during the scene when Tormund Giantsbane (Kristofer Hivju) is bragging about the many talents of Jon Snow (Kit Harington).\u00a0\n\u201cMost people get bloody murdered, they stay that way. Not this one,\u201d Tormund says as Dany and her coffee scowl from a distance.\nHivju joked about the mistake when HuffPost spoke to him after the episode aired.\u00a0\n\u201cProduct placement?\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s made of wood and it just looks like a Starbucks cup?\u201d\u00a0\nJohn Bradley, who plays Samwell Tarly, was a little more forthcoming, admitting that the moment was \u201creally unfortunate.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s just one of those things. You can\u2019t be pointing the finger because everybody makes mistakes,\u201d he told HuffPost. \u201cWe\u2019re all trying to create a kind of unique landscape and escape. ... It takes you out of that moment and brings you back in the real world.\u201d\nAlthough Bradley knows the coffee cup\u2019s placement might have distracted fans, he thinks all will be forgiven because, well, accidents happen. (Especially when you have an exhausted crew who just finished shooting\u00a0a 55-night battle sequence.)\n\u201cI think so many shows have human mistakes like that,\u201d Bradley said. \u201cPeople will forgive for that. People are invested in it. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to drag people out of it too much.\u201d\u00a0\nStill, after getting this little peek behind the scenes of the hugely successful HBO show, we couldn\u2019t help but wonder: What is Emilia Clarke\u2019s coffee order?\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of coffee Emilia is drinking, but judging by her performance this year, it\u2019s so strong ... I\u2019ll have a cup, please,\u201d Bradley played along.\nIn a statement to HuffPost, HBO said, \u201cThe latte that appeared in the episode was a mistake. Daenerys had ordered an herbal tea.\u201d\nBradley concluded, \u201cI don\u2019t know what Emilia\u2019s drinking, but the energy she\u2019s giving throughout the season is superb. Her action, her emotion, all that stuff plays on her face. She\u2019s reached such a level of performance and such a level of complexity and such a level of nuance for Daenerys that I\u2019m just entranced by her every time I see her on the screen.\u201d\nEntranced is one way to put it.\u00a0\nvia GIPHY\nBill Bradley contributed reporting.", "date": "\n05/06/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/game-of-thrones-coffee-cup-daenerys_n_5cd031b6e4b0548b735d472f", "tags": "starbucks coffee cup \u201d cast bradley emilia blunder ... thrones feel daenerys members"}
