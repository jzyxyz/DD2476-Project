{"title": "Turkey Frees Pastor Andrew Brunson, Easing Tensions With U.S.", "content": "SAKRAN, Turkey \u2014 A Turkish court on Friday ordered the release of the American pastor Andrew Brunson, ending his 24-month detention and allowing him to fly home, signaling a truce of sorts in a heated diplomatic dispute between Turkey and the United States.\nMr. Brunson, who was accused of spying and aiding terrorists, had been sentenced to 3 years 1 month 15 days in prison. The judge, citing time served, allowed him to leave the country immediately.\nMr. Brunson\u2019s prolonged detention and trial had worsened tensions between the United States and Turkey. President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence personally raised his case several times with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. The United States government imposed financial sanctions. And members of Congress traveled to Turkey to attend his trial.\nAmerican officials said Mr. Brunson\u2019s detention, along with that of about 20 other Turkish-Americans held after a coup attempt in 2016, was an attempt by Ankara to gain leverage in its various disputes with Washington.\nAfter the pastor\u2019s release, Mr. Trump invited him to come to the White House as early as Saturday. \u201cWe\u2019re very honored to have him back here with us,\u201d the president told reporters in Ohio, where he was traveling for a campaign rally. \u201cHe suffered greatly.\u201d\nTurkey is grappling with a growing economic crisis and has been anxious to reduce a fine of billions of dollars that the United States Treasury is expected to impose on the state-owned Turkish bank, Halkbank, for its part in a conspiracy to violate American sanctions against Iran.\nThe decision to free Mr. Brunson came a little over a week after the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi dissident and columnist for The Washington Post, at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. Turkish officials say they believe Mr. Khashoggi was killed inside the consulate, and Ankara may be trying to mend relations with Washington to secure its help in confronting Saudi Arabia, analysts said.\nMr. Trump, however, seemed to want to put distance between the Brunson and the Khashoggi disputes.\n\u201cWe went through a system and we got him out,\u201d he said of Mr. Brunson. \u201cWe tried to get him out for a long time. This has nothing to do with anything, and there\u2019s no deal there at all.\u201d\nAfter the hearing, Mr. Brunson, an evangelical pastor who runs the small Resurrection Church in Izmir, left the courthouse by car and returned to his home before departing for Germany, en route to the United States.\n\u201cThanks be to God,\u201d said the Rev. William Devlin of New York, a supporter who attended every hearing. \u201cPastor Brunson is going home. We thank the court, we thank Turkey and we thank President Erdogan.\u201d\nWashington and Ankara had been involved in complex negotiations over the pastor\u2019s fate for months. American officials had hoped Turkey would also release Serkan Golge, a Turkish-American scientist, and three Turkish citizens who worked at American diplomatic missions.\nThe Brunson case has been one of several disputes between the two countries.\nIn particular, Turkey has requested the extradition from the United States of an Islamist preacher, Fethullah Gulen, whom it accuses of running a terrorist organization and of instigating the 2016 coup attempt. Mr. Erdogan once suggested a swap of the preacher and the pastor.\nMr. Erdogan has also sought to reduce penalties against Halkbank. A bank official, Mehmet Hakan Atilla, was sentenced to 32 months\u2019 imprisonment in May in federal court in Manhattan for his part in the scheme.\nIn July, the two countries came close to agreeing to a coordinated release of Mr. Brunson and Mr. Atilla, but Mr. Erdogan held out for a guarantee that there would be no further prosecutions against Turkey for sanctions violations.\nA Turkish court ordered that Mr. Brunson remain detained, though he was later moved to house arrest. Since August, he had been living with his wife, Norine, at their apartment in an old quarter of the seaside city of Izmir. Turkish courts several times refused his appeal for release on health grounds.\nFaced with Turkey\u2019s continuing refusal to free the pastor, Washington imposed financial sanctions on the Turkish interior minister and justice minister. Days later, Mr. Trump announced that the United States was doubling its tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Turkey, just as the Turkish currency, the lira, began a precipitous fall against the dollar.\nMr. Erdogan vowed that he would not succumb to threats, and announced retaliatory measures, including increased tariffs on imported American cars, alcohol and leaf tobacco.\nThe lira, which has lost nearly 40 percent of its value since the beginning of the year, plunged to a record low, shaking international markets and raising concerns about Ankara\u2019s ability to service its ballooning foreign debt. International credit rating agencies have repeatedly downgraded Turkey\u2019s standing this year.\nThe Trump administration seemed unmoved by Turkey\u2019s perilous economic situation, and continued to demand Mr. Brunson\u2019s release before it addressed Turkey\u2019s other concerns. In a Twitter post in August, Mr. Trump referred to Mr. Brunson as a \u201cgreat patriot hostage.\u201d\n\u201cWe will pay nothing for the release of an innocent man, but we are cutting back on Turkey!\u201d Mr. Trump declared.\nThe Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, also warned in comments to reporters that the government would take further actions if Mr. Brunson was not released quickly.\nMr. Brunson had high-level support from the Trump administration, not least because he and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo belong to the same denomination of the Evangelical Presbyterian Church in the United States, according to Mr. Devlin, the New York pastor.\nIn a statement on Twitter on Friday, Mr. Pompeo said, \u201cPastor Brunson is finally coming home to America, following a long ordeal for the pastor and his family. We hope that the Turkish government will quickly release our other detained U.S. citizens and @StateDept locally employed staff.\u201d\nThe Turkish government had insisted that Mr. Erdogan could not interfere with the judicial process in Turkey. They said Mr. Brunson was charged with serious crimes, including aiding the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, a separatist group that Turkey, the United States and the European Union have designated a terrorist organization.\nAmerican officials said the Turkish prosecutors had presented no credible evidence to support their case, and the trial, which unfolded with a hearing every few months, produced few hard facts to support the notion that Mr. Brunson was involved in terrorism.\nWitnesses, mostly police informants or former members of his church, accused him of voicing support for Kurdish separatists and serving as a link to supply weapons and support to Kurdish rebels in Syria. Mr. Brunson said he had nothing to hide.\nThe few witnesses for the defense who were allowed to testify described Mr. Brunson as apolitical, focused on his religion, and open to Christians of all ethnic origin, including Syrian refugees.\nAt his hearing Friday morning, three of the five witnesses who testified contradicted testimony given by one of the state\u2019s main witnesses, seemingly weakening the case against Mr. Brunson.\nThere had been signs that the two sides were working to resolve the dispute. The political rhetoric was toned down, and after his outbursts against Turkey in August, Mr. Trump stopped posting statements critical of Turkey on Twitter.\nMr. Erdogan increasingly fell back to explaining that he could not dictate actions to an independent judiciary. Some analysts interpreted that as a sign that he was preparing to pass off Mr. Brunson\u2019s release as the decision of the court.\n\u201cI am not in a position to intervene with the judiciary, since Turkey is a constitutional state,\u201d Hurriyet Daily News quoted him as saying on Thursday. \u201cI must obey whatever decision the judiciary gives. All related parties must follow the judicial rulings. Period.\u201d\nTurkish newspapers also noticeably toned down their reporting of the case.\nThe day before Mr. Brunson was released, a small group of Republican and Democratic United States senators issued a statement offering improved ties between the countries as an incentive.\n\u201cIt is our greatest hope that the pastor will finally be allowed to return home to his family in the United States after his hearing tomorrow,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe United States and Turkey are NATO allies and have a number of mutual concerns regarding regional security and stability. It is time that we close this ugly chapter in our relations.\u201d\nAs speculation rose that a deal was near, analysts suggested that Turkey\u2019s economic woes had forced Mr. Erdogan to yield. \u201cThe economic pressure is working,\u201d said Asli Aydintasbas, a senior fellow for the European Council on Foreign Relations.\nSome pointed to the disappearance of Mr. Khashoggi.\n\u201cIt opens a window for Erdogan,\u201d said Soner Cagaptay, director of the Turkish Research Program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \u201cIf he does something favorable, if Brunson can board a plane, the U.S. would help Erdogan over Khashoggi.\u201d", "date": "Oct. 12, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/12/world/europe/turkey-us-pastor-andrew-brunson.html", "tags": "andrew frees turkey united easing states brunson \u201d u.s pastor turkish tensions erdogan"}
