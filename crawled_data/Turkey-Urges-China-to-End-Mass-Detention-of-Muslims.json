{"title": "Turkey Urges China to End Mass Detention of Muslims", "content": "BEIJING \u2014 Turkey has called China\u2019s mass repression of its Uighur Muslim ethnic minority a \u201cgreat shame for humanity\u201d and has urged the Chinese government to close detention camps estimated to hold a million people, a rare rebuke from a majority-Muslim country.\nIn its statement on Saturday, the Turkish Foreign Ministry condemned China\u2019s \u201creintroduction of concentration camps in the 21st century and the policy of systematic assimilation\u201d in its far western region of Xinjiang as a violation of the \u201cfundamental human rights\u201d of Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims.\n\u201cIt is no longer a secret that more than one million Uighur Turks incurring arbitrary arrests are subjected to torture and political brainwashing in internment camps and prisons,\u201d said the statement from Hami Aksoy, the Foreign Ministry spokesman. He called on the international community and the secretary general of the United Nations to take action to end the \u201chuman tragedy.\u201d\nThe statement came in response to a question about recent reports that Abdurehim Heyit, a prominent Uighur folk poet and musician, had died in a Chinese internment camp. According to the Foreign Ministry, Mr. Heyit died while serving the second year of an eight-year prison sentence over one of his songs.\nThe New York Times has been unable to independently confirm Mr. Heyit\u2019s death.\nThe Chinese government did not address reports of the musician\u2019s death in a statement on Sunday, and the Xinjiang regional government did not respond to requests for comment. Later Sunday, however, a video apparently showing Mr. Heyit alive was posted on the Turkish language website of China Radio International, a Chinese official news service.\nIn a statement on Sunday, the Chinese Embassy in Turkey called the Turkish Foreign Ministry\u2019s statement a \u201cserious violation of the facts,\u201d defending its actions in Xinjiang as necessary to combat terrorism and extremist ideology.\n\u201cSince the 1990s, \u2018three forces\u2019 inside and outside China (ethnic separatist forces, religious extremist forces, violent terrorist forces) have planned and organized thousands of violent terrorist incidents in Xinjiang, China, resulting in the injuries and deaths of a large number of innocent people of all ethnic groups,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe sinful acts of these horrific elements have not only seriously undermined the peaceful and stable order of Xinjiang but also the atmosphere of unity and progress.\u201d\nRejecting the Turkish characterization of China\u2019s mass detention program, the Chinese statement said the camps were \u201cteaching and training centers\u201d intended to provide instruction in Mandarin, law and vocational skills, and to rid students of extremist thoughts.\n\u201cThe allegations that the Chinese government is trying to \u2018eliminate\u2019 the ethnic, religious and cultural identity of the Uighurs and other Muslim groups are completely untenable,\u201d it said.\nThe statement from Turkey, which is home to a large community of Chinese Uighurs, came as a surprise to members of the Uighur diaspora, many of whom have been pressuring the governments of predominantly Muslim countries to speak out about China\u2019s crackdown on Muslim communities.\nDespite growing evidence of forced labor, indoctrination and other abuses in Xinjiang, countries like Saudi Arabia, Iran and Pakistan have remained relatively silent on the issue \u2014 a sign, some say, of China\u2019s increasing political and economic clout. While the governments of Malaysia and Indonesia have voiced concerns about the Uighurs, Turkey\u2019s statement is by far the strongest yet from a majority-Muslim country.\n\u201cMany of us have criticized the Turkish government for its stance on the subject, but today many Uighurs expressed their happiness and joy thanks to the Turkish authorities,\u201d Tahir Imin, a Uighur academic and activist, said by telephone from Washington. \u201cThis is very encouraging for us. It gives us strength and hope that the Turkish government can lead the way for the other Muslim nations to bring some more pressure on the Chinese government.\u201d\nTurkey made the statement despite recently receiving a $3.6 billion loan for its energy and transportation sector from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, a state-owned bank.\nThe Chinese crackdown in Xinjiang has targeted more than 100 writers, academics and other Uighur intellectuals, among others, raising fears that it is aimed at erasing the group\u2019s unique ethnic identity and cultural memory.\nAdrian Zenz, a specialist in China\u2019s minority policies who lectures at the European School of Culture and Theology in Korntal, Germany, said that while political calculations were certainly part of Turkey\u2019s decision to speak out, the reported death of Mr. Heyit \u2014 known to many as the \u201cRooster of Xinjiang\u201d because of his voice \u2014 might have been the \u201cdrop in the bucket that caused the bucket to overflow.\u201d\n\u201cHeyit\u2019s popularity transcended boundaries,\u201d Mr. Zenz said. \u201cHe epitomized the cultural connection between Uighurs and the Turkic cultural realm.\u201d\nOver the weekend, Turkic-language social media was flooded with tributes to Mr. Heyit, one of the first Uighur musicians to write about life under Chinese rule. Many reposted videos of his performances of traditional Uighur songs accompanied by the dutar, a two-stringed lute.\n\u201cMusic is one of the most important parts of Uighur culture,\u201d Mr. Heyit told The  Times in an interview in Kashgar in 1999. \u201cPeople here can wear American T-shirts, but their hearts stay the same. The music, because it\u2019s such a symbol of the heart, changes slowly.\u201d", "date": "Feb. 10, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/10/world/asia/china-turkey-uighurs.html", "tags": "turkey china xinjiang end heyit turkish urges muslims \u201d uighur statement chinese detention mass"}
