{"title": "Brexit: The five questions everyone's asking Google", "content": "We all do it - we don't quite understand something, so we reach for our phones and Google it.\nAnd Brexit is no different.\nHere we answer the five most-googled questions to do with Brexit over the past 24 hours.\nDon't worry, we promise to keep it simple.\nBrexit - short for \"British exit\" - is the process of the UK leaving the EU (European Union). \nThe EU is a group of 28 countries which trade with each other and allow anyone to easily move between the countries to live and work.\nThe UK had a referendum in June 2016 where it voted to leave the EU, which it's been part of for more than 40 years. \nBut the exit didn't happen straight away - it's happening on 29 March 2019.\nAfter Brexit was voted for, negotiations started between the UK and the EU.\nThe negotiations are over the \"divorce\" deal. This is a withdrawal agreement which sets out how exactly we leave the EU - not what will happen after we leave. \nOn Wednesday, Prime Minister Theresa May presented that deal. Here are some key points:\nThis has been one of the biggest sticking points of the whole thing.\nNeither the UK or the EU want a visible or \"hard\" border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland with guard posts and checks. \nSo they've agreed to put in place a \"backstop\" - that's just another word for a deal to make sure a hard border never happens.\nIt would mean that Northern Ireland - but not the rest of the UK - would still follow some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards.\nThe backstop would only be introduced if a trade deal between the EU and the UK isn't sorted out during the transitional period.\nBut this bit is controversial. Some people say it means the UK would still be tied to EU rules while others don't like the idea of Northern Ireland having different regulations to the rest of the UK.\nOn 25 November, the prime minister will try and get European leaders to officially back the deal.\nIf approved, she then has to take it to MPs for a vote in Parliament. That's expected to happen in December.\nAt the moment it looks like her deal would be defeated.\nShe doesn't have enough Conservative MPs to force it through and there are MPs from all parties who aren't happy with what's being suggested.\nWell, it is written into UK law that Brexit is going to happen.\nBut some people are calling for a second referendum (they call it a \"People's Vote\"), which would basically ask the question: \"Do you want the UK to leave the EU, now we know what the deal is?\"\nIf that happened, then Brexit could potentially be reversed - but Theresa May has repeatedly said there won't be another referendum.\n*The list of most searched for questions was provided by Google Trends.\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 every weekday on BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra - if you miss us you can listen back here.", "date": "16 November 2018", "href": "https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-46236022", "tags": "brexit uk eu five leave everyone asking happen northern ireland referendum questions google deal"}
