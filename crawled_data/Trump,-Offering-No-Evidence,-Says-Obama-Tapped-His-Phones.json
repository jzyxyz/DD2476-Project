{"title": "Trump, Offering No Evidence, Says Obama Tapped His Phones", "content": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. \u2014 President Trump on Saturday accused former President Barack Obama of tapping his phones at Trump Tower the month before the election, leveling the explosive allegation without offering any evidence.\nMr. Trump called his predecessor a \u201cbad (or sick) guy\u201d on Twitter as he fired off a series of messages claiming that Mr. Obama \u201chad my \u2018wires tapped.\u2019\u201d He likened the supposed tapping to \u201cNixon/Watergate\u201d and \u201cMcCarthyism,\u201d though he did not say where he had gotten his information.\nA spokesman for Mr. Obama said any suggestion that the former president had ordered such surveillance was \u201csimply false.\u201d\nDuring the 2016 campaign, the federal authorities began an investigation into links between Trump associates and the Russian government, an issue that continues to dog Mr. Trump. His aides declined to clarify on Saturday whether the president\u2019s allegations were based on briefings from intelligence or law enforcement officials \u2014 which could mean that Mr. Trump was revealing previously unknown details about the investigation \u2014 or on something else, like a news report.\nBut a senior White House official said that Donald F. McGahn II, the president\u2019s chief counsel, was working to secure access to what Mr. McGahn believed to be an order issued by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court authorizing some form of surveillance related to Mr. Trump and his associates.\nThe official offered no evidence to support the notion that such an order exists. It would be a highly unusual breach of the Justice Department\u2019s traditional independence on law enforcement matters for the White House to order it to turn over such an investigative document.\nAny request for information from a top White House official about a continuing investigation would be a stunning departure from protocols intended to insulate the F.B.I. from political pressure. It would be even more surprising for the White House to seek information about a case directly involving the president or his advisers, as does the case involving the Russia contacts.\nAfter the White House received heavy criticism for the suggestion that Mr. McGahn would breach Justice Department independence, a different administration official said that the earlier statements about his efforts had been overstated. The official said the counsel\u2019s office was looking at whether there was any legal possibility of gleaning information without impeding or interfering with an investigation. The counsel\u2019s office does not know whether an investigation exists, the official said.\nLast month, Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, came under fire for asking a top F.B.I. official to publicly rebut news reports about contacts between Trump campaign officials and the Russian government.\nSean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said in a statement that the \u201cWhite House counsel is reviewing what options, if any, are available to us.\u201d Mr. McGahn did not respond to a request for comment. He was traveling on Saturday to Florida to join the president at his estate, Mar-a-Lago.\nThe president\u2019s decision on Saturday to lend the power of his office to accusations against his predecessor of politically motivated wiretapping \u2014 without offering any proof \u2014 was remarkable, even for a leader who has repeatedly shown himself willing to make assertions that are false or based on dubious sources.\nIt would have been difficult for federal agents, working within the law, to obtain a wiretap order to target Mr. Trump\u2019s phone conversations. It would have meant that the Justice Department had gathered sufficient evidence to convince a federal judge that there was probable cause to believe Mr. Trump had committed a serious crime or was an agent of a foreign power, depending on whether it was a criminal investigation or a foreign intelligence one.\nFormer officials pointed to longstanding laws and procedures intended to ensure that presidents cannot wiretap a rival for political purposes.\n\u201cA cardinal rule of the Obama administration was that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice,\u201d said Kevin Lewis, a spokesman for Mr. Obama. \u201cAs part of that practice, neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any U.S. citizen.\u201d\nMr. Trump asserted just the opposite in a series of five Twitter messages beginning just minutes before sunrise in Florida, where the president is spending the weekend.\nIn the first message, the president said he had \u201cjust found out\u201d that \u201cObama had my \u2018wires tapped\u2019 in Trump Tower\u201d before the election. Mr. Trump\u2019s reference to \u201cwires tapped\u201d raised the possibility that he was referring to some other type of electronic surveillance and was using the idea of phone tapping loosely.\nThe president was adamant in conversations with several people throughout the day on Saturday that he believed he was right about the wiretaps, according to three people with direct knowledge of those conversations.\nTwo people close to Mr. Trump said they believed he was referring to a Breitbart News article, which aides said had been passed around among his advisers. Mark Levin, a conservative radio host, had also embraced the theory recently in a push against what right-leaning commentators have been calling the \u201cdeep state.\u201d\nThe Breitbart article, published on Friday, claimed that there was a series of \u201cknown steps taken by President Barack Obama\u2019s administration in its last months to undermine Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and, later, his new administration.\u201d Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist, once led Breitbart News.\nIf Mr. Trump was motivated to take to Twitter after reading the Breitbart article or listening to Mr. Levin, he was using a presidential megaphone to spread dark theories of a broad conspiracy aimed at undermining his presidential ambitions, and later his presidency.\nEven with the Breitbart article circulating, several of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers were stunned by the president\u2019s morning Twitter outburst. Those advisers said they were uncertain about what specifically Mr. Trump was referring to; one surmised that he may also have been referring to a months-old news report about a secret surveillance warrant for communications at his New York offices.\nOne senior law enforcement official from the Obama administration, who has direct knowledge of the F.B.I. investigation into Russia and of government wiretapping, said that it was \u201c100 percent untrue\u201d that the government had wiretapped Mr. Trump. The official, who asked for anonymity to discuss matters related to investigations and intelligence, said the White House owed the American people an explanation for the president\u2019s allegations.\nBen Rhodes, a former top national security aide to Mr. Obama, said in a Twitter message directed at Mr. Trump on Saturday that \u201cno president can order a wiretap\u201d and added, \u201cThose restrictions were put in place to protect citizens from people like you.\u201d\nThe House and Senate Intelligence Committees are moving forward with their own investigations into Russia\u2019s efforts to influence the election, and they have said they will examine links between Mr. Trump\u2019s associates and the Russians.\nSenator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, said on Friday that he believed there were \u201ctranscripts\u201d that would help document those contacts, though he said he had not yet seen them.\n\u201cThere are transcripts that provide very helpful, very critical insights into whether or not Russian intelligence or senior Russian political leaders \u2014 including Vladimir Putin \u2014 were cooperating, were colluding, with the Trump campaign at the highest levels to influence the outcome of our election,\u201d Mr. Coons told Andrea Mitchell on MSNBC. \u201cI believe they exist.\u201d\nIn a written statement on Saturday, a spokesman for Mr. Coons said that the senator \u201cdid not imply that he is aware of transcripts indicating collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians.\u201d The spokesman, Sean Coit, said Mr. Coons had \u201csimply stated that a full review of all relevant transcripts and intelligence intercepts is necessary to determine if collusion took place.\u201d\nThe New York Times reported in January that among the associates whose links to Russia are being scrutinized are Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump\u2019s onetime campaign chairman; Carter Page, a businessman and foreign policy adviser to the campaign; and Roger Stone, a longtime Republican operative who said he was in touch with WikiLeaks at one point before it released a trove of emails from John D. Podesta, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, last August. Mr. Stone later said he had communicated with WikiLeaks through an intermediary.\nMr. Trump appeared on Saturday to suggest that warrants had been issued by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. He claimed that the Obama administration had once been \u201cturned down by court\u201d in its supposed efforts to listen in on conversations by Mr. Trump and his associates.\nIn the fall, the F.B.I. examined computer data showing an odd stream of activity between a Trump Organization server and Alfa Bank, one of Russia\u2019s biggest banks, whose owners have longstanding links to Mr. Putin. While some F.B.I. officials initially believed that the computer activity indicated an encrypted channel between Moscow and New York, the bureau ultimately moved away from that view. The activity remains unexplained.\nThere is no confirmed evidence that the F.B.I. obtained a court warrant to wiretap the Trump Organization or was capturing communications directly from the Trump Organization.\nDuring the transition, the F.B.I. \u2014 which uses FISA warrants to eavesdrop on the communications of foreign leaders inside the United States \u2014 overheard conversations between the Russian ambassador to the United States and Michael T. Flynn, whom Mr. Trump had named national security adviser.\nMr. Trump has pointedly and repeatedly questioned in conversations how it was that Mr. Flynn\u2019s conversations were recorded, and wondered who could have issued a warrant.\nAfter The Washington Post reported that Mr. Flynn and the ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak, had discussed sanctions that the Obama administration had just imposed on Russia, Mr. Flynn was pushed out of his post by the White House because he had lied to Vice President Mike Pence about the nature of the calls.\nThe Breitbart article cited mainstream news reports and concluded \u2014 going beyond the public record \u2014 that the Obama administration had \u201cobtained authorization to eavesdrop on the Trump campaign; continued monitoring the Trump team even when no evidence of wrongdoing was found; then relaxed the N.S.A. rules to allow evidence to be shared widely within the government.\u201d\nMr. Levin, a day earlier, railed about what he called a \u201cmuch bigger scandal,\u201d claiming \u2014 again with no proof \u2014 that Mr. Obama and his aides had used \u201cthe instrumentalities of the federal government, intelligence activity, to surveil members of the Trump campaign and put that information out in the public.\u201d\nSeveral senior members of Mr. Trump\u2019s White House staff did not respond to an email requesting on-the-record responses to more than a half-dozen questions about Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter posts.\nRepresentative Adam B. Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, denounced the \u201cwillingness of the nation\u2019s chief executive to make the most outlandish and destructive claims without providing a scintilla of evidence to support them.\u201d\nEven some Republican lawmakers questioned Mr. Trump\u2019s accusations. Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska issued a statement demanding that the president reveal everything he knows about any wiretaps or warrants.\n\u201cThe president today made some very serious allegations, and the informed citizens that a republic requires deserve more information,\u201d Mr. Sasse said, adding that \u201cwe are in the midst of a civilization-warping crisis of public trust.\u201d\nTaping calls seems to hold a spot in Mr. Trump\u2019s consciousness. He spent many years taping his own phone calls as a businessman. During the campaign, Mr. Trump\u2019s staff members told reporters they feared that their offices were being bugged.\nBut Mr. Trump\u2019s latest allegations represented a sharp change in his tone toward Mr. Obama.\nThe current president has frequently spoken about how much he admires Mr. Obama for the gracious way he handled the transition. But since taking office, Mr. Trump has frequently clashed with the intelligence agencies over the Russia inquiries, including efforts to examine the attempts by that country to influence the presidential election and the contacts between Mr. Trump\u2019s aides and the Russian government.\nIn recent days, the president has appeared increasingly angry about leaks of information that he believes are coming from law enforcement and intelligence officials who are holdovers or recently departed from Mr. Obama\u2019s administration.\nPeople close to Mr. Trump have described him as determined to stop those people from sabotaging his administration. One adviser said on Friday that the president had been discussing a possible plan to try to prevent leaks from occurring. The adviser declined to elaborate on what the plan might entail.\nTwo senior administration officials said Mr. Trump had tried for two days to find a way to be on an offensive footing against the news articles resulting from leaks; one person close to Mr. Trump said his explosive claim was a result of that.\nMr. Trump\u2019s mood was said to be volatile even before he departed for his weekend in Florida, with an episode in which he vented at his staff. The president\u2019s ire was trained in particular on Mr. McGahn, his White House counsel, according to two people briefed on the matter.\nMr. Trump was said to be frustrated about the decision by Jeff Sessions, his attorney general, to recuse himself from participating in any investigations of connections between the Trump campaign and Russia. Mr. Trump has said there were no such connections. Mr. Trump, who did not learn that Mr. Sessions was recusing himself until after the decision was made, told aides that it gave an opening to his critics on the Russia issue.", "date": "March 4, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/04/us/politics/trump-obama-tap-phones.html", "tags": "evidence president offering \u201d trump phones house white says obama tapped \u2014"}
