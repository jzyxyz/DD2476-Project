These people are allowed to put their seal on the machine, and nobody can open the machine without breaking the seals.\"\nThe researchers said the paper and wax seals could be easily faked. \nHowever, for their system to have any impact they would need to install their microchips on many voting machines, no easy task when 1,368,430 were used in the last general election in 2009.", "date": "18 May 2010", "href": "https://www.bbc.com/news/10123478", "tags": "us electronic election india voting machines university say machine device scientists display"}
