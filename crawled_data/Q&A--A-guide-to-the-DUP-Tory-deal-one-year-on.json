{"title": "Q&A: A guide to the DUP-Tory deal one year on", "content": "Tuesday marks a year to the day since Theresa May's Conservatives sealed a deal with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) in order to keep the government afloat.\nIt's known as a confidence-and-supply arrangement - meaning the government agreed a financial package with the DUP in exchange for support on certain issues.\nHere's a guide to everything that happened in the lead-up to the agreement, what was included in the deal and how it has been working for the past 12 months. \nAfter Mrs May called the snap general election last June, she did not do as well as she'd hoped and ended up without a Commons majority. \nThe Conservatives got 318 seats, four short of the number a prime minister needs (technically it should be 326 seats - half of the overall number of MPs - but Sinn F\u00e9in's policy of abstentionism means its MPs do not take their seats). \nThat spelled bad news for Mrs May, as it meant her government could be defeated on crucial Brexit votes during the UK-EU negotiations. In order to get around that, she looked to the DUP and its 10 MPs, to help give her a working majority of 328.\nAt just three pages long, the deal sets out what the DUP agreed to support the Conservatives on, in exchange for financial support for Northern Ireland. \nIt also states that the two parties would set up a coordination committee to oversee how the agreement would work in practice. \nThe deal contains an assurance from the Conservatives that they will \"never be neutral in expressing their support for the union\". \nIt also includes a commitment from the government to uphold the Good Friday, or Belfast Agreement (the 1998 deal that brought 30 years of conflict in Northern Ireland to an end) and a clause that the deal will remain in place for the length of this Parliament (usually five years). \nThere is also a commitment that it will be reviewed by both parties at the end of each parliamentary session.\nBecause it is not in coalition with the Conservatives. Rather, the two sides negotiated the confidence and supply arrangement. In exchange for support on key votes on Brexit, security and budgets, the DUP got money for Northern Ireland as well as the ear of the prime minister. \nThe party negotiated an extra \u00a31bn in spending for Northern Ireland over 2018 and 2019. The deal, however, specified that the DUP is not tied-in to supporting the government on every matter.\nIn the months following, there was concern that the money would only be able to be spent when Stormont was restored. \nBut in March, the government announced that \u00a3410m of the \u00a31bn deal would be included in a new Stormont budget with money dished out to various areas. \nDowning Street has said that so far \u00a3430m has been released. In 2017/18, \u00a320m was given to health and education while the \u00a3410m allocated for the Stormont budget is currently going through parliamentary approval procedures. \nMoney for health was recently allocated to improve emergency department services in County Down. \nIn April, the government said a consultation would take place to see how the \u00a3150m for broadband could best be used. It is understood that it could be 2020 before that investment materialises.\nViewed as shrewd negotiators from decades of talks in the Northern Ireland peace process, the DUP also gained guarantees from the Conservatives on a range of policy priorities - such as keeping the guarantee to increase state pensions by at least 2.5% a year, to maintain defence spending, and agriculture spending in Northern Ireland at the same level for the rest of the current parliament (which theoretically takes us to June 2022). \nNot exactly. The DUP's deep religious roots mean it staunchly opposes abortion and same-sex marriage. \nWhen the deal was announced, there was criticism of Mrs May from some of her own MPs who did not want their party to be associated with the DUP's views. \nSouth Cambridgeshire MP Heidi Allen told the Commons she could \"barely contain her anger\" at the agreement.  \nThe former Conservative Party chair Lord Patten even described the deal as \"toxic\". Scotland and Wales also expressed concerns that Northern Ireland could get special treatment from the government.\nWhen the deal was reached, power-sharing in Northern Ireland had stalled. The DUP-Sinn F\u00e9in executive had collapsed six months earlier, after a scandal concerning a flawed green energy scheme. \nSeveral rounds of talks chaired by the British government had failed - and when the DUP-Tory deal was announced some argued it had set the process back even further, making it harder for the British government to play its traditional role of neutral mediator. \nA year on, there's been no restoration of Stormont or implementation of direct rule from Westminster, leaving Northern Ireland in limbo. \nThe government says it is still committed to getting devolution up and running again, but has been criticised by other Stormont parties for being too close to the DUP.\nWhile the DUP has stood by its promise to back the government on Brexit votes in the Commons, things were not so rosy last December. \nJust six months into the arrangement, the DUP threatened mutiny after criticising a proposal between the UK and the EU about the future of the Irish border. \nThe DUP said its red line was any situation where Northern Ireland was treated differently from the rest of the UK. It forced the government to retreat from that plan, and to date, there has not been enough progress on the border question to allow the UK and EU to settle on a way forward. \nThis issue could cause more rifts between the DUP and the Conservatives for some time to come.\nThat depends on who you ask. \nTechnically, it could last as long as the two parties agree to keep the agreement in place. Potentially up until the next general election is called. \nBut coalitions and minority governments, no matter the form they take, are not often thought of as stable settings for governance - particularly in this period with uncertainty around Brexit and the stalemate at Stormont. The DUP's deputy leader Nigel Dodds has insisted that it is \"not a temporary two-year deal\", but Mrs May might not be just as confident.", "date": "26 June 2018", "href": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-politics-44397110", "tags": "q support may one northern guide ireland year could conservatives government stormont dup deal dup-tory"}
