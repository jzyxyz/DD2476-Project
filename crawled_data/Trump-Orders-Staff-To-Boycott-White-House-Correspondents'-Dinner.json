{"title": "Trump Orders Staff To Boycott White House Correspondents' Dinner", "content": "The Trump administration has ordered officials to boycott the annual White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner, scheduled to take place on Saturday, according to multiple reports.\nWhite House Cabinet Secretary Bill McGinley reportedly delivered the message to agency chiefs of staff on Tuesday, indicating the order came directly from President Donald Trump.\n\u201cThe President and members of his administration will not attend the White House Correspondents Dinner this year,\u201d\u00a0The White House said in a statement to CBS.\u00a0\nTrump, meanwhile, launched a tirade against the press on Tuesday morning in a series of tweets attacking The New York Times, CNN and what he called the \u201cFake News Media.\u201d\nThe president also reiterated his announcement from earlier this month\u00a0that he plans to hold a political rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin, on the night of the dinner.\n\u201cThe dinner is so boring and so negative that we\u2019re going to hold a very positive rally,\u201d Trump told reporters on April 5.\nThe White House Correspondents\u2019 Association, which hosts the annual fundraising event and represents the White House press corps in dealings with the administration, responded to the boycott on Tuesday.\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to an enjoyable evening of celebrating the First Amendment and great journalists past, present, and future,\u201d said WHCA President Olivier Knox in a statement posted on Twitter.\nThis will mark the third year in a row Trump has skipped the annual gala, which has in years past featured light remarks from presidents and routines from comedians who often use the platform to roast the guests.\nLast year\u2019s performance by comedian Michelle Wolf featured a string of biting jokes aimed at the president and administration officials that upset the White House, as well as some in the WHCA. The association subsequently announced it had invited\u00a0author Ron Chernow to speak\u00a0instead of booking a comedian for this year\u2019s event.\n\u201cThe White House Correspondents\u2019 Association has asked me to make the case for the First Amendment and I am happy to oblige,\u201d Chernow said in a release in November. \u201cWhile I have never been mistaken for a stand-up comedian, I promise that my history lesson won\u2019t be dry.\u201d", "date": "\n04/23/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-white-house-correspondents-dinner-boycott_n_5cbf4cb2e4b0cee670399ed1", "tags": "dinner administration president correspondents white trump house \u201d association orders boycott staff"}
