{"title": "\u2018Let Us Have a Childhood\u2019: On the Road With the Parkland Activists", "content": "Six months and a day after a gunman massacred 17 of their classmates and staff, the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School woke up Wednesday and began a new year.\nFor the past two months, a busload of them have traveled the country in pursuit of stricter gun laws, connecting with local activists, holding rallies, debating counterprotesters and, above all, registering voters. \nThey knew perfectly well how many before them \u2014 after Columbine, after Sandy Hook, after Orlando \u2014 had been unable to turn outrage into lasting change. But this time was different. Since the shooting, state legislatures have passed at least 50 gun regulations, largely because of public pressure created by the Parkland movement. So The New York Times spent three days on the road with the March for Our Lives activists to find out what changed.\nThey started the day where the sit-ins began nearly 60 years ago, at a Woolworth\u2019s lunch counter pristinely preserved within the International Civil Rights Center and Museum.\nRemember, said the museum\u2019s chief executive, John L. Swaine, the movement that would desegregate lunch counters across the South started with just four people \u2014 and they were your age.\nFrom the sunny lobby, the students descended into the galleries. They saw the lunch counter. They saw a brick archway engraved with the words \u201cCOLORED ENTRANCE.\u201d They saw an image of Emmett Till\u2019s mutilated body.\nAt the end, they saw a wall covered in a mosaic of civil rights activists\u2019 faces. Here and there were blank spaces. \u201cWe left them open for you,\u201d said their tour guide, Dillon Tyler.\nIt was, he said, his \u201ctrue honor\u201d to give them this tour \u2014 because 12 years ago, it was his school that was shot up. \nMr. Tyler, now 26, was a freshman at Orange High School in Hillsborough, N.C., when a gunman came in 2006. Though no one was killed there, \u201cwe were trapped in that school for five hours,\u201d he said, his voice breaking. \u201cMeanwhile, all you heard was bullets and screams.\u201d\nThe room was silent as he finished speaking. Then Sara Jado, 18, a member of March for Our Lives Greensboro, emerged from the crowd and hugged him. For more than 10 seconds, she did not let go.\nAs Ms. Jado retreated, Emma Gonz\u00e1lez, 18, stepped forward. Then another student. And another. They didn\u2019t speak. They just opened their arms, and Mr. Tyler cried on their shoulders.\nThese are the bonds that linked everyone on this tour: trauma, and fear, and the knowledge that any of them could be next. Some fell asleep to the sound of gunfire as children in Chicago or Milwaukee. Now they were meeting with people who bore the scars of mass shootings more than a decade old. And they were joined by 15-year-olds who spoke casually about which classrooms had good escape routes, and which ones they were likely to die in.\n\u201cLet us have a childhood,\u201d Anne Joy Cahill-Swenson, a rising sophomore at Grimsley High School in Greensboro, told the crowd at LeBauer Park that evening. \u201cThis is not something we should have to worry about.\u201d\nAcross the street, a dozen or so counterprotesters with red MAGA caps, \u201cI Plead the 2nd\u201d posters and a QAnon sign were on the sidewalk, shouting at Matt Deitsch, a 2016 graduate of Stoneman Douglas and the chief strategist for March for Our Lives.\n\u201cViolence will happen if people try to take guns away from us,\u201d warned one of them, Jason Passmore, 33. \nMr. Deitsch, 20, has a seemingly endless supply of statistics, and he chooses his words carefully. \u201cPeople define \u2018assault weapon\u2019 in entirely different ways,\u201d he said later. \u201cPeople define \u2018gun control\u2019 in completely different ways. And for the most part, we\u2019ve tried to back away from using those terms.\u201d\nSometimes this works. Ramon Contreras, 19, who founded Youth Over Guns after a friend was killed, recalled that at a tour stop in Texas, he and a counterprotester came \u201cthis close\u201d to agreeing on the need for safe storage of firearms. They exchanged contact information and still talk. \nOther times, it doesn\u2019t work. \n\u201cI love this country,\u201d Mr. Deitsch told the protesters in North Carolina at one point.\n\u201cDo you?\u201d Nancy Browning said doubtfully.\nBut an interesting thing happens when you start talking. It turns out Ms. Browning, 45, supports closing a gun show loophole and banning bump stocks. And universal background checks? \u201cAbsolutely!\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody should just be able to go get a gun.\u201d\n\u201cI just don\u2019t want them to come in and just want to completely blame guns for everything,\u201d she added. \u201cThe gun is not the problem.\u201d\nHere lies the disconnect: the chasm between the policies March for Our Lives promotes and the policies many opponents think it promotes. The students don\u2019t want to abolish gun ownership. Some of their families own guns.\nThere is also an irony to the objection that they \u201cblame guns for everything.\u201d They don\u2019t. At every stop, they emphasize that gun violence can\u2019t be addressed without addressing what fuels it: racism, poverty, substandard schools and mental health services. They speak daily about intersectionality, systems of oppression, the school-to-prison pipeline.\nIn fact, they talk about these things so much that it\u2019s easy to forget they are, well, teenagers. People who hold an impromptu dance party outside a theater when one of them starts banging out the \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d theme on a bright green piano. People who talk about prom and mock each other\u2019s pool shots and stuff cupcakes into their mouths whole.\nHalf an hour before the students\u2019 panel on Thursday, the line outside the Lyric Theater stretched so far that people in the back fretted they would be turned away. \nInside, the eight panelists assembled. Only two, Ryan Deitsch and Lauren Hogg, were Parkland students. The others were Mr. Contreras, from New York; Tallulah Costa and Louis Garcia, high schoolers in Roanoke, Va.; Matt Post, a recent high school graduate from Maryland; Geoffrey Preudhomme, of the Radford University Young Democrats; and Ryan Wesdock, of the Virginia Green Party.\nIt was as good an illustration as any of how the Parkland students wanted to organize the movement. They were adamant that it was not their movement. They understood that they wouldn\u2019t have such a platform if their town were not wealthy and mostly white \u2014 the sort of place where senseless violence is not \u201csupposed\u201d to happen.\n\u201cWhen we did the Peace March on the South Side of Chicago, they\u2019ve been doing that for years \u2014 but all of a sudden, now that we showed up there, there were 10,000 people instead of 500,\u201d said David Hogg, 18. Last month, he added, he and the other students met a teenager in Oakland, Calif., who had lost 20 friends to gun violence, but Americans don\u2019t know their names.\nThis dynamic can be demoralizing for the people working without recognition. Bria Smith, 17, from Milwaukee, said she had spent a year working with local nonprofits and Black Lives Matter, but felt no one was listening. \u201cWhy would I do so much work and give so much energy of myself to a city that doesn\u2019t care if I\u2019m doing it in the first place?\u201d she asked.\nThen she spoke at the March for Our Lives rally in Milwaukee, which led to a seat on a panel when the bus tour went there. Afterward, she recalled, an organizer asked if she wanted to join for more stops. (Her reply: \u201cGive me a second. I have to call my mom and ask her first.\u201d)\nMs. Smith used to see Milwaukee as a prison to escape. But now, \u201cI\u2019ve met so many different youth who had wanted to make a difference in their communities, but never knew how to use their voice and their platform to do that,\u201d she said. \u201cSo after Road to Change, I\u2019m going to come back, and I\u2019m going to go to Milwaukee, and I\u2019m going to be that voice for all the people who felt hopeless.\u201d\nThis is the biggest change of all. The students defined the problem itself differently, as gun violence writ large: not just mass shootings but gang killings, police brutality, domestic abuse, suicide. They talked about sharing their platform and using it to \u201craise the voices\u201d of the activists who have been organizing in obscurity \u2014 several of whom, like Ms. Smith and Mr. Contreras, joined the tour. They tried to build infrastructure everywhere they went, coordinating with local people who would continue the work when the bus was gone.\nAbove all, they urged young people to vote. Many of their proposals already have widespread support. It\u2019s Congress and state legislatures, they say, that don\u2019t reflect the will of the people.\nBy 6 p.m. on Friday, Ms. Gonz\u00e1lez was lying on the floor of a back room at the Westminster Presbyterian Church, answering questions with her eyes closed.\nShe was getting a cold. Mr. Hogg, cross-legged next to her, was getting over one. At least two other students were sick, too. None of them were getting enough sleep. \nEarlier, the students had met with Susan Bro, whose daughter, Heather Heyer, was killed here a year ago this week when a white supremacist drove into a crowd.\n\u201cSome of you may have experienced this \u2014 it\u2019s hard to get out of bed, because I can get weighed down in the grief,\u201d Ms. Bro, 61, told them. \u201cAnd then I\u2019m like, \u2018No, there\u2019s work to do.\u2019\u201d\nThe work is grueling. Jaclyn Corin, 17, contacted every local organizer before every event, and spent every day \u201cgoing to events while organizing future events at the same time.\u201d Before the shooting, she had 100 contacts in her phone. Now, she has over 600.\n\u201cMy texts never stop coming in,\u201d she said. \u201cI will wake up at 2 o\u2019clock in the morning in the middle of the night to get a drink of water, and I\u2019ll answer my five texts that I missed in those two hours that I was sleeping.\u201d\nShe and the rest of the students run the show. The handful of adults with them were there mainly to handle things that minors can\u2019t, like booking hotel rooms.\n\u201cWe entirely control everything we do,\u201d Mr. Hogg said. \u201cAnybody above 20 on the bus works for us.\u201d\nThis is exhausting. It\u2019s also empowering.\n\u201cI just remember being in those days and not immediately thinking I needed my parents\u2019 help,\u201d Ms. Gonz\u00e1lez said to Ms. Bro, recalling the week after the shooting. \u201cIt just was not our first instinct to get help from anybody except for ourselves.\u201d\nThen, the students were galvanized by the friends they had just lost, and they were desperate to prevent more massacres. Six months later, they have a vastly broader view of the problems they want to fix, and a vastly longer list of people to fix them for.\nMs. Corin leapt in the day after the shooting because she had been on a dance team with one of the victims, Jaime Guttenberg. But now, she said, when she struggles to keep up the pace, she thinks of Philando Castile, too, and Michael Brown. She thinks of the young woman in Oakland who lost so many friends. \n\u201cThis movement was started because of those 17, but it\u2019s become so much more than that,\u201d Ms. Corin said. \u201cEvery single place we go, I take those people\u2019s stories, their stories of loss and pain, and I carry them with me. And every single person that has died, I do it for them now.\u201d", "date": "Aug. 15, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/15/us/politics/parkland-students-voting.html", "tags": "us \u2018 let road childhood \u201d ms. gun one activists parkland students \u2014 said"}
