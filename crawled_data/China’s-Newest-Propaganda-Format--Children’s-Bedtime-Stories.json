{"title": "China\u2019s Newest Propaganda Format: Children\u2019s Bedtime Stories", "content": "HONG KONG \u2014 Sometimes \u201cGoodnight Moon\u201d just won\u2019t do the trick.\nSo for parents struggling to get their little ones to rest their eyes for the night, China\u2019s state propaganda apparatus has a suggestion: Tell your child about President Xi Jinping\u2019s ambitions to extend China\u2019s political and economic power across Asia and the Middle East.\nChina Daily, a state-controlled media organization that aims primarily at an international audience, began releasing English-language videos this week describing a huge spending and infrastructure push called the Belt and Road Initiative, in the form of a child\u2019s bedtime story. In the two videos released so far, a father uses a windup camel skittering across a map to describe trade across Asia along the old Silk Road, and how China plans to help develop the regions it once passed through.\nMr. Xi\u2019s name is, of course, dropped prominently.\n\u201cThey\u2019re building new things like highways and railways and airports, and even pipeline and internet cables,\u201d says a father trying to put his daughter to bed.\n\u201cSo it\u2019s just about moving stuff around?\u201d she asks.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a big part of it,\u201d he says. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot more.\u201d\nIn a second video, the father expands on that point. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about roads and rail and airports to move stuff,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s also about people and cooperation.\u201d\nAny country can join, the father says. \u201cBut,\u201d he notes, \u201cthe United States hasn\u2019t joined the initiative.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s China\u2019s idea,\u201d he says, \u201cbut it belongs to the world.\u201d\nThe video identifies the father as Erik Nilsson, who is listed on LinkedIn as assistant director, features at China Daily. He did not respond to calls and an email requesting comment. An editor at China Daily\u2019s new media desk declined to immediately answer questions.\nChina has been trying to polish its  ham-handed approach to telling its story to skeptical audiences outside its borders, just as it has at home. In a video released two years ago, for example, China\u2019s official broadcaster repackaged an important but dry story about the formulation of a new five-year economic and development plan into an animated ditty about the \u201cShisanwu.\u201d\nThen there were the foreigners who appeared in a video by the Communist Party\u2019s newspaper, People\u2019s Daily, calling Mr. Xi a great leader, a family man and a handsome fellow.\nThe Belt and Road videos were released ahead of a forum in Beijing next week dedicated to the infrastructure initiative. Mr. Xi and the leaders of countries including Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, the Philippines, Russia and Turkey plan to attend.\nIt is not clear how China\u2019s plans to help build infrastructure across the region will fare. But the benefits could be considerable for the country, which has far too many steel, glass and cement factories and is looking to find markets for that overcapacity.", "date": "May 9, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/09/business/china-propaganda-bedtime-belt-road.html", "tags": "newest propaganda xi china videos daily video format \u201d says children father bedtime stories across"}
