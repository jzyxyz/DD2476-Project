{"title": "The Republican Majority Is Dead And Obamacare Is Alive", "content": "Republicans fought the health care law and the health care law won. \nIt was a close call, closer perhaps than many people realized. Had Republicans kept control of Congress in this year\u2019s midterm elections, they would almost certainly have made another attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act. If anything, the result might have emboldened them, by convincing them that they could survive the kind of political backlash that their failed 2017 effort produced.\nBut as of Tuesday evening, Republicans were set to lose their majority in the House of Representatives, with only the size of a new Democratic majority in question. And health care was a big reason why Republicans performed as badly as they did. \nThis was an election about immigration and the environment, Brett Kavanaugh and Donald Trump, but voters consistently told pollsters that health care was foremost on their minds.\u00a0\nAnd it was the GOP\u2019s repeal effort specifically that ended up causing the party so many problems, in no small part because Democrats did everything they could to make it an issue. In district after district, state after state, Republicans came under withering attack for trying to take away Medicaid and, especially, for trying to take away protections for people with pre-existing conditions. \nRepublicans tried to change the subject and, when that wouldn\u2019t work, they decided their best strategy was to lie \u2015 to pretend they hadn\u2019t spent eight years trying to strip away those pre-existing condition protections and the rest of the Affordable Care Act with it. \nThose arguments may have helped some Republican Senate candidates win close races. But they didn\u2019t save the GOP\u2019s House majority, which means the health care law has all but surely survived yet another near-death experience \u2015 the latest in a string of trials that includes the Democrats losing their filibuster-proof Senate majority in 2010, a pair of Supreme Court cases in 2012 and 2015, the failed launch of the online insurance markets in 2013, and most recently the GOP repeal effort of 2017.\nIn fact, the most immediate, practical consequence of the election could be something quite the opposite of repeal. A few hundred thousand more people could get health insurance through Medicaid, because states that had resisted the Affordable Care Act\u2019s expansion of the program could finally be joining.\nBallot initiatives to expand the program, as 33 states plus the District of Columbia have already done, won in Idaho, Nebraska and Utah Tuesday. A measure to renew an existing expansion program in another conservative state, Montana, failed.\nMedicaid expansion could also come to one other traditionally conservative state, Kansas. The state legislature approved legislation to expand the program last year,\u00a0only to have then-Gov. Sam Brownback (R)\u00a0veto it.\nOn Tuesday, Republican Kris Kobach lost his gubernatorial bid to Democrat Laura Kelly. She has pledged to approve an expansion bill within her first year of office.\nDespite these results, nobody familiar with the history of the 2010 law, or health care policy more generally, would assume that fights over the program are over \u2015 or that it is sure to be standing a few years from now. \nA lawsuit from 20 Republican state officials claiming that the law is unconstitutional now sits before a federal judge in Texas. The merits of the case are weak, as even longtime Affordable Care Act critics concede. But it\u2019s entirely possible it will prevail, setting up future appeals and perhaps injecting yet more chaos into insurance markets, because the judge is a conservative Republican appointee and the lawsuit has the backing of Trump\u2019s Justice Department. \nIt\u2019s an unusual move. Typically the Justice Department would defend a federal law, even if the administration in power doesn\u2019t like it. \nBut the decision to join was just one example of the ways the Trump administration has found to use executive authority to undermine the law, something it will continue to do as long as it controls the executive branch. While the state officials are seeking to get the entire law thrown out, Attorney General Jeff Sessions asked the judge to only invalidate the provisions of the law protecting people with pre-existing conditions.\nJust last month, the Trump administration announced it would be proposing new regulations that would give states leeway to rewrite the rules of their own insurance markets, by scaling back the regulations on pre-existing conditions and even allocating financial assistance differently. This was the administration\u2019s latest move to weaken the Affordable Care Act\u2019s consumer protections. Trump\u2019s government also severely cut back on health insurance exchange outreach and enrollment programs.\nThe Trump administration and Republican-led states will be able to continue such efforts and to impose restrictions on Medicaid eligibility. The administration already has approved plans in Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, New Hampshire and Wisconsin that impose work requirements on some adult Medicaid beneficiaries (although a court struck down Kentucky\u2019s plan). Nine other states have applied for work requirements the administration is almost certain to okay.\nThe reality is that Republicans will never stop trying to weaken, undermine and ultimately eliminate the Affordable Care Act, just as they have never given up on trying to privatize Medicare and dramatically cut Medicaid.\nBut the Medicare example is instructive, because it shows what happens when a program has become too popular to dislodge. Republicans portray themselves as defenders of Medicare, even as they are trying to scale back and transform it into a private program, because they know that a frontal, unambiguous political assault would invite such a strong popular backlash. \nThis election may signal that the Affordable Care Act has reached the same threshold or is at least getting a lot closer. The program still isn\u2019t as popular, with polls showing that only small majorities have favorable views of it, but that\u2019s an improvement over what the same polls showed just two years ago. \nIt may be that by trying to repeal the health care law, the law\u2019s critics have done what it never could do on its own: shore up support not just for the law\u2019s specific provisions, but for the very idea that people should get health care even if they are sick and even if they can\u2019t pay for that care on their own.\nNot that the Affordable Care Act has actually realized that goal. The number of people without health insurance is at historic lows, but many millions still have no coverage and even among those with insurance, many millions are struggling to pay their bills.\nSome are in trouble because they make too much money to qualify for financial assistance and the comprehensive insurance sold under Affordable Care Act regulations, with its guarantees of benefits for all, is too expensive for them to afford on their own.\nOthers are in trouble because they have employer-sponsored coverage and the out-of-pocket costs keep getting higher. This isn\u2019t a problem that Obamacare created so much as one it didn\u2019t solve: Health care still costs more in America than it does in any other country.\nNow that Democrats control congressional committees, one of their main focuses will be using subpoena power to oversee, and investigate, how the Trump administration is managing federal health programs. \nLikely topics for investigation include the Trump administration\u2019s decisions to cut that outreach spending; to allow states so much leeway in rewriting their insurance market rules; and to grant requests for work requirements and other limitations on Medicaid coverage. Some of these choices involved questionable uses of executive authority and that is precisely the sort of thing Democratic congressional committees would want to scrutinize.\nBut there\u2019s a presidential election coming in two years and, at least within the Democratic Party, this campaign is likely to feature a conversation that started in the last one \u2015 when Bernie Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont, made his proposal for a single-payer, \u201cMedicare for All\u201d system a centerpiece of his 2016 presidential campaign. \nSince that time, more than a dozen Democratic senators, including many presidential hopefuls, have endorsed the idea. Some of them have joined colleagues in promoting alternative plans that also envision large expansions of government-run insurance, along with government control over health care prices, but would not change the system as radically as would the Sanders plan.\nThe common element in these ideas is an effort to complete the party\u2019s work, from enactment of Medicare up through the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, to make sure everybody can get health care. \nWhether they settle eventually on something that could be called Medicare for All or opt for a more modest approach that includes some mix of more subsidies, government control over prices and new government-run insurance programs, a Democratic House\u00a0could be the proving ground for these ideas and the place where the party will have to coalesce about what to do next.\nRepublicans will be part of this debate, too. During the final weeks of the 2018 campaign, Republicans tried to make Medicare for All a big issue \u2015 insisting that all Democrats supported it and then insisting it would destroy American health care, and Medicare itself in particular. Those attacks might resonate more in the coming months or coming years. They might not. \nEither way, they don\u2019t give Republicans what they have always lacked and apparently still lack: a conservative health care plan that would result in health care for more people, not fewer. And the American public seems to grasp that, even though health care is such an infamously confusing subject. \nIt goes a long way to explaining why Trump and his Republicans aren\u2019t claiming victory after Tuesday night, and why millions of people who have gotten health care through the Affordable Care Act will get to keep it \u2015 at least for now.\nThis article has been updated to reflect the final result of a ballot initiative in Montana to retain the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion.\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this article misidentified the Kansas governor as Kris Kobach, who is Kansas secretary of state and was running for governor for the first time. It was Gov. Sam Brownback who vetoed Medicaid expansion.", "date": "\n11/07/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/democrats-congress-obamacare-win-midterms_n_5bdc9b23e4b04367a87c7a5b", "tags": "alive could obamacare law republicans insurance republican act affordable dead majority care health"}
