My culture plays a role in this.\u2019\u201d\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center has been\u00a0tracking white supremacist hate\u00a0for nearly three decades.\u00a0Beirich, who heads up its Intelligence Project, has been following white extremist movements since 1999, when she first started attending white supremacist meetings as part of her work.\nWhat she sees today \u2015 from an\u00a0increase in the number of hate groups, to the white supremacist movement\u2019s\u00a0emerging young leadership, to\u00a0White House staff ties to hate groups, to the continuing reluctance of many Americans to even acknowledge the problem \u2015 has her deeply concerned.\n\u201cIf somebody asked me five years ago, \u2018What do you think the future for the white supremacist movement is?\u2019 I would have said the grave,\u201d Beirich told HuffPost. \u201cI can\u2019t say that today.\u201d\nThe number of hate groups in the U.S. has doubled in the last 10 to 15 years, Beirich said during the panel discussion. Last year alone, the number of\u00a0hate groups rose\u00a0from 892 to 917, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s annual hate-tracking report, and around 80 percent of those groups advocate white supremacist or white nationalist beliefs. The number of anti-Muslim groups tripled last year.\nMembership on hate group sites has also ballooned, Beirich noted.\u00a0Leading white supremacist site Stormfront doubled its registered users during the Obama presidency to over 300,000 today.\n\u201cTheir ranks are growing,\u201d Beirich said.\nWhile it was once a hopeful sign that the most notable names in white supremacism were older people, a younger generation of leaders has emerged in the past five years. These are individuals like\u00a0Richard Spencer, the 38-year-old face of the so-called alt-right movement, an effort to rebrand the white supremacy movement and appeal to millennials and the middle class generally. They wear \u201csuits and ties and you would think are Hill staffers,\u201d Beirich said.\u00a0\nPerhaps most concerning to Beirich are the new links between the white supremacist movement and upper echelons of the federal government. \u201cPeople need to know white supremacists are in the White House,\u201d she said.\nIn particular, Beirich named President Donald Trump\u2019s chief strategist Steve Bannon, who led Breitbart News, a publisher of white nationalist content;\u00a0Trump aide Sebastian Gorka, who reportedly has ties to a Nazi-aligned group;\u00a0and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who has received awards from and\u00a0spoken at events of an anti-Muslim hate group\u00a0listed by the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve gotten awards from [hate groups]. They believe their ideas,\u201d Beirich said. \u201cThey are putting into place policy that\u2019s driven by hate groups \u2015 that has to be stopped.\u201d\nIn its first 11 weeks, the Trump administration has taken aim at Muslims with two executive orders barring travel from Muslim-majority countries\u00a0\u2015\u00a0which have been blocked by the courts \u2015\u00a0and targeted Latinos with an order to build a wall on the border with Mexico.\nSpeaking of white supremacists, Beirich said, \u201cWe\u2019d like to think these people are fringe. But the fact of the matter is the stuff on immigration and on Muslims, this is right out of the white supremacist playbook.\u201d\nWhite supremacy appears along a spectrum \u2015 from the more subtle forms of institutionalized racism such as de facto school segregation, to more overt manifestations in hate crimes. In its most extreme form, it produces domestic terrorism.\u00a0White people tend to look away from that reality, according to Beirich.\n\u201cWhite supremacists \u2015 white guys basically \u2015 commit way more domestic terrorism than radical Islam inside the U.S.,\u201d Beirich said. \u201c[Yet] there has been a general reluctance in this country to see white people as responsible for terrorism in some sort of organized way.\u201d\nBetween the 9/11 attacks in 2001 and the Orlando, Florida, nightclub shooting in 2016, for instance, more people were killed in the U.S.\u00a0by right-wing extremists than by Islamic extremists, according to a New America foundation study. There is an attempted domestic terrorism plot by white supremacists in the U.S. approximately every 34 days, Beirich said during last week\u2019s panel discussion.\u00a0\n\u201cWhen people talk about white supremacist terrorism, they want to call it a one-off, he\u2019s a crazy person. There\u2019s this list of excuses,\u201d Beirich told HuffPost. \u201cIt\u2019s like white people can\u2019t handle the idea that there are devils in our midst.\u201d\nLast month, for instance, James Harris Jackson, who is white,\u00a0murdered Timothy Caughman, who was black. He reportedly told police that he\u2019d traveled to New York City\u00a0expressly to kill black men. Some news outlets still chose to describe the killer in headlines as \u201cwell-dressed\u201d or an \u201carmy veteran\u201d (HuffPost included). Protesters that week decried him for what he is: a \u201cwhite supremacist.\u201d\nSuch double standards were also apparent when Trump, who tweets often about terror attacks, stayed publicly silent when\u00a0a white man killed six people at a Quebec City mosque.\u00a0\n\u201cWhen it\u2019s an Islamic terrorist, [it\u2019s] \u2018Muslims, clean up your backyard,\u2019\u201d Beirich said. \u201cHave you ever heard someone say to the white population that we need to root out the white male supremacists in our midst? No, we don\u2019t want to look at ourselves on this front.\u201d\nBut the history of white supremacist violence runs deep. As Beirich noted,\u00a0the Ku Klux Klan is often judged to be the first terrorist group in the U.S.\nFor white Americans who are alarmed but aren\u2019t sure what to do, Beirich suggests they begin by educating themselves about white supremacism.\u00a0Learn \u201cthe history of white supremacy in this country and its impact,\u201d and also what it advocates for: \u201ca scary, anti-democratic and racist universe.\u201d\n\u201cPeople need to know more about this movement now than they did in the past,\u201d\u00a0she said. \u201cBy not talking about white supremacy, we are not stopping its ideas \u2015 or its personnel from infecting the highest levels of power.\u201d\nJournalist Farai Chideya, who has reported on politics and white nationalism for some 25 years, echoed this idea in a recent essay, \u201cThe Call to Whiteness.\u201d\n\u201cWe as Americans have avoided the topic [of white nationalist movements] out of a mix of ignorance, fear, and aversion,\u201d Chideya wrote. \u201cI would argue we can avoid it no longer.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt remains very much up to white America to control the baser urges of the call-to-whiteness,\u201d she concluded. \u201cYou are not above it, particularly if you have not bothered to learn about it \u2014 and especially if you claim it doesn\u2019t exist or doesn\u2019t concern you.\u201d\nAnother critical way to combat extremism is to get out of your own racial, cultural, political bubble.\n\u201cGo out and meet people from other cultures. Learn about them,\u201d Beirich said, pointing\u00a0to \u201ccontact theory,\u201d or the well-researched idea\u00a0that contact with other groups can increase tolerance. \nNote that this meeting and learning works in multiple ways. White Americans need to interact with non-white Americans. Liberals would benefit from talking to conservatives, and vice versa.\u00a0\u201cEngage in civic activities that bring people together,\u201d she urged.\n\u201cI know these things sound simple and sound boring,\u201d Beirich said, \u201cbut they make a huge difference.\u201d\nConsider how taking the time to hear other people affected\u00a0former white nationalist Derek Black, whom The Washington Post profiled last year. He began to pull away from the movement after being invited to a series of Shabbat dinners by a Jewish student on his college campus.\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s how most people get out,\u201d Beirich said.\nBut she added that the work of reaching out to people\u00a0from different backgrounds or beliefs should not fall on people from marginalized groups.\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be on the groups facing this,\u201d Beirich said. \u201cIt\u2019s on the rest of us.\u201d\nFelicia Sanders, who\u00a0watched as white supremacist Dylann Roof killed her son in a Charleston, South Carolina, church in 2015, sees the same need for people to reach out to people.\n\u201cI see so many Caucasians in here \u2015 and we really don\u2019t mean you harm,\u201d said Sanders at Women in the World. \u201cThe problem is that we don\u2019t take time to know each other.\u201d\nAmericans \u2015 and white Americans in particular \u2015 also have a responsibility to make sure their government makes fighting white supremacism a priority, according to Beirich.\u00a0\n\u201cIt would be nice if everyday Americans were reminding the government \u2015 whether talking to legislators or state [and] local officials \u2015 about the importance of battling this,\u201d Beirich said. She specifically noted the importance of accurate statistics on hate crimes, which the U.S. government doesn\u2019t track in any comprehensive way.\nThe bottom line is fairly simple. As Beirich put it, we need to\u00a0\u201ctake responsibility for things screwed up in our own history.\u201d\nThe United States\u00a0does not do a good job of tracking incidents of hate and bias. We need your help to create a database of such incidents across the country, so we all know what\u2019s going on.
