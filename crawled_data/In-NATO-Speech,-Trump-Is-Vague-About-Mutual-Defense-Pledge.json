{"title": "In NATO Speech, Trump Is Vague About Mutual Defense Pledge", "content": "BRUSSELS \u2014 President Trump on Thursday punctured any illusions that he was on a fence-mending tour of Europe, declining to explicitly endorse NATO\u2019s mutual defense pledge and lashing out at fellow members for what he called their \u201cchronic underpayments\u201d to the alliance.\nOn a tense day when Mr. Trump brought the \u201cAmerica first\u201d themes of his presidential campaign to the very heart of Europe, he left European leaders visibly unsettled, with some openly lamenting divisions with the United States on trade, climate and the best way to confront Russia.\nThe discord was palpable even in body language. When Mr. Trump greeted Emmanuel Macron, France\u2019s new president, they grabbed each other\u2019s hands, jaws clenched, in an extended grip that turned Mr. Trump\u2019s knuckles white. When the leaders lined up to pose for the traditional photograph at NATO headquarters, Mr. Trump appeared to push aside the Montenegrin prime minister, Dusko Markovic, to get to his assigned place in the front.\nThe split was starkest at NATO headquarters, where Mr. Trump used the dedication of a soaring new building to lecture allies on their financial contributions. Far from robustly reaffirming NATO\u2019s mutual defense commitment in the way that many members hoped he would, Mr. Trump repeated his complaint that the United States was shouldering an unfair burden.\n\u201cTwenty-three of the 28 member nations are still not paying what they should be paying and what they\u2019re supposed to be paying for their defense,\u201d Mr. Trump declared, as the leaders shifted uncomfortably behind him, shooting one another sidelong glances.\n\u201cThis is not fair to the people and taxpayers of the United States,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd many of these nations owe massive amounts of money from past years and not paying in those past years.\u201d\nStanding before a large piece of twisted wreckage from the World Trade Center that will serve as a memorial at the headquarters, Mr. Trump promised to \u201cnever forsake the friends that stood by our side\u201d in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks \u2014 a pledge that White House officials later said was an affirmation of mutual defense.\nBut to European leaders, Mr. Trump\u2019s words fell far short of an explicit affirmation of NATO\u2019s Article 5 clause, the \u201cone-for-all, all-for-one\u201d principle that has been the foundation of the alliance since its establishment 68 years ago, after World War II.\n\u201cI think he was stingy with the U.S. commitment and very generous with his criticisms,\u201d said Fabrice Pothier, a former head of policy planning at NATO and a senior associate at Rasmussen Global, a political consulting firm.\nWhite House officials said Mr. Trump\u2019s message on financial contributions had galvanized NATO to confront the issue. At a closed meeting after his speech, they said, the leaders unanimously approved a resolution on burden-sharing and on fighting terrorism.\n\u201cTo see unanimous support for the two main priorities of the president is a great way to start it off,\u201d said Sean Spicer, the press secretary. \u201cWhen you have an entire meeting that is focused on the president\u2019s agenda, that shows the power of his message.\u201d\nPublicly, though, the other leaders appeared less gratified than bewildered. During a photo-taking session, none of them spoke to Mr. Trump, except for the secretary general of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg. Afterward, several surrounded Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who has emerged as the strongest counterweight to the president.\nEarlier in the day, Mr. Trump, a blunt critic of the European Union during his campaign, received a chilly reception from his European counterparts as they began meetings in Brussels.\nHis first meeting with the Continent\u2019s leaders began with officials from the United States and Europe saying nothing to each other. After being welcomed to Brussels, Mr. Trump said, \u201cThank you very much,\u201d but he was otherwise silent as he gazed at the cameras across the room.\nDonald Tusk, who represents leaders of the bloc\u2019s 28 member states as president of the European Council, made it clear after the morning meeting that there had been several areas of disagreement.\n\u201cSome issues remained open, like climate and trade,\u201d Mr. Tusk said after the meeting at the European Union\u2019s lavish new headquarters. \u201cAnd I am not 100 percent sure that we can say today \u2014 \u2018we\u2019 means Mr. President and myself \u2014 that we have a common position, common opinion, about Russia.\u201d\nIn the talks, Mr. Trump and Mr. Tusk differed over the intentions and policies of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, according to a person with direct knowledge of the meeting who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks were private. That reflects growing anxiety in Europe over what appear to be Russia\u2019s efforts to meddle in elections here and in the United States.\nThe subject of Russia did not come up in a broader meeting between American and European officials, said Michael Anton, a spokesman for the National Security Council. But Mr. Anton said he could not speak for a smaller meeting with Mr. Trump, Mr. Tusk and the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker.\nThe White House put a more positive spin on the day, saying the leaders had discussed ways to deepen cooperation in fighting the Islamic State and reaffirmed \u201cthe strong bond between the United States and Europe, anchored in shared values and longstanding friendship.\u201d\nClimate change is another bone of contention, however. European leaders are turning up the pressure on Mr. Trump not to withdraw from the Paris climate accord that was ratified last year.\nThe campaign began on Wednesday at the Vatican, where Pope Francis gave Mr. Trump a copy of his influential encyclical on protecting the environment, and the Vatican\u2019s secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, urged the president not to withdraw from the accord.\nMr. Trump told Vatican officials that he had not made a final decision and that he was not likely to do so until after a Group of 7 meeting this weekend in Taormina, Sicily, according to Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson. The president\u2019s senior advisers have been deadlocked for months over whether the United States should withdraw.\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada was among those who said he planned to press Mr. Trump on climate change.\n\u201cOne of the things that we understand in Canada is that investing in clean energy and investing in fighting against climate change is going to help us,\u201d Mr. Trudeau said, citing efforts by governments and businesses to find ways to avoid polluting the planet.\nMr. Trump\u2019s handling of Article 5 epitomizes the gulf between him and other leaders. His steadfast refusal to endorse it as a candidate, and later as president, has raised fears among NATO allies about whether the United States would come to their defense in the event of an attack.\nOther American officials have offered reassurances. Mr. Tillerson told reporters traveling on Air Force One this week, \u201cOf course we support Article 5.\u201d But until Mr. Trump speaks those words, leaders of other NATO nations seem bound to remain concerned.\nInstead, Mr. Trump criticized the other leaders for not contributing 2 percent of their countries\u2019 gross domestic product to their defense, as they have agreed to do but have often fallen short of. He even took a shot at the new headquarters, a vast glass-and-steel edifice that looks like a series of interconnected airplane hangars.\n\u201cI never asked once what the new NATO headquarters cost,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI refuse to do so. But it looks beautiful.\u201d\nIn 2014, NATO members agreed to increase their defense spending gradually to meet the 2 percent of G.D.P. goal, with 20 percent of that spending on military equipment. Those commitments have not changed, and after remaining flat in 2015, spending increased last year among non-American alliance members.\nThe alarm in Europe over Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency has diminished since the days immediately after his election, in part because emissaries like Mr. Tillerson and Vice President Mike Pence have reaffirmed American support for NATO and the European Union.\nBut Mr. Trump, who once described Brussels as a \u201chellhole\u201d overrun with radicals, remains an object of deep suspicion in the city. For some of the European leaders, testing Mr. Trump seemed to be as important as finding common ground with him.", "date": "May 25, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/25/world/europe/donald-trump-eu-nato.html", "tags": "european defense leaders speech nato states \u201d trump vague mutual pledge"}
