Buy Some Cereal and Condoms!", "content": "LONDON \u2014 They came from Arizona, Australia, Brighton, Seattle and Nottingham, among other places. They came because they love the royal family, because they love to eat cake and, in one case, because they had free tickets.\nEnglish literature is full of tales of disparate people thrown together for unexpected reasons. But Wednesday afternoon\u2019s gathering was hardly \u201cAnd Then There Were None.\u201d Rather, it was a 90-minute royal-wedding-and-high-tea-themed bus tour that ended up attracting a full gamut of royalists, anti-royalists and don\u2019t-care-ists who were not always altogether sure what they were doing there.\n\u201cThe bus tour idea was just a different way of having afternoon tea, while going someplace,\u201d said Sally Saunders, a high school teacher from Wollongong, Australia, who was starting on her first course, featuring mini-shepherd\u2019s pies, cucumber sandwiches and sausage rolls. \u201cThe whole point is to drive around London and eat some nice food. As for the royals \u2014 whatever.\u201d\nMuch of Britain is gripped by wedding fever \u2014 or by a fever induced by wedding fever \u2014 as it awaits the marriage on Saturday of Prince Harry, sixth in line to the throne, and Meghan Markle, who is from the United States and not in line for the throne at all. To capitalize on this singular moment, companies are rolling out new lines of royalty-related goods and services.\nThe \u201cRoyal Tea Bus Tour,\u201d sponsored by Debrett\u2019s, known for publishing a handbook to Britain\u2019s titled families, and B Bakery, a London shop specializing in tasty tea cakes, is one of these.\nBut across Britain, Meghan and Harry are everywhere.\nKeen royalists can, if they fancy, buy items from an officially approved (by Kensington Palace) line of royal-wedding-ware that includes cups, saucers, mugs and plates, along with biscuits, dishrags, Champagne and candles. They can also buy 5-pound coins issued specially by the Royal Mint.\nAnd they can buy royal wedding food and beverages: a chicken sandwich called \u201cThe Proposal,\u201d because Harry proposed while the couple was roasting a chicken; a wedding beer called \u201cThe Windsor Knot,\u201d referring to the tie-tying knot, and also to the wedding location; special wedding \u201cginger and sparkle\u201d potato chips, inspired by Harry (ginger) and Meghan (sparkle); and a Burger King wedding sandwich featuring two onion (wedding) rings.\nThere are Harry-and-Meghan sex toys, Harry-and-Meghan condoms, a royal wedding car, a royal wedding romance novel, royal wedding swimsuits and royal wedding water called \u201cStill Harry\u201d (still water) and \u201cMeghan Sparkle\u201d (sparkling water).\nMany companies say the theme has worked for them. The luxury London hotel One Aldwych, for example, reports that it has sold 37 \u201cRoyal Wedding Celebration Packages,\u201d at 345 pounds ($466) per person per night, which include breakfast, a \u201cRoyal Cup\u201d cocktail and (for \u00a345 more) a \u201cRoyal Bouquet.\u201d\nEven limited edition \u201cWedding Rings\u201d breakfast cereal, with free Harry and Meghan masks on the back of the box, had sold more than two-thirds of its full complement of 1,000 boxes as of May 3, according to politicalcereals.com, the cereal company. (Proceeds are meant to go to the homeless.)\nOn the tour bus, cupcakes with silver plastic crowns that could be made into rings once you licked off the icing, were doled out. After rolling past various regal landmarks \u2014 some palaces, Nelson\u2019s Column in Trafalgar Square \u2014 the passengers moved on to the sugar-laden portion of their tea. There were brownies and little apple treats, in honor of Meghan\u2019s American-ness, and more traditional things like scones, in honor of the fact that the bus was in England.\n\u201cThe proper pronunciation, according to etiquette, is \u2018sconn,\u2019\u201d announced Adam Adams (yes, that is his name), the historian who provided narration and color commentary for the tour.\n(\u201cTo be honest with you, it\u2019s not my bag at all,\u201d he said later, privately. \u201cI specialize in tours covering the Tudors through the Georgian period. But we all have to be very, very excited right now.\u201d)\nSome people were, in fact, genuinely excited. \u201cIt\u2019s just like Disneyland,\u201d said Katie Merritt, a 33-year-old nurse from Arizona, on the bus as part of her royal-themed vacation. She visited Windsor Castle; she visited the bakery where Harry and Meghan\u2019s cake was made; she waited two and a half hours to see the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace.\nShe\u2019s all for Harry and Meghan. \u201cCinderella has met her prince,\u201d she said. \u201cIt could be anybody. That\u2019s what\u2019s so beautiful about it.\u201d\nAt another table, Liz Tunmer and Sue Gale, both from out of town, were on the bus courtesy of Ms. Gale\u2019s son, who had given her the tickets for Christmas.\n\u201cAt the time we didn\u2019t know about the royal wedding,\u201d Ms. Gale said.\n\u201cIt was just going to be tea on a bus,\u201d Ms. Tunmer said.\nWas she a royals fan?\nIt depends. \u201cI have some friends who would rather be pulling their toenails out,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI think people see it as an excuse for a good knees-up, if you can forget we\u2019re paying for it,\u201d Ms. Gale said.\nMeanwhile, Sam and Sally Saunders, the sisters from Wollongong, were still pondering the elusive (to them) appeal of the royal family.\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s because we\u2019re Australian,\u201d Sam said.\n\u201cI just don\u2019t get it,\u201d Sally said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand their importance. I feel really terrible for saying this.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get kicked off the bus,\u201d Sam said.\n\u201cGood luck to them,\u201d Sally said. \u201cHave a nice life. I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not them.\u201d", "date": "May 17, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/17/world/europe/royal-wedding-harry-meghan.html", "tags": "meghan ride wedding bus tour royal \u201d buy cereal condoms \u2014 harry"}
