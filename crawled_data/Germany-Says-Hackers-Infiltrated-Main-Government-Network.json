{"title": "Germany Says Hackers Infiltrated Main Government Network", "content": "BERLIN \u2014 Hackers using highly sophisticated software penetrated the German government\u2019s main data network, a system that was supposed to be particularly secure and is used by the chancellor\u2019s office, ministries and the Parliament, government officials have said.\nGerman news outlets, citing security sources, have widely blamed a Russian hacking group backed by the Russian government \u2014 either one called Snake, or another known as APT28, or Fancy Bear. But Berlin has not publicly said who was behind the attack.\nThe attack was narrowly targeted, apparently seeking specific information, said Patrick Sensburg, a lawmaker with the governing Conservative Party. Officials would not say how successful the intrusion was, or what data the hackers may have taken.\nThe parliamentary committee responsible for monitoring Germany\u2019s intelligence services called a special session on Thursday, demanding information about the hacking, which was first reported on Wednesday by the German news agency D.P.A.\n\u201cWe have suffered a veritable cyberattack on parts of the government network,\u201d Armin Schuster, a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s conservative party, told reporters on Thursday.\nHe declined to give any further information, saying that the attack was continuing, as was an investigation into who might be behind it. \u201cA public discussion would serve as a warning to the attackers that we simply do not want to give them,\u201d Mr. Schuster said.\nGermany\u2019s Interior Ministry confirmed the attack on Wednesday, describing it as \u201cisolated\u201d and having been \u201cbrought under control.\u201d But the ministry would not say whether Russian hackers were responsible, and declined to give any more details.\nThe attack comes two years after German security officials determined that Fancy Bear hackers were able to breach the German Parliament\u2019s data network, leading to calls for increased security on the country\u2019s most sensitive systems.\nThe same group has been accused of breaching the computer servers of the Democratic National Committee in the United States, leading to the release of embarrassing emails during the 2016 campaign, and of targeting Olympic athletes and circulating their emails.\nGerman security officials warned in the months leading up to a national election in September that the country remained vulnerable to \u201ccyberespionage,\u201d but the country appeared to have escaped any attacks on the level of those seen during the presidential campaigns in the United States and France.\nS\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, a left-leaning German daily, reported that the country\u2019s Foreign Ministry had been among the targets of the most recent attack, citing anonymous sources within the ministry. That information, while unconfirmed, was supported by a report by Palo Alto Networks, a cyber security firm, pointing to what it called \u201ca new set of attacks\u201d by Russian hackers that appeared to be aimed at the diplomatic community in the West.\nInvestigators with Palo Alto Networks said that groups associated with Fancy Bear had used \u201cmalicious emails targeting foreign affairs agencies and ministries in North America and Europe, including a European embassy in Moscow.\u201d German media reported that the country\u2019s Defense Ministry had also been targeted.\nMr. Sensburg refused to place blame on the Russians, insisting that the authorities would need time to determine who was behind the attack.\n\u201cWhether this really was the work of this hacking collective must be carefully investigated,\u201d he told ZDF, a public broadcaster, before the parliamentary committee convened on Thursday. \u201cAs this involved the government network, which is used for communication and email traffic and a lot of daily exchanges, but does not primarily involve secret or top-secret information, it must also be carefully examined whether data has been leaked.\u201d\nUnlike the 2015 hacking attack on the German Parliament, which succeeded in breaching the system and making off with 16 gigabytes of sensitive information, Mr. Sensburg said the most recent attack appeared to be more refined, clearly targeting specific information.\nDespite attempts to play down the communication exchanged on the government network, known as the IVBB, it would be of interest for anyone seeking to spy on German intelligence. The network allows the chancellery, ministries, security services and federal auditing office to exchange information with one another. Offices in Bonn, the former West German capital, and in Berlin, are included on the specially secured network.\nEfforts to bolster Germany\u2019s data security have been a point of debate for months. The country\u2019s military is allowed to legally initiate a cyber-offensive to combat a hacking attack on its resources, but there is no such law that would permit similar defense of the country\u2019s civilian infrastructure.", "date": "March 1, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/01/world/europe/germany-hackers.html", "tags": "security country network information germany infiltrated main german hackers \u201d says attack government"}
