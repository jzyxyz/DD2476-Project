But you\u2019ve got to call it as it is,\u201d explained Dobbs. \u201cThis president said it was going to be conditional, border security, building that wall, and he just reversed himself. That\u2019s a victory for Nancy Pelosi.\u201d\n\u201cIt will be perceived as such on every television monitor and screen in the country,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd to deny it is to try to escape from reality.
