{"title": "What (if Anything) Does Carter Page Know?", "content": "They were closing in on Carter Page. It was the last day of November, and the onetime adviser to Donald Trump\u2019s campaign was dodging the tourists who clotted the sidewalks around Rockefeller Center and its famous Christmas tree. As Page wove his way through the holiday crowd, he talked about his troubles, raising his voice to be heard above a Salvation Army bell-ringer. \u201cAnybody who knows me knows how ridiculous the whole thing is,\u201d he lamented to me and everyone else within earshot along Fifth Avenue. \u201cBut you\u2019re still part of the controversy.\u201d\nPage was speaking of the investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s suspected dealings with Russia during the 2016 election, which had been gathering steam of late. About a month earlier, Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, was indicted by the Justice Department\u2019s special counsel, Robert Mueller, on charges of tax fraud and money laundering. In the next 24 hours, Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser, would plead guilty to lying to the F.B.I. Page, too, had become ensnared in the scandal, albeit more ambiguously. A foreign-policy adviser to Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, Page had had an affinity for Russia ever since studying in Moscow as a young Navy midshipman in 1991 and had worked there for three years in the 2000s. He was suspected of meeting with Russian officials during a visit to Moscow in July 2016, and shortly thereafter the F.B.I. obtained a rare warrant to monitor his electronic communications. In recent months, he has been summoned to Washington for more than 20 hours of testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee, the House Intelligence Committee and Mueller\u2019s grand jury.\nBut the fact that Page was speaking to me at all was evidence of how he differs from his castmates in the Trump-Russia soap opera. While others have lawyered up and disappeared behind a scrim of crisis-communications consultants and attorneys, Page has chosen to wage his battle almost entirely on his own, in the public spotlight. Manafort tugging on his car\u2019s sun visor to shield his face from reporters or Flynn walking stone-faced and tight-lipped into a federal courthouse might be the iconic images of the Trump-Russia scandal. But the most ubiquitous one is of Page\u2019s shorn head \u2014 his eyes bugged out and an almost blissful smile plastered across his face \u2014 bobbling above a TV news chyron on one of the numerous network and cable shows he has frequented. \u201cI genuinely hope, Carter, that you are innocent of everything, because you are doing a lot of talking,\u201d an incredulous Chris Hayes told Page when he appeared on Hayes\u2019s MSNBC show in October. \u201cIt\u2019s either admirably bold or reckless.\u201d As Page conceded to me: \u201cAdmittedly, I go beyond the level of transparency and cooperativeness any sane lawyer would advise.\u201d\nThis approach has made Page a cult figure of sorts to those who are closely tracking the ins and outs of the various Russia investigations. His TV appearances typically produce surreal sound bites, like the time he told Anderson Cooper that they once frequented the same gym. (\u201cI remember walking by you even though we didn\u2019t know each other, and I said, \u2018Hi, Anderson.\u2019\u2009\u201d) He pens verbose letters to various investigators, including one to the Justice Department claiming \u201chate crimes\u201d against him during the 2016 campaign. (\u201cThe actions by the Clinton regime and their associates may be among the most extreme examples of human rights violations observed during any election in U.S. history since Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was similarly targeted for his antiwar views in the 1960s.\u201d)\nEven when Page isn\u2019t seeking attention, he still somehow manages to find it. In November, he trooped up to Capitol Hill to deliver subpoenaed documents to the Senate and House Intelligence Committees, only to stumble into a throng of reporters staking out the office of Al Franken, who had just been accused of sexual harassment. Page was wearing a floppy red hat that made him resemble the titular castaway on \u201cGilligan\u2019s Island,\u201d prompting as many queries about his headgear as about the contents of his delivery. \u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot from the past mistakes of my fellow Annapolis grad, Senator McCain,\u201d he explained to a Business Insider reporter. \u201cSunny day in D.C., and skin cancer is one of them.\u201d\nThe more Page talks, the less clear his story has become \u2014 and people have begun to wonder about not just his competence but also his sanity. But as we walked through Manhattan that afternoon, Page assured me that he was playing a long game. \u201cHow do I say this without sounding overly confident or arrogant?\u201d he mused. \u201cNo one is better prepared to have gone through this than me.\u201d He flashed that familiar beatific smile. \u201cNot only am I ready for it,\u201d he said, \u201cI savor it.\u201d\nThe Madison Avenue offices of Page\u2019s investment firm, Global Energy Capital, are just around the corner from Trump Tower \u2014 a geographic coincidence in which Page has invested much import. \u201cFor your information, I have frequently dined in Trump Grill, had lunch in Trump Cafe, had coffee meetings in the Starbucks at Trump Tower, attended events and spent many hours in campaign headquarters on the fifth floor last year,\u201d Page wrote in a letter to the Senate Intelligence Committee in March. \u201cAs a sister skyscraper in Manhattan, my office at the IBM Building (590 Madison Avenue) is literally connected to the Trump Tower building by an atrium.\u201d Page says he has been the subject of what he calls \u201cterrorist threats\u201d for over a year and is generally skittish about revealing his haunts, but the office is an exception: \u201cIt\u2019s within the Trump Tower Secret Service zone, so it\u2019s one of the places where I feel secure,\u201d he explained in an email to me.\nBefore I visited him in November, Page told me I was the first reporter he had allowed into the office. \u201cI\u2019m sure if you Google \u2018Carter Page shadowy,\u2019 hundreds of articles come up,\u201d he boasted. \u201cI like being a shadowy figure.\u201d But when I entered the inner sanctum, I discovered that Global Energy Capital\u2019s headquarters were actually a corporate co-working space. Page, the firm\u2019s only employee, rents a windowless room \u2014 outfitted with a small circular table, a whiteboard on wheels and a painting of an orchid \u2014 by the hour. Other tenants include the National Shingles Foundation and a wedding-band company called Star Talent Inc. Still, when he mentioned Trump, Page cocked his head toward Fifth Avenue and referred to him as \u201cthe gentleman next door here.\u201d\nThe office is one of many things about Page that are less than initially meets the eye. When Trump announced Page as one of his foreign-policy advisers during a meeting with The Washington Post editorial board in March 2016, he was eager to tout Page\u2019s credentials, identifying him as \u201cCarter Page, Ph.D.\u201d Page\u2019s doctoral adviser for his degree, received in 2011 from the University of London\u2019s School of Oriental and African Studies, was Shirin Akiner, a controversial scholar who has been derided by fellow academics and human rights groups for trying to whitewash human rights abuses in Uzbekistan. But in an email, Akiner told me, \u201cI am afraid I have no information about Carter Page \u2014 some 10 years ago, he was one of my many students.\u201d\nPage tried unsuccessfully to publish his doctoral dissertation, on energy in Central Asia and Russia, as a book \u2014 a failure for which he has blamed the \u201canti-former Soviet Union, anti-Russia sentiment of various academic publishers.\u201d But one political scientist who reviewed Page\u2019s manuscript told me: \u201cIt was very analytically confused, just throwing a lot of stuff out there without any real kind of argument. I gave it a thumbs down \u2014 and that\u2019s kind of rare in this business for a review of a full book manuscript.\u201d\nBefore founding Global Energy Capital in 2008, Page spent seven years working for Merrill Lynch in London, Moscow and New York and, according to his corporate biography, was \u201cinvolved in over $25 billion of transactions in the energy-and-power sector.\u201d But his involvement appears to have been peripheral at best. In Moscow, he was nicknamed Stranichkin, from the Russian word stranichka, meaning \u201clittle page.\u201d \u201cHe wasn\u2019t great, and he wasn\u2019t terrible,\u201d Sergei Aleksashenko, who ran Merrill Lynch\u2019s Moscow office while Page worked there, told the journalist Julia Ioffe. \u201cWhat can you say about a person who in no way [is] exceptional?\u201d\nAs a midshipman at the Naval Academy, Page read and was profoundly affected by \u201cThe Wise Men,\u201d Walter Isaacson and Evan Thomas\u2019s book about Dean Acheson, Averell Harriman and the other mandarins who shaped Cold War-era foreign policy. He set out to play a similarly influential, \u201cdiscreetly backstage\u201d role in world affairs. People who encountered Page in his pre-Trump days recall him as someone who was forever struggling in that effort. Stephen Sestanovich, a professor at Columbia University\u2019s School of International and Public Affairs, remembers running into Page \u2014 who is a prodigious conference-goer \u2014 on the sidelines of various Council on Foreign Relations forums and round tables related to Russia. \u201cHis view of how the world worked seemed to have an edgy Putinist resentment to it,\u201d Sestanovich says. \u201cI think Carter genuinely felt an affinity for Putin\u2019s critique of the U.S. foreign-policy establishment and its unfairness to Russia, because he wasn\u2019t doing any better with that establishment than Putin was.\u201d In 2013, a Russian intelligence operative who was posing as a United Nations diplomat met Page at an Asia Society conference; according to the F.B.I., the Russian spy tried to recruit Page but encountered difficulties because, as he was heard telling a colleague in an F.B.I. wiretap, Page was \u201can idiot.\u201d\nIt was the Trump campaign that finally provided Page what he had been seeking for years: a seat at the table. Ed Cox, the chairman of the New York State Republican Committee and an acquaintance, secured Page a meeting in early 2016 with Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, who in turn passed off Page to Sam Clovis, a talk-show host and conservative activist in Iowa who was building out Trump\u2019s foreign-policy team. Even among Trump advisers, that team was an object of derision. \u201cTo call them D-listers would be an insult to D-listers,\u201d one former Trump adviser says. But Page didn\u2019t see it that way at all. \u201cThese were some of the best discussions I ever had, with some of the most impressive people,\u201d he recalls. \u201cIt was like an oasis.\u201d\nPage\u2019s time at the oasis would be brief. That July, he traveled to Moscow for five days to give a speech at the New Economic School. Not long after he returned, he received a text message from a Wall Street Journal reporter asking whether he met in Moscow with Igor Sechin, a Putin ally who is now chief executive of the Russian oil conglomerate Rosneft, and Igor Diveykin, a top Russian intelligence official. Similar questions from other reporters soon followed. Page told them \u2014 and still maintains \u2014 that he didn\u2019t meet either man. But in late September, Yahoo News ran an article reporting that American intelligence officials suspected that Page had met with both of them in Moscow \u2014 a claim, Page later discovered, that appeared in the dossier on Trump\u2019s suspected Russia entanglements complied by the former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele. Three days after the Yahoo report, Page announced he was taking a \u201cleave of absence\u201d as a campaign adviser.\nAfter the election, Trump\u2019s advisers continued to distance their boss from Page. When Page, returning to Moscow in December, talked to Russian reporters about Trump\u2019s victory and promoted his ties to the president-elect, the Trump campaign\u2019s lawyer, Don McGahn (now the White House counsel), sent Page a \u201ccease and desist\u201d letter. \u201cYou never met Mr. Trump, nor did you ever \u2018advise\u2019 Mr. Trump about anything,\u201d McGahn wrote. \u201cYou are thus not an \u2018adviser\u2019 to Mr. Trump in any sense of the word.\u201d In January, a week before Trump\u2019s inauguration, Stephen K. Bannon, the incoming White House chief strategist, got wind that Page was planning to appear on MSNBC and called him and told him to cancel the appearance.\n\u201cThe team is only as strong as the weakest link,\u201d Page told me. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not that I\u2019m a weak link. It\u2019s just that I\u2019m the link getting smashed with an anvil.\u201d Testifying before the House Intelligence Committee in November, he lamented, \u201cUnfortunately, I am the biggest embarrassment surrounding the campaign.\u201d\nPage hasn\u2019t always helped himself in his dealings with investigators. For more than a year, he vacillated on whether he had\nmet with any Russian government officials on that Moscow trip. But in his November testimony to the House Intelligence Committee, Page was forced to admit that he had written a memo to fellow Trump campaign advisers describing a \u201cprivate conversation\u201d during the trip with deputy prime minister Arkady Dvorkovich, who \u201cexpressed strong support for Mr. Trump and a desire to work together toward devising better solutions in response to the vast range of current international problems.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a lot that remains unexplained about Carter Page,\u201d Representative Adam Schiff of California, the committee\u2019s top Democrat, told me. \u201cBut one thing is apparent, and that is that his testimony under oath ended up being at great odds with what he had been representing publicly.\u201d\nPage continues to insist that there was nothing nefarious about any of his work for the Trump campaign. Besides, he told me, the foreign-policy team he served on was \u201ca lower-level working group, of which I was on the lower end of the lower level.\u201d And yet Page seemingly can\u2019t quite stomach the prospect of returning to the periphery, so he has crafted an alternative scandal narrative \u2014 a scandal in which he sits at the center. Page contends that the real story of the 2016 election was not collusion between Trump and Russia to defeat Hillary Clinton but rather collusion between the Democratic National Committee \u2014 which helped pay for the Steele dossier \u2014 and the F.B.I. to defeat Trump. And their efforts, Page insists, focused on him. \u201cI was the most central element, the central linchpin,\u201d he told me. Referring to his wiretapping by the F.B.I., he added: \u201cThere are two people who got hacked last year: Podesta\u201d \u2014 John Podesta, the Clinton campaign chairman, whose emails were published by WikiLeaks \u2014 \u201cand me.\u201d\nThere may be scant evidence for this theory, but rhetorically, it has allowed Page to insist on his innocence and his significance at the same time: If circumstances have conspired to keep him from being a wise man, then at least he can be a martyr. The whole affair has wrecked his business, he says, and cost him relationships. He compares himself to the oft-imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. He even likens his plight to those of women who have suffered sexual harassment or assault. \u201cTalk to some ladies you know,\u201d he told me, \u201cand ask them: \u2018What would you rather have? Someone putting their hand on your rear end or your breast momentarily? Or having to give up all of your personal communications, all of your thousands of emails and thousands of documents? Which would you prefer?\u2019 It\u2019s a powerful person putting influence on someone who\u2019s less powerful.\u201d\nIn September, Page filed a libel lawsuit against Yahoo\u2019s corporate parent and the Broadcasting Board of Governors, which operates Radio Free Europe, for their reporting about his July Moscow trip \u2014 \u201cperhaps the most dangerous, reckless, irresponsible and historically instrumental moments in modern-day sensational crime-story journalism,\u201d as the suit puts it. Page is representing himself. \u201cThe real investigation, I think, is going to be the discovery process in my lawsuit,\u201d he told me. \u201cThe information that will come out of this may be far more revealing than these other investigations.\u201d\nAnd in that, Page maintains, he will be able to achieve his most important goal: avoiding a cataclysmic conflict between the United States and Russia. He believes he is uniquely suited, perhaps even destined, to bring the two countries together. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously for myself in some ways, but the bigger motivation is to prevent the legacy of ashes, the next Iraq, the next Libya, the next Vietnam, which are all minuscule compared to the level of potential conflict between our two countries,\u201d Page told me.\nIt\u2019s a lonely struggle; Page has been forsaken by former friends and colleagues. But in Donald Trump, he believes he still has an ally. \u201cWhen he was in there with Kislyak and Lavrov in the Oval Office,\u201d Page said, referring to Trump\u2019s controversial May meeting with the Russian ambassador and foreign minister, \u201ckind of joking around and still having the courage to try to continue a vision of actually improving relations, that\u2019s a real profile in courage.\u201d", "date": "Dec. 18, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/18/magazine/what-if-anything-does-carter-page-know.html", "tags": "carter know russian \u201d one moscow anything told page \u2014 campaign"}
