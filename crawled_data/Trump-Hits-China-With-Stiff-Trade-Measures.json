{"title": "Trump Hits China With Stiff Trade Measures", "content": "President Trump put China squarely in his cross hairs on Thursday, imposing tariffs on as much as $60 billion worth of Chinese goods to combat the rising threat from a nation that the White House has called \u201can economic enemy.\u201d\nThe measures are Mr. Trump\u2019s strongest trade action yet against a country that he says is responsible for thousands of lost American jobs and billions in lost revenues. Financial markets plunged on fears of a potential trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies, with the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index dropping by 2.5 percent.\nThe White House said it was taking action in retaliation for China\u2019s use of pressure and intimidation to obtain American technology and trade secrets. The measures include a significant change in Mr. Trump\u2019s looming steel and aluminum tariffs that would aim them primarily at China.\nAfter Mr. Trump announced the moves, China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce said that it was proposing tariffs of its own on 128 products from the United States, like nuts, wine and pork, that it valued at about $3 billion. China urged the Trump administration to resolve differences through dialogue to \u201cavoid damage to the broader picture of Chinese-U.S. cooperation.\u201d\nThe president\u2019s actions fulfill his frequent campaign pledge to demand fairer trade deals with nations around the globe and to retaliate against trading partners if the United States does not secure better agreements.\n\u201cWe have one particular problem,\u201d the president said before signing an order that will impose tariffs on hundreds of Chinese products, from shoes and clothing to consumer electronics. \u201cWe have a tremendous intellectual property theft situation going on.\u201d\nThe sanctions reflect a shift in relations between the two economic giants, which for years engaged in highly structured dialogues to try to reach agreement on economic and security issues. But the White House now views those dialogues \u2014 and the agreements they produced \u2014 as largely hollow promises by the Chinese.\nRather than trying to draw China into the rules-based international economic order \u2014 a policy that dates back to Richard M. Nixon and Henry A. Kissinger \u2014 the United States now regards China as a strategic competitor, bent on eroding American security and prosperity.\nThe White House \u2014 along with many in the business community \u2014 believes the United States needs to strike back against China\u2019s exploitation of its intellectual property, even if many question whether tariffs are the best tactic.\n\u201cWe repeatedly aired our concerns about China,\u201d said Peter Navarro, director of the White House National Trade Council and a key architect of the measures. \u201cWhat the United States is doing is strategically defending itself from China\u2019s economic aggression.\u201d\nMr. Trump said that he respected China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, and that China had been helpful in pressuring North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs. But the president declared that the United States would no longer tolerate running a trade deficit of nearly $400 billion with China, its second-largest trading partner, after the European Union.\nOn Thursday, the United States trade representative issued a lengthy report outlining a pattern of predatory behavior by the Chinese, including forcing American companies to transfer valuable technology and trade secrets, and \u201csystematic\u201d data theft by China through hacking of American computer systems.\nIn addition to the tariffs, the Treasury Department will restrict Chinese investment in American technology firms \u2014 a practice that officials said China uses to nurture its own \u201cnational champions\u201d in cutting-edge industries like artificial intelligence and autonomous vehicles.\nThe administration\u2019s increasing focus on punishing China was evident in its decision to exempt allies like the European Union, South Korea, Brazil, Canada and Mexico from what were supposed to be worldwide tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. The levies, which go into effect on Friday, will largely hit China.\nFears of a trans-Pacific trade war reverberated through the world\u2019s markets, with the stock prices for major exporters like Boeing and Caterpillar plunging more than 5 percent.\nThe Chinese Embassy in the United States issued a blunt statement, saying that \u201cChina does not want a trade war with anyone. But China is not afraid of and will not recoil from a trade war. China is confident and capable of facing any challenge. If a trade war were initiated by the U.S., China would fight to the end to defend its own legitimate interests with all necessary measures.\u201d\nUnder the proposed Chinese countermeasures, American-produced fresh fruit, nuts, wine, seamless steel pipes and other goods would be hit by 15 percent tariffs, while another group of goods, including pork, would attract 25 percent tariffs.\nChina would also \u201ctake legal action within the framework of the World Trade Organization,\u201d the Chinese Commerce Ministry said.\nInside the White House, there was little of the rancorous debate that erupted before Mr. Trump announced the steel and aluminum tariffs earlier this month. The president has steadily winnowed free-trade advocates from the ranks of his cabinet, and these measures are unlikely to draw the wall of opposition from Republicans that the metal tariffs did.\nMr. Trump\u2019s announcement brought some clarity to a process that the White House has largely conducted in secret, since the president announced an investigation of China\u2019s trade practices last summer. But more will be revealed when the administration publishes the list of Chinese goods it will target for tariffs within the next 15 days.\n\u201cWe learned something today, but there\u2019s still tremendous uncertainty about what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d said Chad P. Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cSo in a sense, we didn\u2019t learn much.\u201d\nAdministration officials said they were tailoring the list to minimize price increases for consumers, who buy large quantities of goods from China, and were focusing in part on strategic industries China is attempting to build up with state support. But Mr. Bown noted that the president\u2019s target for tariffs \u2014 $60 billion \u2014 represents more than 10 percent of America\u2019s annual imports from China.\n\u201cEventually they will feed into higher consumer prices,\u201d he said.\nThe United States trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, told the Senate Finance Committee that tariffs should be levied on Chinese products from all the advanced industries it has vowed to build up as part of its \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d plan. Those include electric vehicles, high-tech shipping and aerospace technology. He called them \u201cthe ones I care about.\u201d\nBut Mr. Lighthizer and his colleague, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, faced a barrage of questions and criticism from lawmakers, several of whom worried about Chinese retaliation.\n\u201cA state like Iowa stands to lose,\u201d particularly if China targets soybean exports, said Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa. Senator Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas, said, \u201cWe\u2019re in a dire fix.\u201d\nMr. Lighthizer acknowledged those concerns. \u201cEvery time we take a trade action, agriculture is in the cross hairs,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019re very sympathetic to.\u201d\nMr. Trump\u2019s announcement was welcomed by a leading Democratic trade hawk in the Senate, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, who said the tariffs were a first step toward a comprehensive response to China that should also include increased screening of foreign investment in the United States to ensure it does not hurt American jobs.\n\u201cI applaud the president\u2019s aggressiveness in targeting tariffs on a country that is clearly cheating,\u201d Mr. Brown said.\nMr. Trump\u2019s move comes at a time when he has enlisted Mr. Xi to help pressure North Korea over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Last year, Mr. Trump said he had decided not to designate China as a currency manipulator, in part because China was cooperating in the pressure campaign. His explicit linkage of trade and security raises questions about whether the tensions from these tariffs will spill over into the North Korea issue.\n\u201cThe end objective of this is to get China to modify its unfair trade practices,\u201d Everett Eissenstat, the deputy director of the National Economic Council, said in a telephone call with reporters.", "date": "March 22, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/22/us/politics/trump-will-hit-china-with-trade-measures-as-white-house-exempts-allies-from-tariffs.html", "tags": "mr. china measures united stiff \u201d trump chinese trade hits tariffs"}
