{"title": "Drummer Defends Stanford Student Convicted in Rape Case. Her Band Pays a Price.", "content": "Good English is a small-time band from Oakwood, Ohio, three sisters with a garage rock vibe. In Brooklyn, this week, they became pariahs.\nThe women have found themselves at the center of a debate about sexual assault after a pre-sentencing letter written to a judge a few months ago by one of the sisters, Leslie Rasmussen, involving the case of a Stanford University student who was convicted of sexually assaulting an intoxicated woman, was made public. Ms. Rasmussen, in her letter, described the student, Brock Allen Turner, as a childhood friend and an elementary school classmate, and defended him.\nIn rapid succession, Good English has been dropped from several Brooklyn venues where they were scheduled to play, as well as the Northside Festival, a weeklong music festival that began on Monday. Other festivals have also announced that the band will no longer be performing.\n\u201cWhen people choose to defend something, then I think they should be held accountable for it,\u201d said Daniel Stedman, a founder of the Northside Media Group, which runs the Brooklyn festival.\nAfter Mr. Turner\u2019s sentencing last week, Mr. Stedman said he found himself moved to tears as he read the graphic courtroom statement from the woman whom Mr. Turner sexually assaulted. The statement has been widely distributed since, describing the attack and what followed.\n\u201cHow does the average person who is really upset and troubled about the Brock story, how does somebody participate in that, making right of a wrong?\u201d Mr. Stedman said. \u201cWe are really just one tiny, infinitesimal part of that puzzle, but I think it was a no-brainer for us.\u201d\nIn her letter, Ms. Rasmussen, 20, says that there was a distinction between rape and Mr. Turner\u2019s case, and suggested that alcohol was to blame for his actions.\nMr. Turner, 20, a swimmer at Stanford, was found by two passers-by, partially clothed behind a trash bin on campus, on top of the 23-year-old woman, who was incapacitated by alcohol, according to the authorities. The passers-by stopped the assault and held Mr. Turner down as he tried to flee.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to base the fate of the next ten + years of his life on the decision of a girl who doesn\u2019t remember anything but the amount she drank to press charges against him,\u201d Ms. Rasmussen, who plays drums in the band, wrote. \u201cBut where do we draw the line and stop worrying about being politically correct every second of the day and see that rape on campus isn\u2019t always because people are rapists.\u201d\nMr. Turner was convicted of three counts of felony sexual assault for the attack, which took place in January 2015. This week the judge in the case, Aaron Persky of Superior Court in Santa Clara County, Calif., came under withering criticism from the public for the sentence he imposed: six months in jail and probation.\nMs. Rasmussen\u2019s letter was part of a package of letters sent to the judge on behalf of Mr. Turner before his sentencing, a standard practice in which people seek to influence a sentencing decision by sharing their experiences of the defendant. His father also sent a letter that had an even more explosive effect when it was made public this week; he said that the episode had affected his son\u2019s appetite and that, in particular, he no longer enjoyed rib-eye steaks.\nFollowing the firestorm her letter provoked, Ms. Rasmussen said that her words were being twisted and that she was being unfairly stigmatized. \u201cThis appeal has now provided an opportunity for people to misconstrue my ideas into a distortion that suggests I sympathize with sex offenses and those who commit them or that I blame the victim involved,\u201d she said in a statement.\nMs. Rasmussen also believed that the letter to the judge was private. But a spokesman for the court said she was wrong \u2014 such letters, like most documents entered into the court, are a matter of public record.\nWithin hours of Ms. Rasmussen\u2019s letter being made public by New York magazine, Good English was removed from a roster of Brooklyn venues where they were scheduled to perform in the coming days, including Rock Shop in Gowanus, Industry City Distillery in Greenwood, Gold Sounds in Bushwick, and Bar Matchless in Greenpoint.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be affiliated with anyone that\u2019s going to try to victim-blame or even just downplay rape,\u201d said Larry Hyland, an owner of Bar Matchless.\nMr. Hyland said he had received over 50 emails and posts on the bar\u2019s Facebook page demanding that the band\u2019s show be canceled. Some of the messages, he said, included threats to confront the band members if they did perform.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t cancel the show because of censorship,\u201d he said, adding that while he disagreed with the content of Ms. Rasmussen\u2019s letter, he understood the impulse to want to help a childhood friend. \u201cI wanted to avoid an unsafe environment.\u201d\nOn Tuesday, the Dayton Music Art and Film Festival near the band\u2019s hometown announced that it, too, was removing the band from its September lineup. \u201cSuch actions should not be defended, friend or not,\u201d the festival wrote on its Facebook page. On Wednesday, Behind the Curtains Media, the public relations firm that represented Good English, dropped them from its client roster.\nIn her statement, Ms. Rasmussen attributed the fallout from her initial letter not to what she wrote, but to \u201cthe overzealous nature of social media.\u201d In particular, she lamented the \u201cuproar of judgment and hatred unleashed on me\u201d and the effect it was having on her musical aspirations.", "date": "June 8, 2016", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/09/nyregion/drummer-defends-stanford-student-convicted-in-rape-case-her-band-pays-a-price.html", "tags": "convicted band letter public rape stanford pays drummer rasmussen \u201d defends price turner student ms. case"}
