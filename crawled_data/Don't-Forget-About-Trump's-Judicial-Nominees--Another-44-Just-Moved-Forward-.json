{"title": "Don't Forget About Trump's Judicial Nominees- Another 44 Just Moved Forward-", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2015 It\u2019s hard to keep up with everything going on in Washington, but if there\u2019s one thing constantly humming along in the background, it\u2019s the Republican effort to push through President Donald Trump\u2019s judicial nominees.\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee voted Thursday to send 44 of Trump\u2019s court picks to the Senate floor for a confirmation vote. That\u2019s a huge number at once; progressive judicial advocacy groups dubbed the committee\u2019s hearing a \u201cmonster markup.\u201d\nMost of these nominees were introduced in the last Congress but didn\u2019t get confirmed in time, so Republicans are expediting them in one big batch.\nThursday\u2019s action comes as Trump has already drastically reshaped federal courts. To date, he has seen 30 circuit judges, 53 district judges and two Supreme Court justices confirmed. That\u2019s so many circuit judges \u2015 more than any other president had confirmed by this point in his first term \u2015 that 1 in 6 seats on the U.S. circuit courts are now filled by judges nominated by Trump.\nBut Democrats and progressive groups aren\u2019t just alarmed by the number of Trump\u2019s picks sailing through. Many of these nominees have spent their careers attacking LGBTQ rights, abortion rights and voting rights, and now they\u2019re on their way to holding lifetime seats on federal courts.\nAs Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) pointed out in Thursday\u2019s hearing, more than 80 percent of Trump\u2019s judicial nominees so far are members of the conservative Federalist Society. For some context, she noted that less than 4 percent of all American lawyers are members of that group.\n\u201cMonth after month, we have seen a parade of these so-called conservative activists nominated to the federal courts,\u201d Hirono said. \u201cThey have been groomed by conservative political ideologues. They want to see Roe v. Wade overturned or narrowed into oblivion, LGBT people permanently consigned to the margins of American life, and constitutional and civil rights encroached [based] on the religious preference of a vocal few.\u201d\nThis story would be pages long if we spelled out the records of all of the controversial nominees who just advanced, so here\u2019s a sampling of the people drawing some of the fiercest criticism from civil and women\u2019s rights groups. All of these nominees are likely to be confirmed given Republicans\u2019 majority in the Senate.\nThe 37-year-old attorney was a legal intern at the Alliance Defending Freedom, which the Southern Poverty Law Center has\u00a0classified as a \u201chate group,\u201d and mentored people through the organization\u2019s controversial Blackstone Legal Fellowship program.\nAs reported by Rewire in 2013, the Blackstone program focuses on \u201cfighting for the criminalization of abortion; against the rights of LGBT people; for so-called religious liberty (which often comes in the form of defending clients who wish to discriminate against gay people based on their religious beliefs); and for organized Christian prayer in government or public school settings.\u201d\nRushing also\u00a0argued in a 2013 panel discussion that there were \u201cboth moral and practical\u201d reasons for creating the Defense of Marriage Act, the former federal law that banned same-sex marriage. She frequently referenced the late Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s dissent from the Supreme Court\u2019s 2013 decision striking down part of DOMA that said it departed from \u201ctraditional\u201d concepts of marriage and morality.\nThe 43-year-old attorney has built a career out of fighting tribal interests and sovereignty, so much so that one Native American leader described Miller\u2019s law firm, Perkins Coie, as the go-to destination for jurisdictions that want \u201cto fight an Indian tribe.\u201d\nTwo prominent Native American organizations \u2015 the National Congress of American Indians and the Native American Rights Fund \u2015\u00a0wrote to Judiciary Committee leaders\u00a0in August citing problems with Miller.\n\u201cOur concern is that he chose to build a law practice on mounting repeated challenges to tribal sovereignty, lands, religious freedom, and the core attribute of federal recognition of tribal existence,\u201d the letter says.\u00a0\u201cHis advocacy has focused on undermining the rights of Indian tribes, often taking extreme positions and using pejorative language to denigrate tribal rights.\u201d\nTheir opposition to Miller is only the third time either group has opposed a federal judicial nominee.\nThe 42-year-old lawyer\u00a0wrote approvingly in a 2015 op-ed that \u201cthe Catechism holds that \u2018homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered,\u2019 \u2018contrary to the natural law,\u2019 and \u2018do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity.\u2019\u201d\nIn the fall of 2015, Kacsmaryk criticized the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in favor of marriage equality, saying that the justices who ruled for it \u201cfound an unwritten \u2018fundamental right\u2019\u201d hidden in the Constitution \u201cso cleverly concealed ... that it took almost 150 years to find.\u201d\u00a0\nOn abortion matters,\u00a0Kacsmaryk fought to give pharmacists the right to deny emergency contraceptives to women. In a 2016 amicus brief filed with the Supreme Court, he wrote that a Washington state law requiring pharmacists either to fill a medical prescription or find an available pharmacist who will, which had been upheld by the 9th Circuit, \u201cauthorizes an unprecedented and dangerous intrusion on the most basic right of conscience.\u201d The Supreme Court let the 9th Circuit decision stand.\nThe 58-year-old attorney is a vocal opponent of abortion rights\u00a0who initially didn\u2019t tell senators about her extreme comments on the topic.\n\u201cPlanned Parenthood says they promote women\u2019s health,\u201d Vitter said in a May 2013 speech she gave in protest of a new clinic in New Orleans. \u201cIt is the saddest of ironies that they kill over 150,000 females a year. The first step in promoting women\u2019s health is to let them live.\u201d\nAhead of her 2018 confirmation hearing, Vitter, whose husband is former Sen. David Vitter (R-La.), did not disclose to the committee that she had\u00a0moderated a panel at a 2013 anti-abortion conference\u00a0peddling false information about the dangers of abortion \u2015 or that she urged audience members to tell their doctors to put materials in their waiting rooms claiming that abortions cause breast cancer, which is not true. Vice News later\u00a0uncovered these missing materials.\nThe 51-year-old lawyer\u00a0fought for California\u2019s short-lived ban on same-sex marriage, Proposition 8, before it was overturned by the Supreme Court in 2013.\nDuring the case, Nielson argued that sexual orientation is a choice and disputed the harmful effects\u00a0of discrimination on LGBTQ people. When a U.S. district court ruled in 2010 that Prop 8 violated the Constitution, Nielson argued that then-Chief Judge Vaughn Walker should have recused himself from the case because he was gay and therefore, Nielson claimed, unable to be fair on the issue.\u00a0He\u00a0filed a motion\u00a0contending that Walker \u201chad a duty to disclose not only the facts concerning his [same-sex] relationship, but also his marriage intentions.\u201d That\u00a0motion was denied by another judge.\nNielson also defended a former Justice Department colleague who wrote a controversial and now-rescinded memo authorizing the CIA\u2019s use of torture.\nThe 37-year-old Oklahoma Supreme Court justice made limiting reproductive rights a top priority when he previously served as state solicitor general. In one case, he\u00a0defended a law\u00a0that would have required minors to obtain a prescription before buying emergency contraception. The law would have also forced adult women to prove their age before purchasing such contraception. The legislation was\u00a0permanently blocked\u00a0by a state judge in 2014.\u00a0\nWyrick filed an\u00a0amicus brief\u00a0in the landmark 2014 Hobby Lobby case, in which the Supreme Court ruled that closely held corporations are in some circumstances exempt from regulations their owners object to on religious grounds \u2014 specifically, the contraceptive coverage mandate of the Affordable Care Act. In his brief, Wyrick argued that the mandate was unconstitutional because \u201creligious faith is more than mere belief. It is practice.\u201d\nHe also worked closely with then-Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt to challenge environmental protections\u00a0in order to help the oil and gas industry.", "date": "\n02/07/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-judicial-nominees-lgbtq-abortion-voting-rights_n_5c5c97d6e4b0e01e32aa8edf", "tags": "judicial court rights forward- \u201d trump supreme \u2015 federal another forget nominees law moved nominees-"}
