{"title": "Trump\u2019s Trade War Escalation Will Exact Economic Pain, Adviser Says", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser said on Sunday that American consumers would bear some pain from the escalating trade war with China, contradicting Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that his tariffs are a multibillion-dollar, mostly one-way payment by China to the American Treasury.\nThe comments from Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, came after the 11th round of trade negotiations broke off without a deal, prompting Mr. Trump to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese products and begin a process to impose levies on nearly every product China exports to the United States.\n\u201cIn fact, both sides will pay,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cBoth sides will suffer on this.\u201d\nMr. Kudlow\u2019s acknowledgment of economic pain, while widely shared by economists, contradicted the president\u2019s view that trade wars are easy to win and that the burden falls disproportionately on America\u2019s trading partners. Mr. Trump again asserted on Monday that there was \u201cno reason\u201d that American consumers would pay the tariffs.\nBoth Mr. Kudlow and the president say that a protracted trade war will ultimately be in the United States\u2019 financial interest. Mr. Kudlow said that any pain would be worth the price if it forced China to treat American companies more fairly.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to do what you got to do,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said. \u201cWe have had unfair trading practices all these years and so in my judgment, the economic consequences are so small that the possible improvement in trade and exports and open markets for the United States, this is worthwhile doing.\u201d\nFinancial markets reflected the potential for pain. Asian and European stocks were mostly lower early on Monday, and futures markets suggested Wall Street would open down, too.\nNegotiations between the countries broke down last week after administration officials accused the Chinese of backtracking on several key provisions of a proposed deal, including agreeing to codify changes in Chinese law. Administration officials insist the talks have been constructive, and say they will continue; Mr. Kudlow said that could possibly include a meeting next month between Mr. Trump and President Xi Jinping of China at the Group of 20 summit meeting in Osaka, Japan. But Mr. Trump has muddied that message with tweets suggesting he would be happy to leave tariffs in place indefinitely.\nMr. Trump\u2019s confidence in the strength of the American economy is fueling his decision to escalate the trade fight. But it is an economic gamble, one that could inflict lasting damage depending on how far Mr. Trump is willing to take his battle and what it produces in the end.\nIn a tweet on Sunday, Mr. Trump said the United States was \u201cright where we want to be with China,\u201d adding that the United States \u201cwill be taking in Tens of Billions of Dollars in Tariffs from China.\u201d\nEconomists differ on how much the trade war will crimp economic growth, but most agree that the cost of tariffs is passed on to businesses or consumers in the form of higher prices on everything, including lighting fixtures and art supplies. Among the items covered by the administration\u2019s latest increase in tariffs to 25 percent: computers, toilet paper, dog collars, Christmas tree lights and mattress supports.\nThe new tariff will not knock the American economy into recession, forecasters say, but it will hurt economic growth \u2014 and could do so drastically \u2014 if Mr. Trump follows through with his plan to place the tariff on all imports from China.\nThe United States imported $540 billion worth of goods from China in 2018, according to government statistics.\n\u201cTrump is dragging a dangerous misconception into a critical moment in his standoff with the Chinese,\u201d Chad Bown, an expert on trade at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said last week. \u201cAnd American businesses and consumers stand to pay the price.\u201d\nTariffs enacted last year reduced the inflation-adjusted income of American consumers by $4.4 billion each month by November, according to one study. That loss, which arose both from the tariff and from more expensive or foregone imports, breaks out to about $419 per household over a year. The latest round of increases will push the per-household cost above $800, said David Weinstein, a Columbia University economist and a co-author on the research.\nMr. Trump and his advisers insist his approach will ultimately pay off for the American economy \u2014 either by prodding China to open its markets and treat American firms more fairly, or by encouraging companies to shift manufacturing to the United States to avoid tariffs.\nBut the decision to prolong the trade war could upend economic projections that showed robust hiring, growth and investment this year, in part because of fading concerns about a protracted trade fight. And it could defy steady predictions by administration economists that Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policy will help increase growth in 2019 to 3.2 percent \u2014 well above what most other forecasters expect.\n\u201cThere is absolutely no question that these tariffs, if imposed and sustained, increase the probability of a recession,\u201d Rob Martin, a former Fed section chief who is now an executive director at UBS, said of a potential escalation. \u201cIt makes you more vulnerable.\u201d\nMr. Martin and his colleagues estimate that Mr. Trump\u2019s latest increase could shave 0.25 to 0.35 percentage points off gross domestic product over six months. If the remainder of China\u2019s products get hit with a 25 percent tariff, it could shave up to another full percentage point from G.D.P.\n\u201cIf we move into that next tranche of tariffs, we\u2019re in 100 percent uncharted territory,\u201d Mr. Martin said. The products in that category are about two-thirds consumer goods and for many \u2014 which could include toys, bicycles and iPhones \u2014 it could be hard to find quick substitutes.\nA prolonged trade war could inflict damage on China\u2019s economy. Economic growth in China slowed in the second half of last year, in part because tariffs hurt business confidence. Since then, the Chinese government has poured billions of dollars into the financial system and pressed state-run banks into service extending credit.\nOfficials said last month that the economy grew 6.4 percent in the first quarter of the year, matching the pace from the previous quarter.\nBut Mr. Trump is clearly banking on a protracted fight to shift the economic calculus, warning China in a tweet that \u201ca deal will become far worse for them if it has to be negotiated in my second term.\u201d\nWhile Mr. Trump is confident in his approach, his decision to add new trade barriers with China \u2014 in the form of higher tariffs \u2014 has confounded analysts and some business groups that have otherwise praised his handling of the economy.\nAnalysts at the Tax Foundation, a Washington think tank that forecast a large increase to economic growth from the tax cuts Mr. Trump signed in 2017, now say that the tariffs the president has put in place or threatened \u2014 and the effects of Chinese retaliatory tariffs on American exporters \u2014 would more than cancel out all the economic benefits of the tax law.\n\u201cThe tariffs, if allowed to continue, will mute the economic benefits of tax reform,\u201d said Nicole M. Kaeding, a Tax Foundation economist \u2014 particularly for low- and middle-income consumers who will be stuck paying higher prices. \u201cEconomists argue about many things, but the impact of tariffs on the economy is not debated. They are harmful.\u201d\nMany of those groups say growth would be even stronger this year if Mr. Trump had reached a deal with China and averted a prolonged government shutdown. They blame Mr. Trump\u2019s fundamental misunderstanding of tariffs \u2014 which he believes are lifting the economy \u2014 for driving the country into a danger zone.\nAnalysts at Goldman Sachs said in a research note that further escalation of the trade war could reduce growth by nearly half a percentage point this year, and that \u201cif trade tensions sparked a major sell-off in the equity market, the growth impact could worsen considerably.\u201d\nStocks swooned last week but had begun to rebound by Friday afternoon. Financial conditions have tightened, but remain well below levels seen late last year.\n\u201cSo far, U.S. markets don\u2019t express a lot of concern \u2014 I think everybody expects a deal,\u201d said Roberto Perli, an economist at Cornerstone Macro. \u201cThe risk is that time passes, nothing happens and the market realizes \u2014 maybe we were too optimistic.\u201d\nMr. Trump has expressed satisfaction with \u201cbig beautiful tariffs\u201d that he said were producing \u201cbillions of dollars\u201d for America.\n\u201cI am very happy with over $100 Billion a year in Tariffs filling U.S. coffers\u2026great for U.S., not good for China,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Twitter last week.\nOf the $419-per-household cost of last year\u2019s tariffs, most of the hit \u2014 $286 \u2014 came from the levy itself. Because the American government collected that money, it was able to redistribute it, including through a $12 billion program of farm subsidies. But that could change as the trade war persists.\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty likely that the tariff revenue is going to fall,\u201d Mr. Weinstein of Columbia University said, as firms find themselves unable to shoulder the higher rates and stop importing from China. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see a lot of supply chains shifting around.\u201d\nThat means Chinese companies will also lose out as businesses buy more American-made goods or continue turning to other low-cost producers outside China, like Vietnam and Malaysia.\nMr. Trump\u2019s shift on tariffs appears to have surprised Fed officials, who had been expecting the trade dispute to calm down. This month, the Fed chairman, Jerome H. Powell, told reporters at a news conference that risks to growth from trade policy had \u201cmoderated somewhat,\u201d citing \u201creports of progress in the trade talks between the United States and China.\u201d\nIt is unlikely that Mr. Powell and his colleagues will react quickly to the higher tariffs and renewed trade war. The Fed will most likely judge any inflation that comes from trade policy as temporary, and may want to see economic growth weakening before acting on it through a rate cut or other measures.\n\u201cThe Fed is unlikely to act immediately, in part because it is unclear whether this drama will end in a deal, an all-out trade war or something in between,\u201d said Krishna Guha, head of the Global Policy and Central Bank Strategy team at advisory firm Evercore ISI.\nIf the central bank does react, it is more likely that it would cut rates to offset the economic pain. Raphael Bostic, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said at a National Association for Business Economics conference last week that the tariff increase could prompt a rate cut if higher costs cause consumers to pull back, \u201cdepending on the severity of the response.\u201d\nMr. Guha concurred, saying that the Fed would not hesitate to react if there were signs of a real risk to economic growth. Instead, it will most likely \u201ccut rates on insurance grounds, in particular given weak inflation.\u201d", "date": "May 12, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/12/us/politics/trump-us-china-economy.html", "tags": "adviser \u201c china exact trump war economic escalation trade pain says tariffs \u2014"}
