AfD is also eyeing the May 2019 European Parliament elections.\nLast week an AfD office in the eastern town of D\u00f6beln was damaged by an explosion. No-one was hurt.\nSPD leader Andrea Nahles said that AfD was a \"political opponent\" of Germany's tolerant society but anyone trying to fight it with violence \"betrays these values and jeopardises our co-existence\".", "date": "8 January 2019", "href": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-46792556", "tags": "bremen hospital badly frank germany mp german afd hurt three year leader magnitz attack far-right"}
