{"title": "India 'beef' lynching: PM Modi breaks silence", "content": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has broken his silence over the mob killing of a Muslim man rumoured to have eaten beef.\nHindus and Muslims should fight poverty and not each other, he told a campaign rally in Bihar.\nMr Modi had been under pressure to condemn the killing of Mohammad Akhlaq, who was beaten to death last month.\nHindus consider cows sacred and slaughtering the animals is banned in many states.\nMr Modi's government wants a nationwide ban, but beef is consumed by Muslims and other religious minorities in India.\nThe prime minister said Indians should ignore \"irresponsible\" statements by politicians - including ones made by himself - and work together.\n\"Hindus should decide whether to fight Muslims or poverty. Muslims have to decide whether to fight Hindus or poverty.\n\"Both need to fight poverty together.... The country has to stay united,\" he said.\nBut his comments come on the same day that members of Mr Modi's BJP party beat a Muslim politician in the Kashmir state assembly after he served beef at a private party.\nThe politician - Rashid Ahmed - said he did it in protest against a ban on serving beef in the state.\nOpposition leader Omar Abdullah led a walkout, asking afterwards: \"Do I assault everyone who eats pork or alcohol?\"\nBJP Deputy Chief Minister Nirmal Singh said he did not approve of the attack but said that serving beef was \"also wrong\".\nMohammad Akhlaq died after being kicked and beaten with stones by a group of men in Dadri in Uttar Pradesh state late in September. His son was seriously injured.\nSix people have been arrested in connection with the incident.", "date": "8 October 2015", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-34477875", "tags": "minister india poverty silence muslims breaks hindus modi state pm lynching fight beef"}
