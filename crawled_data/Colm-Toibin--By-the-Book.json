{"title": "Colm Toibin: By the Book", "content": "The author, most recently, of \u201cNora Webster\u201d and \u201cBrooklyn,\u201d soon to be adapted to film, wishes he were Leopold Bloom: \u201cI envy all the fun he had when he went to Nighttown and got involved in gender-bendering.\u201d\nWhat books are currently on your night stand? \n\u201cTorpor,\u201d by Chris Kraus; \u201cSelected Poems of Fulke Greville,\u201d edited by Thom Gunn; \u201cA Journey With Two Maps,\u201d by Eavan Boland; Toni Morrison\u2019s \u201cGod Help the Child.\u201d Tessa Hadley\u2019s \u201cMarried Love,\u201d Patrick McGrath\u2019s \u201cConstance\u201d and Lynne Tillman\u2019s \u201cWhat Would Lynne Tillman Do?\u201d\nWho is your favorite novelist of all time?\nHenry James, for the range of his sympathy and the quality of his prose. For the way in which he dramatizes moral issues while all the time attending to sensuous and stylish questions. For his seriousness about form in his fiction and the way in which he refuses to allow the reader to make easy judgments, for his insisting on nuance, half-light and suggestion, and for his deep understanding of the strangeness and the wavering nature of motive and feeling in human relationships.\nWhom do you consider the best writers \u2014 novelists, essayists, critics, journalists, poets \u2014 working today? \nNovelists: Laszlo Krasznahorkai, Don DeLillo, Marilynne Robinson, John Banville, Javier Mar\u00edas.\nEssayists: Richard Rodriguez, Joan Didion, Pankaj Mishra.\nCritics: Denis Donoghue, Marjorie Perloff, Helen Vendler, Christopher Ricks, Stephen Burt.\nJournalists: Perry Anderson, Jane Kramer, Fintan O\u2019Toole.\nPoets: John Ashbery, Yves Bonnefoy, Louise Gl\u00fcck, Adam Zagajewski, Paul Muldoon.\nWhat genres do you especially enjoy reading? And which do you avoid?\nI am normal. I read poetry and fiction and biography and history and books about landscape and painting. I avoid crime novels and thrillers and spy books and books about philosophy (especially metaphysics and ethics), self-help books or books that might have happy endings, or books that are long-winded.\nWhat\u2019s the last book that made you laugh?\nIn Princeton a few years ago I was lying in bed alone on a Monday night reading Leo Bersani\u2019s \u201cIs the Rectum a Grave?\u201d Outside was the deep dark New Jersey night. It was winter. I gazed around my sublet bedroom; I looked at the title of the book. Then I stood up and went to the full-length mirror and peered into it. I thought: You are one sad man. And I laughed so much at that thought that I began to cry.\nThe last book that made you cry?\nSee above.\nThe last book that made you furious?\nI don\u2019t do fury. (I mean, where would it end?) But I do wonder was George Eliot wise to spell out what happened later to the main characters in the afterword of her novel \u201cMiddlemarch.\u201d\nWhom do you consider the most underrated or unappreciated writers, past and present?\nGeorge Moore from the past (\u201cEsther Waters\u201d is his masterpiece); Eugene McCabe from the present (\u201cDeath and Nightingales\u201d is his masterpiece).\nDo you read different kinds of books depending on where you are living at the time?\nIn the summer I try and finish one long story or short novel a day, usually ones I have read before. For example: Tolstoy\u2019s \u201cHadji Murad,\u201d James\u2019s \u201cThe Turn of the Screw,\u201d Conrad\u2019s \u201cHeart of Darkness,\u201d Joyce\u2019s \u201cThe Dead,\u201d Samuel Beckett\u2019s \u201cCompany,\u201d Nadine Gordimer\u2019s \u201cThe Late Bourgeois World,\u201d Juan Goytisolo\u2019s \u201cThe Blind Rider,\u201d Philip Roth\u2019s \u201cEveryman,\u201d John McGahern\u2019s \u201cThe Country Funeral,\u201d David Malouf\u2019s \u201cThe Valley of Lagoons,\u201d Tobias Wolff\u2019s \u201cOld School,\u201d Richard Ford\u2019s \u201cRock Springs,\u201d Don DeLillo\u2019s \u201cCosmopolis.\u201d\nWho are your favorite Irish writers? And what are the best books about Ireland?\nI love Tim Robinson\u2019s books on the Irish landscape and heritage \u2014 especially \u201cStones of Aran\u201d and his trilogy of books about Connemara \u2014 for the depth of his knowledge and the way he makes sentences. The other books I would suggest to anyone who wanted to make sense of Ireland over the past hundred years or so are the poems of Paul Durcan, the plays of Tom Murphy, the novels of Anne Enright and Roy Foster\u2019s two-volume biography of Yeats.\nWho\u2019s your favorite fictional hero or heroine? Your favorite antihero or villain? \nI wish I was Leopold Bloom, the man who wanders Dublin in \u201cUlysses.\u201d I love the way he notices and registers things, his wit, his sensuous good humor. I envy all the fun he had when he went to Nighttown and got involved in gender-bendering. The villain I like best is Casaubon in \u201cMiddlemarch.\u201d Since I am aging, solitary and bookish myself, I feel real sympathy for him and am sure that Dorothea, whom he marries, could not have been a bundle of laughs. Casaubon is given a raw deal in the book, and readers like to dislike him, but the older I get the more sympathy I have for him as he tries to finish an unfinishable book and then is brave enough to get married to a young woman. I feel sorry when he dies.\nWhat kind of reader were you as a child? Which childhood books and authors stick with you most?\nI could not read until I was 9, by which time I had developed a serious stammer. Although my mother once warned me that being a dimwit was likely to have dire consequences, my parents were sweet enough not to mention my stammer or my non-reading much and were smart enough not to seek professional help. They left me to myself. Thus I have no childhood books or authors, but I had plenty of time to think and also to study things and people. I did then learn to read, and I think I disturbed the folks more when I became addicted to poetry and, as a teenager, learned Sylvia Plath\u2019s \u201cDaddy\u201d by heart. It took me a bit longer to get rid of the stammer. Even still, in leading a mystery of the rosary, I have no problem with \u201cOur Father\u201d since it begins with a vowel, or \u201cHail Mary\u201d since it starts with a soft H, but I have to do a hell of a lot of light and heavy breathing as I approach the hard consonant start of \u201cGlory be to the Father.\u201d\nIf you had to name one book that made you who you are today, what would it be?\n\u201cHamlet\u201d gave me permission to mourn my father\u2019s death, to make smart remarks to teachers, to make fun of my betters, to procrastinate, to keep my best lines for my conversations with myself, to enjoy the theater, to do whatever I pleased, to view all forms of authority with sourness. I would never have been able to do any of these things with the same intensity had I not read that book when I was 15.\nIf you could require the president to read one book, what would it be? \nAnyone in power, including the president, would benefit from Jaroslav Hasek\u2019s \u201cThe Good Soldier Svejk,\u201d which is set during the First World War in Austria-Hungary. First because it would make them laugh, and then because it is the best antiwar novel I know, hilariously dramatizing the pointlessness of empires and the foolishness of military goals and the sheer absurdity and cruelty of people waging war on each other.\nYou\u2019re hosting a literary dinner party. Which three writers are invited?\nJames Baldwin, Robert Louis Stevenson, Christopher Marlowe. After dinner we would do a spliced reading of Baldwin\u2019s \u201cGiovanni\u2019s Room,\u201d Stevenson\u2019s \u201cDr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\u201d and Marlowe\u2019s \u201cEdward II.\u201d We would also have fun, I hope, making sly and suggestive comments to Stevenson about his sexuality. I would also enjoy listening to Marlowe reading aloud his poem \u201cHero and Leander,\u201d which is one of my favorite poems. And I bet Baldwin would enjoy the reading too, not to speak of Stevenson.\nDisappointing, overrated, just not good: What book did you feel you were supposed to like, and didn\u2019t? Do you remember the last book you put down without finishing?\nOh yes, I do remember the last book I put down without finishing it. It was the Old Testament. I wonder if I am alone in thinking it slightly overrated, or \u201cjust not good,\u201d as you phrase it? Some of it is nice, but very little of it seems to be true, at least to me, and much of it is repetitive and overwritten, and some of it is plain dumb and quite foolish and offensive. (I like the New Testament, however, or most of it, especially St. John\u2019s Gospel, and finish it regularly.)\nWhom would you want to write your life story?\nLyndall Gordon or maybe Janet Malcolm.\nWhat books do you find yourself returning to again and again?\nAt Columbia, I teach books that I care about, and always reread them in the week before the class. This means that every year I get to revisit 19th-century novels such as \u201cPride and Prejudice,\u201d \u201cThe Portrait of a Lady\u201d and \u201cMiddlemarch,\u201d and then Irish classics such as \u201cThe Tain,\u201d \u201cDubliners,\u201d Elizabeth Bowen\u2019s \u201cThe Last September,\u201d Flann O\u2019Brien\u2019s \u201cAt Swim-Two-Birds\u201d and Beckett\u2019s \u201cMolloy.\u201d\nWhat books are you embarrassed not to have read yet?\nI still have not read Thomas Mann\u2019s tetralogy \u201cJoseph and His Brothers.\u201d\nWhat do you plan to read next? \nGary Indiana\u2019s new memoir, \u201cI Can Give You Anything but Love.\u201d\n", "date": "Oct. 1, 2015", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/04/books/review/colm-toibin-by-the-book.html", "tags": "toibin make book books read favorite colm \u201d last time"}
