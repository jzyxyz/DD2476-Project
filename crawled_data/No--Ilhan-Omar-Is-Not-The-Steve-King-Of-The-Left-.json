{"title": "No- Ilhan Omar Is Not The Steve King Of The Left-", "content": "Ilhan Omar, the freshman Democrat from Minnesota who has only been in government for two months, is at the center of yet another political storm.\nPoliticians from both sides of the aisle have accused her of anti-Semitism in response to her controversial stance criticizing the influence of the pro-Israel lobby within the U.S.\u00a0At the same time, she is contending with increased death threats and Islamophobic attacks as a result of those criticisms.\nOn Tuesday,\u00a0The Washington Post published a column\u00a0by conservative blogger Henry Olsen comparing Omar to the white supremacist congressman Steve King (R-Iowa). And Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other top Democrats announced a new resolution targeting anti-Semitism, likely to be voted on Thursday, in a move that, many said, specifically focused on Omar\u2019s previous statements linking support for Israel to lobbying money.\nThe reaction to Omar\u2019s comments has been loud and unequivocal, but many are concerned it\u2019s unwarranted, and others say that she is an easy target as a black Muslim woman.\nNoura Erakat, a human rights lawyer and an assistant professor at George Mason University based in Washington, D.C., said the bipartisan consensus supporting the U.S.- Israeli relationship is inevitably changing. She said that Omar is part of a new class of freshmen members of Congress who are challenging the public discourse.\nStudies have shown that young millennials are increasingly distancing themselves from Israel and its policies. Human rights groups have long criticized Israel\u2019s crippling 12-year blockade on the Gaza Strip, as well as the West Bank occupation that they say violates international human rights laws.\u00a0Erakat also pointed out that the political situation inside Israel is also rapidly transforming, arguably for the worse, as Israel\u2019s current administration has warped into extreme right-wing government.\nSo when Omar began her term in Congress with her taboo views on Israeli policies, the freshmen congresswoman had already set a precedent for controversy, said Erakat. In addition to being a visible, black, Muslim woman who is also a refugee, it becomes too easy for her attackers to lean into racist, Islamophobic attacks to silence her.\nAs of Wednesday morning, Pelosi\u2019s resolution was postponed after a number of progressive groups asked for more time to review the situation. Pelosi told House Democrats that an updated version of resolution will include language condemning anti-Muslim rhetoric.\nOmar, who has faced condemnations from members of her own Democratic party, as well as the GOP, was forced back into the limelight after critics from both sides denounced her recent comments at a Washington event last Wednesday.\n\u201cI want to talk about the political influence in this country that says it is OK for people to push for allegiance to a foreign country,\u201d Omar told attendees at the event held at a bookstore. She also said that her detractors had unfairly characterized her criticism of Israeli policies under the guise of anti-Semitism.\nIt was because of those new statements that another round of backlash began. The chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Rep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), called for Omar to apologize. Rep. Juan Vargas (D-Calif.) tweeted that \u201cquestioning support for the U.S.-Israeli relationship is unacceptable,\u201d while Rep. Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.) accused Omar of engaging in bigotry.\nOmar responded to Lowey\u2019s tweet with a 7-part tweet thread of her own that stated lawmakers like Lowey should be able to distinguish between anti-Semitism and criticism of Israeli policies.\n\u201cI am told everyday that I am anti-American if I am not pro-Israel. I find that to be problematic and I am not alone. I just happen to be willing to speak up on it and open myself to attacks.,\u201d Omar tweeted.\nThe latest controversy occurred just as the FBI announced that it was investigating death threats made against the congresswoman in her home state of Minnesota. Not even 24 hours later, an Islamophobic poster was discovered outside the West Virginia House of Delegates chamber which depicted an image of the Twin Towers during the Sept. 11 attacks with the words \u201cNever Forget \u2015 You Said.\u201d Omar\u2019s face is positioned right under the towers where the caption continued, \u201cI am the proof you have forgotten.\u201d\nBut instead of condemning the storm of anti-Muslim hatred Omar faced, lawmakers were eerily silent. Among of the few lawmakers that spoke out included Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) who lamented on the blatant hypocrisy by members of Congress who were quick to criticize Omar just weeks ago but were nowhere to be found when Omar found herself dealing with a multitude of Islamophobic threats.\nNylah Burton, a freelance writer who recently published an op-ed titled \u201cAs a Black Jew, The Ilhan Omar Controversy Is Incredibly Exhausting\u201d is among those young millennials whose perception on Israel has changed over the years. Burton told HuffPost in a phone call that she believes Democrats threw Omar under the bus.\n\u201cThere are fifteen other conversations that we need to be having but we\u2019re not having them because we can\u2019t see past this dichotomy that we\u2019ve been given and that\u2019s what\u2019s really messed up about this entire thing,\u201d Burton said.\nParticularly angered by the false equivalency between Omar and King noted in the Washington Post piece, Burton said she wants to see the government \u201cremove actual white nationalists in Congress and from our highest offices\u201d and that Omar shouldn\u2019t be removed, but in fact, supported.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just so many levels of unfairness. It\u2019s disgusting actually,\u201d Burton said of the Omar and King comparison. \u201cTo think that Ilhan Omar is like Steve King is delusional. Steve King is a violent anti-Semite.\u201d\nKing has repeatedly espoused white supremacist views and used his official government website to direct his constituents to a white nationalist blogs that regularly publishes the work of anti-Semites and Nazi sympathizers, HuffPost has previously found. Yet King continues to hold his position within a Congress for the last 16 years with little to no condemnations from his peers.\nBurton also argued the resolution put forward was a \u201cgesture meant to attack Omar and not to attack of the anti-Semites in Congress, in our presidency who have enabled extreme levels of anti-Semitism leading to the deadliest attack on American Jews in American history.\u201d\n\u201cThis resolution does not send a message to them. It sends a message to Omar and to people who support Omar. Those are not the people who need that message,\u201d she continued.\nImani Gandy is a legal analyst at Rewire.News,\u00a0who identifies as a secular Jewish black woman and has followed the developments around Omar and the accusations of anti-Semitism. Like Burton, Gandy was dismayed by the Post\u2019s column.\n\u201c[Omar] is not the enemy. She\u2019s certainly a person who maybe needs to have some conversations with Jewish people and figure out how to be more precise with her language,\u201d said Gandy. \u201cThere\u2019s a space for that and she has been open to that.\u201d But she completely dismissed the accusations that Omar is inherently anti-Semitic let alone is Omar anything close to King and other politicians like him.\nRebecca Pierce, a filmmaker who is currently working on a documentary about asylum-seekers in Israel, denied the accusations that Omar was anti-Semitic. She, like Gandy and Burton, argued that the biggest threat to Jews like herself was not Omar\u2019s comments but the threats of white supremacy.\n\u201cThere\u2019s something really harmful about comparing something as pervasive as systematic white supremacy to comments you didn\u2019t like coming from a black person,\u201d she said. \u201cIt minimizes the history and the current reality of white supremacy which is literally killing black, brown, Jewish people in this country.\u201d\nPierce said the Omar was being \u201cheld to a very different standard\u201d than other problematic politicians like King and Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif) who have pushed anti-Semitic conspiracy theories were a bigger threat to the American-Jewish community. The conversation, Pierce said, has been reductive and pitted the black and Jewish community against each other.\nBut academics like Erakat, say whether the resolution passes or not, it doesn\u2019t solve the core issue at hand. With anti-Semitism and Islamophobic rhetoric at an all-time high, alongside the apparent complications differentiating the pro-Israel lobby from the diversity of opinions among Jewish-Americans, it has become imperative to discuss what each of those looks like.\n\u201cThis should be a learning moment but nobody talks about it. Instead, they just point fingers to shut down the conversation but they are not willing to engage in a substantive discussion,\u201d Erakat said.\nOmar echoed this during her most recent comments at the event in Washington, saying it\u2019s important to embrace the concerns of her Jewish constituents but also include those supporters who are concerned about Palestinian human rights.\n\u201cWe never really allow space for the stories of Palestinians seeking safety and sanctuary to be uplifted,\u201d Omar said. \u201cAnd to me, it is the dehumanization and the silencing of a particular pain and suffering of people should not be OK and normal.\u201d", "date": "\n03/06/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/no-ilhan-omar-is-not-the-steve-king-of-the-left_n_5c7ff540e4b020b54d8137e8", "tags": "steve anti-semitism omar \u201d white no- israel left- ilhan king like burton"}
