{"title": "New York Attorney General Sues Trump Foundation After 2-Year Investigation", "content": "The New York State attorney general\u2019s office filed a scathingly worded lawsuit on Thursday taking aim at the Donald J. Trump Foundation, accusing the charity and the Trump family of sweeping violations of campaign finance laws, self-dealing and illegal coordination with the presidential campaign.\nThe lawsuit, which seeks to dissolve the foundation and bar President Trump and three of his children from serving on nonprofit organizations, was an extraordinary rebuke of a sitting president. The attorney general also sent referral letters to the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Election Commission for possible further action, adding to Mr. Trump\u2019s extensive legal challenges.\nThe lawsuit, filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, culminated a nearly two-year investigation of Mr. Trump\u2019s charity, which became a subject of scrutiny during and after the 2016 presidential campaign. While such foundations are supposed to be devoted to charitable activities, the petition asserts that Mr. Trump\u2019s was often improperly used to settle legal claims against his various businesses, even spending $10,000 on a portrait of Mr. Trump that was hung at one of his golf clubs.\nThe foundation was also used to curry political favor, the lawsuit asserts. During the 2016 race, the foundation became a virtual arm of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, email traffic showed, with his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, directing its expenditures, even though such foundations are explicitly prohibited from political activities.\nThe attorney general\u2019s office is seeking the Trump Foundation to pay $2.8 million in restitution, the amount raised for the foundation at a 2016 Iowa political fund-raiser. At the time, Mr. Trump skipped a Republican debate and set up his own event to raise money for veterans, though he used the event to skewer his opponents and celebrate his own accomplishments.\nMr. Trump immediately attacked the lawsuit, characterizing it in a Twitter post as an attempt by the \u201csleazy New York Democrats\u201d to damage him by suing the foundation, and vowing not to settle the case \u2014 much as he did when the same office filed a lawsuit accusing Trump University. (Mr. Trump in 2016 paid a $25 million settlement to resolve the inquiry.)\nThe $10,000 portrait of Mr. Trump was one of \u201cat least five self-dealing transactions\u201d facilitated by the foundation, according to the attorney general\u2019s office, violating tax regulations that prohibit using nonprofit charities for private interests.\nIn 2007, to settle a dispute between the City of Palm Beach and Mr. Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort, the foundation paid $100,000 to the Fisher House Foundation, another charity.\nIn 2012, a man named Martin B. Greenberg sued the Trump National Golf Club after he made a hole in one at a fund-raising golf tournament that had promised to pay $1 million to golfers who aced the 13th hole, as he did. As part of a settlement, the charitable foundation paid $158,000 to a foundation run by Mr. Greenberg.\nThe foundation also paid $5,000 to one organization for \u201cpromotional space featuring Trump International Hotels,\u201d and another $32,000 to satisfy a pledge made by a privately held entity controlled by Mr. Trump to a charitable land trust.\n[For more on the foundation: The Donald J. Trump Foundation, Explained]\nThe foundation lawsuit, and the referrals to the federal agencies, are the latest of Mr. Trump\u2019s voluminous legal challenges, starting with the ongoing investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into ties between Mr. Trump, his associates and Russia.\nThe attorney general\u2019s action is also likely to embolden critics who have accused Mr. Trump of flouting legal norms. Mr. Trump has suggested he might pardon himself in the Mueller investigation and has repeatedly assailed the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\u201cAs our investigation reveals, the Trump Foundation was little more than a checkbook for payments from Mr. Trump or his businesses to nonprofits, regardless of their purpose or legality,\u201d said Barbara D. Underwood, New York\u2019s attorney general, who has been on the job a little over a month. \u201cThis is not how private foundations should function and my office intends to hold the foundation accountable for its misuse of charitable assets.\u201d\nMany of the examples cited in the lawsuit were first reported by The Washington Post.\nNumerous state and federal laws preclude nonprofit organizations and charities like the Trump Foundation from lobbying, aiding a political campaign, or giving undue benefits that further a person\u2019s self-interests, rather than those of the organization. The restrictions are in place to ensure that donations are used for the expressed purpose of the nonprofits; violations can result in penalties, including revocation of the organization\u2019s nonprofit status.\nThe petition notes that Mr. Trump himself signed annual I.R.S. filings, under penalty of perjury, in which he attested that the foundation did not engage in political activity. \u201cThis statutory prohibition is absolute.\u201d\nYet after the Iowa fund-raiser, Mr. Trump\u2019s foundation \u201cceded control over the charitable funds it raised to senior Trump campaign staff, who dictated the manner in which the foundation would disburse those proceeds, directing the timing, amounts and recipients of the grants,\u201d according to the petition.\nThat same month, an official at the foundation emailed Mr. Lewandowski, who was Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager at the time, telling him \u201cwe should start thinking about how you want to distribute the funds collected.\u201d\nMr. Lewandowski, in a reply, wrote that \u201cI think we should get the total collected and then put out a press release that we distributed the $$ to each of the groups.\u201d He later sent a list of veterans\u2019 groups \u201cpurportedly approved by Mr. Trump to receive grants from the Foundation.\u201d\nThe list was created by another campaign staffer, Lisa Maciejowski Gambuzza, and edited by a third, Stuart Jolly, a political director. And Mr. Lewandowski asked that some of the disbursements be made in Iowa in the days before that state\u2019s presidential nominating caucuses, which mark the kickoff of the primary calendar.\nAllowing the campaign to control the spending of the foundation\u2019s charitable funds represented coordination between the two entities, as well as \u201can improper in-kind contribution of no less than $2.823 million (the amount donated to the foundation) to the campaign,\u201d according to the lawsuit.\nBeyond the restitution, the foundation and its directors could face several million dollars in additional penalties, depending on how the court rules. The attorney general\u2019s office is also seeking to bar the president from serving as a director, officer or trustee of another nonprofit for 10 years.\nLikewise, the petition seeks to bar Mr. Trump\u2019s three eldest children, Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric, from the boards of nonprofits based in New York or that operate in New York for one year, which would have the effect of barring them from a wide range of groups based in other states.\nWhile the three eldest children ostensibly served on the foundation board from 2006 to 2017, the board never even met after 1999, according to the petition, which called the foundation \u201can empty shell that functions with no oversight by its board of directors.\u201d\nThe action could force Mr. Trump\u2019s children to curtail relationships with a variety of organizations. Last year, for example, Ms. Trump said she created a charitable fund, the Ivanka M. Trump Charitable Fund, to receive the unpaid portion of her book advance and any future royalties. In her government ethics report disclosed on Monday, she said she donated $289,300 to the fund. However, no publicly filed reports are available for that group yet.\nAfter the election, Eric Trump distanced himself from his charitable foundation, which has also been under investigation by the attorney general\u2019s office related to shifting its resources to the Trump Organization.\nMr. Trump long feuded with Ms. Underwood\u2019s predecessor, Eric Schneiderman, who resigned last month amid a scandal involving allegations that he had physically abused a number of his girlfriends. Weeks after the 2016 election, Mr. Schneiderman\u2019s office issued a \u201cnotice of violation\u201d to the foundation, which had already attracted scrutiny over its practices, and ordered it to immediately stop soliciting charitable donations in the state.\nAmanda Miller, a spokeswoman for the Trump Organization, released a statement from the Trump Foundation on Thursday that characterized the lawsuit as \u201cpolitics at its very worst.\u201d The statement accused Mr. Schneiderman of using the foundation investigation \u201cto not only advance his own political goals, but also for his own political fund-raising,\u201d and suggested that Ms. Underwood has shown that \u201csuch political attacks will continue unabated.\u201d\nMr. Schneiderman\u2019s resignation had raised questions whether his office, which had been at the heart of the Democratic legal resistance against the Trump administration, would persist in such efforts.\nBy filing the lawsuit, Ms. Underwood, who is a career prosecutor rather than a politician, seems inclined to do so.\nShe also recently accused Mr. Trump of \u201cundermining the rule of law\u201d with his pardon practices. She made the comment when she announced she was continuing an effort begun under Mr. Schneiderman to change New York\u2019s double-jeopardy law so that state and local prosecutors would have the power to bring criminal charges against aides to Mr. Trump who have been pardoned.\nThe Trump Foundation has been in legal limbo since after the election, when the president wanted to dissolve it amid growing controversy about its practices. But in late 2016, a spokeswoman for the attorney general\u2019s office, Amy Spitalnick, said the foundation \u201ccannot legally dissolve\u201d while it is under investigation.\nThe attorney general\u2019s referrals to the I.R.S. and the F.E.C. could add another wrinkle that might slow the foundation\u2019s dissolution. The agencies are not known for their expeditious handling of enforcement actions, and the lawsuit notes that the foundation cannot legally complete its wind down \u201cuntil the complaints to the Internal Revenue Service and Federal Election Commission have been resolved and it is determined if any penalties or fines will be imposed on the foundation.\u201d", "date": "June 14, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/14/nyregion/trump-foundation-lawsuit-attorney-general.html", "tags": "general lawsuit office york \u201c investigation sues trump campaign new foundation attorney"}
