{"title": "Protests Pop Up Across Iran, Fueled by Daily Dissatisfaction", "content": "TEHRAN \u2014 Across Iran\u2019s heartland, from the sweltering heat of its southern cities to the bustling capital, protesters have taken to the streets with increasing intensity in recent months, much to the satisfaction of the Trump administration, which is hoping the civil unrest will put pressure on Iranian leaders.\nSome demonstrations \u2014 about the weak economy, strict Islamic rules, water shortages, religious disputes, local grievances \u2014 have turned deadly. The protesters have shouted harsh slogans against clerical leaders and their policies. The events are broadly shared on social media and on the dozens of Persian language satellite channels beaming into the Islamic republic.\nOn Thursday, protests were held in the cities of Arak, Isfahan, Karaj and Shiraz, as people \u2014 in numbers ranging in the hundreds, perhaps more \u2014 took to the streets, chanting slogans like \u201cdeath to high prices,\u201d but also criticizing top officials. A smaller protest was held in Tehran, where some people were arrested, according to videos taken at the scene.\nIn the city of Eshtehard, west of the capital, protesters attacked a religious school on Thursday, forcing 500 clerics in training to flee, the semiofficial Tasnim news agency reported.\nTruck drivers who went on strike in May for higher wages restarted their strike last week. The strike has affected fuel deliveries, leaving some gasoline stations empty in parts of the country, including Caspian Sea areas north of Tehran.\nIran\u2019s currency, the rial, has lost nearly 80 percent of its value compared with a year ago, weakened at least in part because the Trump administration withdrew the United States from the nuclear agreement in May and restored American economic sanctions. The first batch of those restored sanctions is set to take effect on Monday.\nPresident Hassan Rouhani of Iran, who supported the nuclear agreement, is under fire not only from hard-liners but also from the Iranians who voted for him \u2014 the vast middle class. Both groups say his economic policies have failed.\nThe demonstrations began after a week of unprecedented nationwide protests in January. In more than 80 cities, including Tehran, people took to the streets with economic demands and calls for more freedoms. In total, 25 people were killed and more than 4,000 were arrested.\nThe protests over the past six months have been relatively isolated, sporadic, scattered and much smaller than the antigovernment demonstrations in 2009, when millions took to the streets. But they reflect a common theme of rising dissatisfaction, many say.\nActivists critical of the government concede the demonstrations do not threaten Iran\u2019s leadership. Security forces, mindful of the 2009 upheavals, are now much better equipped to crush any organized antigovernment demonstrations. The protesters share neither unifying leadership nor clear agenda.\nWhile many members of the large middle class are unhappy, they mostly watch from the sidelines, adverse to uncertainty.\n\u201cThere is no vision, no leadership, and the protests will not lead to any chain reaction across the country, at this point,\u201d said Bahman Amoei, a well-known political activist who has spent several stints in jail for his activities.\n\u201cI have to admit that the state, its security and propaganda machine, is capable of engineering public opinion very successfully and persuade the wider populace that the status quo is in their favor and change will be too costly,\u201d he said.\nHowever, for the country of 80 million, long one of the calmest in the Middle East, the growing list of demonstrations and strikes is remarkable.\nIn July, brokers of Tehran\u2019s vast bazaar marched across the city protesting high prices and clashing with security forces near the Parliament building. Protesters in the southern border city of Khorramshahr clashed with security forces for days over water shortages. Defying risk of arrest, women have protested the compulsory Islamic head scarf. In February, deadly clashes erupted between members of a religious minority and security forces. In March, protests over water shortages spread to Isfahan, Iran\u2019s third largest city.\nThere also have been strikes, most notably in the Kurdish regions, where bazaars closed in April to protest restrictions on border trade. Truckers went on strike the following month. In the city of Kazeroun, two people were killed in clashes over plans to redraw its borders.\nVideos show that some protesters have gone well beyond strictly economic grievances to challenge Iran\u2019s foreign policy and religious rules. Secular protest slogans aimed at Iran\u2019s leadership also criticize its support for Syria and groups in the Palestinian territories and in Lebanon. Often protesters evoke the name of Reza Shah, an authoritarian who industrialized Iran at the beginning of the century, with a very firm hand. In Khorramshahr, videos showed protesters shouting: \u201cYou have plundered us in the name of religion.\u201d\nBecause of travel restrictions placed on foreign reporters, it is hard to determine the scope of demonstrations and clashes around the country.\nInterviews with protesters in Tehran suggest they are exasperated with what many view as the government\u2019s economic incompetence and corruption. One said that he felt as if his life were shrinking by the day and simply could not take it anymore.\n\u201cWe had been given bad news for days, our hearts were full of anger,\u201d said the protester, Hassan Seyedi, a broker at the Alaedine electronics bazaar in Tehran.\nIn recent months, he and his colleagues spontaneously closed their shops and took to the streets, shouting slogans and clashing with the police. Other merchants closed their shops in solidarity. In front of the Parliament building, a crowd of hundreds shouted: \u201cDeath to freeloading bigwigs!\u201d\n\u201cWe filmed and took selfies; the second day we went out again,\u201d Mr. Seyedi said. But now his was back in his small shop, where he pays a monthly rent of more than $3,100. \u201cI can\u2019t afford to protest too long,\u201d he said. \u201cI need to make any money I can.\u201d\nThe protests have compounded the increasingly dire predicament that Iran\u2019s leaders face as they prepare to deal with the restored American sanctions. Foreign investors are leaving the country, and the Iranian government, anticipating less oil income, has tightened the use of foreign currency. That move has accelerated the decline in the rial, driving anger that seems more aimed at Iran\u2019s leaders than the United States.\nHard-liners have consistently played down the protests. \u201cAround a hundred people take to the streets in cities populated by five million people,\u201d said Hamidreza Taraghi, a political analyst. He accused Iran\u2019s enemies, most notably the United States, Saudi Arabia and Israel, of helping foreign based opposition groups. \u201cForeign powers are seeking to seize upon our economical problems and create unrest.\u201d\nIran\u2019s leaders are struggling to come up with new solutions to keep their country running. Instead, factional feuds are leading to daily accusations of corruption and decadence.\nLast month a website linked to a former presidential candidate, Mehdi Karroubi, who has been under house arrest since 2011, alleged that Gen. Qassem Soleimani, a hero of the hard-liners, was part of a mafia importing cars. Hard-line news outlets criticized photographs of Mr. Rouhani wearing foreign brands. Beyond the accusations, no one seems to have a solution.\n\u201cThere is incompetence on all levels,\u201d said Hojjat Kalashi, a sociologist who has been banned from leaving the country because of his writings. \u201cOur officials keep on hoping for some form of an international breakthrough, a deal that will solve everything, but in reality they have no strategy.\u201d\nAt Tehran\u2019s Grand Bazaar, things were back to normal after the protests and strike last month. In the gold trading area, one merchant, Mostafa Arabzadeh, admitted that he had also closed his shop. \u201cTo protect my valuables,\u201d he said.\nMr. Arabzadeh said he disliked the protesters and felt they were playing into the hands of Iran\u2019s enemies. \u201cPeople that are angry forget we have one thing the rest of the region doesn\u2019t have: peace and stability,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe should cherish that.\u201d\nBut many agreed that the protests and the strikes would continue in one form or another. \u201cPeople are no longer afraid to show their dissatisfaction,\u201d said Abolghasem Golbaf, a publisher.\nWhen schools reopen after the summer break, Mr. Golbaf said, students and professors would very likely join the demonstrations, possibly presenting a new challenge to security forces. \u201cPeople want their voices heard,\u201d he said.", "date": "Aug. 4, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/04/world/middleeast/iran-protests.html", "tags": "pop iran country protests tehran daily demonstrations protesters \u201d dissatisfaction fueled across"}
