{"title": "Donald Trump Says He Should Have Left UCLA Players Jailed In China", "content": "President Donald Trump tweeted Sunday that he shouldn\u2019t have helped orchestrate the release of three college basketball players from a Chinese jail after they were caught shoplifting last week.\nThe president accused LaVar Ball, the father of one of the players, of not taking the shoplifting allegations seriously enough. Hours later, Trump went after Ball again, tweeting that the media personality and businessman was\u00a0\u201cvery ungrateful\u201d for Trump\u2019s personal intervention in the matter.\nTrump\u2019s bitter remarks come just days after Ball downplayed the president\u2019s role in securing the release of his son, LiAngelo Ball, and his son\u2019s UCLA teammates,\u00a0Cody Riley and Jalen Hill.\n\u201cEverybody wants to make it seem like [Trump] helped me out,\u201d the elder Ball told ESPN\u00a0on Friday. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot worse things happen than a guy taking some glasses. My son has built up enough character that one bad decision doesn\u2019t define him.\u201d\nThe three players returned to Los Angeles on Tuesday after being accused of shoplifting from high-end stores during a trip to China. UCLA has suspended them from the team indefinitely.\nOn Wednesday, Trump slammed the players for not thanking him for his help, tweeting that they could have spent 10 years in jail. Hours later, the players apologized for their actions and expressed gratitude to Trump.\n\u201cI\u2019m a young man, however, it\u2019s not an excuse for making a really stupid decision,\u201d the younger Ball said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel sorry for myself and I\u2019ve learned my lesson from this big mistake and I\u2019m 110 percent sure that I will not make a bad decision like this again.\u201d\nThis post has been updated with an additional tweet from Trump.", "date": "\n11/19/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-ucla-jail-china_n_5a11d0e2e4b0e97dffee09d3", "tags": "left china son jailed \u201d trump players helped donald says shoplifting decision ucla ball"}
