{"title": "With Ships and Missiles, China Is Ready to Challenge U.S. Navy in Pacific", "content": "DALIAN, China \u2014 In April, on the 69th anniversary of the founding of China\u2019s Navy, the country\u2019s first domestically built aircraft carrier stirred from its berth in the port city of Dalian on the Bohai Sea, tethered to tugboats for a test of its seaworthiness.\n\u201cChina\u2019s first homegrown aircraft carrier just moved a bit, and the United States, Japan and India squirmed,\u201d a military news website crowed, referring to the three nations China views as its main rivals.\nNot long ago, such boasts would have been dismissed as the bravado of a second-string military. No longer.\nA modernization program focused on naval and missile forces has shifted the balance of power in the Pacific in ways the United States and its allies are only beginning to digest.\nWhile China lags in projecting firepower on a global scale, it can now challenge American military supremacy in the places that matter most to it: the waters around Taiwan and in the disputed South China Sea.\nThat means a growing section of the Pacific Ocean \u2014 where the United States has operated unchallenged since the naval battles of World War II \u2014 is once again contested territory, with Chinese warships and aircraft regularly bumping up against those of the United States and its allies.\nTo prevail in these waters, according to officials and analysts who scrutinize Chinese military developments, China does not need a military that can defeat the United States outright but merely one that can make intervention in the region too costly for Washington to contemplate. Many analysts say Beijing has already achieved that goal.\nTo do so, it has developed \u201canti-access\u201d capabilities that use radar, satellites and missiles to neutralize the decisive edge that America\u2019s powerful aircraft carrier strike groups have enjoyed. It is also rapidly expanding its naval forces with the goal of deploying a \u201cblue water\u201d navy that would allow it to defend its growing interests beyond its coastal waters.\n\u201cChina is now capable of controlling the South China Sea in all scenarios short of war with the United States,\u201d the new commander of the United States Indo-Pacific Command, Adm. Philip S. Davidson, acknowledged in written remarks submitted during his Senate confirmation process in March.\nHe described China as a \u201cpeer competitor\u201d gaining on the United States not by matching its forces weapon by weapon but by building critical \u201casymmetrical capabilities,\u201d including with anti-ship missiles and in submarine warfare. \u201cThere is no guarantee that the United States would win a future conflict with China,\u201d he concluded.\nLast year, the Chinese Navy became the world\u2019s largest, with more warships and submarines than the United States, and it continues to build new ships at a stunning rate. Though the American fleet remains superior qualitatively, it is spread much thinner.\n\u201cThe task of building a powerful navy has never been as urgent as it is today,\u201d President Xi Jinping declared in April as he presided over a naval procession off the southern Chinese island of Hainan that opened exercises involving 48 ships and submarines. The Ministry of National Defense said they were the largest since the People\u2019s Republic of China was founded in 1949.\nEven as the United States wages a trade war against China, Chinese warships and aircraft have picked up the pace of operations in the waters off Japan, Taiwan, and the islands, shoals and reefs it has claimed in the South China Sea over the objections of Vietnam and the Philippines.\nWhen two American warships \u2014 the Higgins, a destroyer, and the Antietam, a cruiser \u2014 sailed within a few miles of disputed islands in the Paracels in May, Chinese vessels rushed to challenge what Beijing later denounced as \u201ca provocative act.\u201d China did the same to three Australian ships  passing through the South China Sea in April.\nOnly three years ago, Mr. Xi stood beside President Barack Obama in the Rose Garden and promised not to militarize artificial islands it has built farther south in the Spratlys archipelago. Chinese officials have since acknowledged deploying missiles there, but argue that they are necessary because of American \u201cincursions\u201d in Chinese waters.\nWhen Defense Secretary Jim Mattis visited Beijing in June, Mr. Xi bluntly warned him that China would not yield \u201ceven one inch\u201d of territory it claims as its own.\nChina\u2019s naval expansion began in 2000 but accelerated sharply after Mr. Xi took command in 2013. He has drastically shifted the military\u2019s focus to naval as well as air and strategic rocket forces, while purging commanders accused of corruption and cutting the traditional land forces.\nThe People\u2019s Liberation Army \u2014 the bedrock of Communist power since the revolution \u2014 has actually shrunk in order to free up resources for a more modern fighting force. Since 2015, the army has cut 300,000 enlisted soldiers and officers, paring the military to two million personnel over all, compared with 1.4 million in the United States.\nWhile every branch of China\u2019s armed forces lags behind the United States\u2019 in firepower and experience, China has made significant gains in asymmetrical weaponry to blunt America\u2019s advantages. One focus has been in what American military planners call A2/AD, for \u201canti-access/area denial,\u201d or what the Chinese call \u201ccounter-intervention.\u201d\nA centerpiece of this strategy is an arsenal of high-speed ballistic missiles designed to strike moving ships. The latest versions, the DF-21D and, since 2016, the DF-26, are popularly known as \u201ccarrier killers,\u201d since they can threaten the most powerful vessels in the American fleet long before they get close to China.\nThe DF-26, which made its debut in a military parade in Beijing in 2015 and was tested in the Bohai Sea last year, has a range that would allow it to menace ships and bases as far away as Guam, according to the latest Pentagon report on the Chinese military, released this month. These missiles are almost impossible to detect and intercept, and are directed at moving targets by an increasingly sophisticated Chinese network of radar and satellites.\nChina announced in April that the DF-26 had entered service. State television showed rocket launchers carrying 22 of them, though the number deployed now is unknown. A brigade equipped with them is reported to be based in Henan Province, in central China.\nSuch missiles pose a particular challenge to American commanders because neutralizing them might require an attack deep inside Chinese territory, which would be a major escalation.\nThe American Navy has never faced such a threat before, the Congressional Research Office warned in a report in May, adding that some analysts consider the missiles \u201cgame changing.\u201d\nThe \u201ccarrier killers\u201d have been supplemented by the deployment this year of missiles in the South China Sea. The weaponry includes the new YJ-12B anti-ship cruise missile, which puts most of the waters between the Philippines and Vietnam in range.\nWhile all-out war between China and the United States seems unthinkable, the Chinese military is preparing for \u201ca limited military conflict from the sea,\u201d according to a 2013 paper in a journal called The Science of Military Strategy.\nLyle Morris, an analyst with the RAND Corporation, said that China\u2019s deployment of missiles in the disputed Paracel and Spratly Islands \u201cwill dramatically change how the U.S. military operates\u201d across Asia and the Pacific.\nThe best American response, he added, would be \u201cto find new and innovative methods\u201d of deploying ships outside their range. Given the longer range of the ballistic missiles, however, that is not possible \u201cin most contingencies\u201d the American Navy would be likely to face in Asia.\nThe aircraft carrier that put to sea in April for its first trials is China\u2019s second, but the first built domestically. It is the most prominent manifestation of a modernization project meant to propel the country into the upper tier of military powers. Only the United States, with 11 nuclear-powered carriers, operates more than one.\nA third Chinese carrier is under construction in a port near Shanghai. Analysts believe China will eventually build five or six.\nThe Chinese military, traditionally focused on repelling a land invasion, increasingly aims to project power into the \u201cblue waters\u201d of the world to protect China\u2019s expanding economic and diplomatic interests, from the Pacific to the Atlantic.\nThe carriers attract the most attention but China\u2019s naval expansion has been far broader. The Chinese Navy \u2014 officially the People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy \u2014 has built more than 100 warships and submarines in the last decade alone, more than the entire naval fleets of all but a handful of nations.\nLast year, China also introduced the first of a new class of a heavy cruisers \u2014 or \u201csuper destroyers\u201d \u2014 that, according to the American Office of Naval Intelligence, \u201care comparable in many respects to most modern Western warships.\u201d Two more were launched from dry dock in Dalian in July, the state media reported.\nLast year, China counted 317 warships and submarines in active service, compared with 283 in the United States Navy, which has been essentially unrivaled in the open seas since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.\nUnlike the Soviet Union, which drained its coffers during the Cold War arms race, military spending in China is a manageable percentage of a growing economy. Beijing\u2019s defense budget now ranks second only to the United States: $228 billion to $610 billion, according to estimates by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.\nThe roots of China\u2019s focus on sea power and \u201carea denial\u201d can be traced to what many Chinese viewed as humiliation in 1995 and 1996. When Taiwan moved to hold its first democratic elections, China fired missiles near the island, prompting President Bill Clinton to dispatch two aircraft carriers to the region.\n\u201cWe avoided the sea, took it as a moat and a joyful little pond to the Middle Kingdom,\u201d a naval analyst, Chen Guoqiang, wrote recently in the official Navy newspaper. \u201cSo not only did we lose all the advantages of the sea but also our territories became the prey of the imperialist powers.\u201d\nChina\u2019s naval buildup since then has been remarkable. In 1995, China built only three new submarines to begin replacing an older fleet that totaled 83. It now has nearly 60 new submarines and plans to expand to nearly 80, according to a report by the United States Congressional Research Service.\nAs it has in its civilian economy, China has bought or absorbed technologies from the rest of the world, in some cases illicitly. Much of its military hardware is of Soviet origin or modeled on antiquated Soviet designs, but with each new wave of production, analysts say, China is deploying more advanced capabilities.\nChina\u2019s first aircraft carrier was originally launched by the Soviet Union in 1988 and left to rust when the nation collapsed three years later. Newly independent Ukraine sold it for $20 million to a Chinese investor who claimed it would become a floating casino, though he was really acting on behalf of Beijing, which refurbished the vessel and named it the Liaoning.\nThe second aircraft carrier \u2014 as yet unnamed \u2014 is largely based on the Liaoning\u2019s designs, but is reported to have enhanced technology. In February, the China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation disclosed that it has plans to build nuclear-powered carriers, which have far greater endurance than ones that require refueling stops.\nChina\u2019s military has encountered some growing pains. It is hampered by corruption, which Mr. Xi has vowed to wipe out, and a lack of combat experience. As a fighting force, it remains untested by combat.\nIn January, it was embarrassed when one of its most advanced submarines was detected as it neared disputed islands known as the Senkaku in Japan and the Diaoyu in China. The attack submarine should never have been spotted.\nThe second aircraft carrier also appears to have experienced hiccups. Its first sea trials were announced in April and then inexplicably delayed. Not long after the trials went ahead in May, the general manager of China Shipbuilding was placed under investigation for \u201cserious violation of laws and discipline,\u201d the official Xinhua news agency reported, without elaborating.\nChina\u2019s military advances have nonetheless emboldened the country\u2019s leadership.\nThe state media declared the carrier Liaoning \u201ccombat ready\u201d in the summer after it moved with six other warships through the Miyako Strait that splits Japan\u2019s Ryukyu Islands and conducted its first flight operations in the Pacific.\nThe Liaoning\u2019s battle group now routinely circles Taiwan. So do Chinese fighter jets and bombers.\nChina\u2019s new J-20 stealth fighter conducted its first training mission at sea in May, while its strategic bomber, the H-6, landed for the first time on Woody Island in the Paracels. From the airfield there or from those in the Spratly Islands, the bombers could strike all of Southeast Asia.\nThe recent Pentagon report noted that H-6 flights in the Pacific were intended to demonstrate the ability to strike American bases in Japan and South Korea, and as far away as Guam.\n\u201cCompetition is the American way of seeing it,\u201d said Li Jie, an analyst with the Chinese Naval Research Institute in Beijing. \u201cChina is simply protecting its rights and its interests in the Pacific.\u201d\nAnd China\u2019s interests are expanding.\nIn 2017, it opened its first overseas military base in Djibouti, on the Horn of Africa, saying that it will be used to support its participation in multinational antipiracy patrols off Somalia.\nIt now appears to be planning to acquire access to a network of ports and bases throughout the Indian Ocean. Though ostensibly commercial, these projects have laid the groundwork for a necklace of refueling and resupply arrangements that will \u201cfacilitate Beijing\u2019s long-range naval operations,\u201d according to a new report by C4ADS, a research organization in Washington.\n\u201cThey soon will be able, for example, to send a squadron of ships to somewhere, say in Africa, and have all the capabilities to make a landing in force to protect Chinese assets,\u201d said Vassily Kashin, an expert with the Institute of Far Eastern Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow.\nThe need was driven home in 2015 when Chinese warships evacuated 629 Chinese and 279 foreigners from Yemen when the country\u2019s civil war raged in Aden, a southern port city.\nOne of the frigates involved in the rescue, the Linyi, was featured in a patriotic blockbuster film, \u201cOperation Red Sea.\u201d\n\u201cThe Chinese are going to be more present,\u201d Mr. Kashin added, \u201cand everyone has to get used to it.\u201d", "date": "Aug. 29, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/29/world/asia/china-navy-aircraft-carrier-pacific.html", "tags": "challenge ships military china naval u.s. missiles united states \u201d navy chinese sea pacific ready \u2014"}
