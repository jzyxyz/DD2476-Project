{"title": "A Friendship Built for Long Distance", "content": "In January, when the elite marathoner Kara Goucher found out she was pregnant, she knew exactly whom to ask for advice. Paula Radcliffe, the women\u2019s world-record holder and mother of a 3-year-old daughter, had just arrived in Portland, Ore., to train with her.\nThe topic of pregnancy became more personal for Radcliffe a few days later when she, too, learned she was expecting. She and Goucher are due to give birth on the same date in late September.\n\u201cWe were both really excited and really happy,\u201d said Goucher, who had been forthright in her desire to have a baby in time to regroup for the 2012 Olympics.\nBefore this year, the friendship between Goucher, a 32-year-old American, and Radcliffe, a 36-year-old Briton, was based mainly on e-mail messages with occasional meetings at races. They became acquainted at the 2007 Great North Run, a prestigious half-marathon in England, in which Goucher staged a surprise win over Radcliffe. A few weeks later, Goucher watched Radcliffe win the New York City Marathon.\n\u201cThere was a lot of respect there, but I didn\u2019t know her well enough to classify her as a good friend,\u201d Radcliffe said in a phone interview.\nThey grew close while spending their first trimester together.\n\u201cShe\u2019s now one of my very best friends,\u201d Goucher said in a recent interview at Nike headquarters in Beaverton, Ore. \u201cI feel I can ask her anything, and she\u2019ll tell me. That came over time. It wasn\u2019t like I asked her everything on our first run.\u201d\nIn the first few weeks of pregnancy, Goucher and Radcliffe met every morning at 9:30, after Radcliffe dropped off her daughter, Isla. They ran together, doing tempo runs, hill repeats and track workouts wearing heart-rate monitors to gauge their intensity. They occasionally met in the afternoon for a second workout, although Goucher often napped instead because of pregnancy-induced fatigue.\n\u201cIt helped to have someone going through it at the same time even though we didn\u2019t have the exact same feelings on the exact same day,\u201d Radcliffe said. \u201cIf you haven\u2019t gone through pregnancy, you don\u2019t know what that type of tiredness feels like, what being wiped out feels like.\u201d\nGoucher, who finished third in the 2008 New York City and 2009 Boston marathons, benefited from Radcliffe\u2019s advice to  leave her watch at home during hill repeats  and to cut runs short when she feels a twinge.\n\u201cShe\u2019s been giving me a lot of advice on chilling out,\u201d Goucher said. \u201cShe helped me realize I\u2019m not failing. She\u2019s helped me realize I can just push to my limits.\u201d\nRadcliffe said she did not see herself as a \u201cmommy mentor.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cI didn\u2019t sit down and lecture her;  I passed along bits to her,\u201d  by consulting the training diary she kept during her first pregnancy. \u201cIt helped her accept it.\u201d\nRadcliffe reminded Goucher to eat before lifting weights, which they started doing together at Week 8 of their pregnancies.\n\u201cI felt a bit like a mum when I\u2019d nag her to eat,\u201d Radcliffe said, laughing.\nGoucher cited recent solo workouts as proof she had listened.\nOn May 2, she ran 13 miles at 6 minutes 50 seconds per mile. But  the next day, she ran six miles at an 8:15 pace.\n\u201cI was tired on that run,\u201d Goucher said. \u201cThat used to upset me when I\u2019d have a bad day, but now I know it is what it is. When I feel really tired, I\u2019ll just cut my mileage back and in the afternoon do the elliptical or bike.\u201d\nBut Radcliffe said they were \u201ccompetitive animals\u201d who occasionally pushed themselves too hard. They told of a track workout that consisted of various sprints, and they took turns leading.\nGoucher said she ran too fast \u201cbecause it was Paula Radcliffe running behind me.\u201d Then Radcliffe felt she had to lead as fast as Goucher had. Looking at their monitors during a brief respite, their heart rates skyrocketed, Goucher said. They recruited Radcliffe\u2019s husband, Gary Lough, to lead them for the remainder of the workout.\nTheir training is intense but  within the most recent physical-activity guidelines for pregnant women from the United States Department of Health and Human Services.\n\u201cThe recommendations say women can sustain the level of their activity prior to pregnancy,\u201d said Danielle Symons Downs, an associate professor of kinesiology and obstetrics and gynecology at Penn State who researches pregnancy and exercise.\nRadcliffe and Goucher, she said, are \u201cright in the guidelines with their vigorous activity.\u201d\nOther experts disagree.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know it\u2019s safe for high-level marathon runners to run at that level during pregnancy,\u201d said Dr. Mona Shangold, the director of the Center for Women\u2019s Health and Sports Gynecology in Philadelphia. \u201cIt has not been shown that running for that long, for that intensity, is safe.\u201d\nNonetheless, Goucher and Radcliffe are planning to convene for the New York Mini 10K, a women\u2019s race on June 12 in Central Park put on by the New York Road Runners.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an excuse for us to get together;  a chance to hang together before we get too pregnant to travel,\u201d Goucher said with a laugh. \u201cWe are really just running it for fun. Not racing.\u201d\nRadcliffe agreed, adding that they may have Mary Wittenberg, the Road Runners\u2019 president, accompany them to ensure that they do not go too fast.\nAs for their competitive paths and relationship after they give birth, Goucher and Radcliffe intend to qualify for  the 2012 Olympic marathon in London.\n\u201cWhen both of us stand on the start line and the gun goes off, we both want to win that race,\u201d Radcliffe said. \u201cBut there\u2019s room for a really good friendship at the same time.\u201d", "date": "MAY 8, 2010", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/09/sports/09marathon.html", "tags": "radcliffe distance really goucher \u201d together pregnancy long friendship women time built"}
