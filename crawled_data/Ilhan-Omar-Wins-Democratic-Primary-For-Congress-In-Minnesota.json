Ilhan Omar won the Democratic primary on Tuesday for the\u00a0state\u2019s 5th Congressional District, putting her on a path to make history.\nOmar defeated four other Democratic candidates in a crowded race\u00a0to fill the seat that opened up when Rep. Keith Ellison (D) announced his bid to become the state\u2019s attorney general. She\u2019ll face Republican Jennifer Zielinski in November\u2019s general election. In the solidly Democratic district, Omar is the favorite to prevail.\nIf Omar wins the seat, she will become one of the nation\u2019s first Muslim women in Congress \u2015 she\u2019ll likely be joined in the historic feat by fellow Democrat\u00a0Rashida Tlaib, who won her primary for a House seat in Michigan last week. Tlaib is all but guaranteed to win in November in her heavily Democratic district, earning a spot in the nation\u2019s history books.\nFor Omar \u2015 who was born in Somalia and spent four years in a refugee camp in Kenya before coming to the U.S. at age 12 \u2015 breaking barriers will be nothing new. When she was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in 2016, she became the nation\u2019s\u00a0first Somali-American legislator.\n\u201cI hope my candidacy would allow people to have the boldness to encourage people who don\u2019t fit into [a] particular demographic to seek office,\u201d she told HuffPost that year. \u201cTo believe in the good will of the people to select someone they believe shares their vision and not necessarily their identity.\u201d \u00a0\nOmar, a mother of three who\u2019s lived in Minnesota for two decades, is one of a\u00a0record number of Muslim candidates\u00a0running for office in 2018, along with an unprecedented\u00a0number of women.\nShe\u2019s also part of a movement of progressive candidates seeking to push the Democratic Party establishment further left. Omar is running on a progressive platform, including a $15 per hour minimum wage, Medicare for All and abolishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. She was endorsed by the Justice Democrats \u2015 the progressive political group that backed Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York in her now-famous upset win.\nOmar on Tuesday night tweeted her thanks to those who helped her win the primary.\nOmar\u2019s candidacy comes at a particularly trying time for Muslim Americans, who over the past couple of years have faced\u00a0a spike in hate crimes\u00a0amid President Donald Trump\u2019s election, as well as\u00a0Islamophobic rhetoric and policies\u00a0from the White House and a travel ban upheld by the Supreme Court that targets mostly Muslim-majority countries.\n\u201cOftentimes, you are told to be everything but bold, but I think that was important for me in running as a young person and running as someone who is Muslim, a refugee, an immigrant,\u201d Omar told HuffPost\u00a0in 2016. \u201cTo believe in the possibility that all of my identities and otherness would fade into the background, and that my voice as a strong progressive would emerge if I was bold and believed in that.\u201d\nThis story has been updated with Omar\u2019s tweet.", "date": "\n08/14/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ilhan-omar-congress-minnesota_n_5b5a49abe4b0fd5c73cd7760", "tags": "primary progressive wins omar minnesota \u201d \u2015 muslim running democratic ilhan state congress"}
