{"title": "Spain\u2019s Wine Industry Is Hiccuping From Its Excesses", "content": "TOMELLOSO, Spain \u2014 For many, winemaking conjures up images of rolling vineyards, oak barrels and cavernous cellars.\nBut here at Virgen de las Vi\u00f1as, or Virgin of the Vineyards, the biggest producer in Spain\u2019s largest wine region, production comes in the shape of giant steel vats and hoses connected to tank trucks. Employees work three shifts to keep the place running 24 hours a day.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t elaborate wine here \u2014 we produce wine,\u201d said Isidro Rodr\u00edguez, the company\u2019s technical director. \u201cThis is really a factory.\u201d\nThis is the unromantic side of winemaking in the region of Castile-La Mancha, which accounts for half of Spain\u2019s wine production. Most of it is sold in bulk and transported abroad, where it can be mixed with other wines and even re-exported.\nWhile Spain\u2019s producers churned out vast quantities of wine, some began to reconsider whether sheer volume was the best strategy, as overproduction sank both prices and the country\u2019s wine reputation.\n\u201cCastile-La Mancha ticks all the boxes as a bulk agricultural region, but perhaps not all of them for higher quality wine,\u201d said Miguel \u00c1ngel Benito, a sommelier and technical director of a wine museum in Pe\u00f1afiel, in Castile and Le\u00f3n, another wine region.\n\u201cSpain has been tapping into a growing market for bulk,\u201d he added, \u201cbecause there are millions of people who love wine but can\u2019t afford an expensive bottle.\u201d\nYet even some bulk producers in Castile-La Mancha are feeling a hangover from too much of a good thing.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve boosted our exports significantly, but probably too rapidly, so that we\u2019ve now got the wrong price pyramid, with a lot of wine sold very cheaply,\u201d said Rafael del Rey, the director of the Spanish Observatory of the Wine Market, an institute that researches and promotes the country\u2019s wine.\nIn recent years, France and Italy have jostled for the top spot as the world\u2019s biggest wine-producing nation, with Spain third, well ahead of countries like the United States, Chile and Australia.\nThe bulk producers in Castile-La Mancha are understandably proud of the state-of-the-art irrigation, harvest mechanization and storage systems that they put in place, with help from European Union subsidies. Coupled with relatively low labor costs, their infrastructure has allowed them to lower the price of their wine to half that of France\u2019s.\nBut Mr. del Rey offers a telling comparison between Spain and Italy. In 2000, both countries exported their wine at the same average price, 1.41 euros per liter. By 2014, Italy was selling its wine for an average of \u20ac2.5 per liter, or $2.78 under the current exchange rate, while Spain\u2019s sold for \u20ac1.17, or $1.30.\nIn that period, Italian exports rose 15 percent in volume and Spain\u2019s 154 percent. But Spain\u2019s export revenue reached only \u20ac2.6 billion, about half the value of Italian exports.\nSpain\u2019s bulk wine has displaced Italy\u2019s on the European market, particularly in France. Spain now sells about 500 million liters to France, 90 percent of which are bulk exports, at an average price of four-tenths of a euro per liter.\nFrance has recently been exporting almost 250 million liters of bulk wine, at an average of \u20ac1.24, three times Spain\u2019s price, Mr. del Rey said.\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying that exactly the same liter that left Spain is then re-exported from France,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s undeniable that some Spanish wine becomes part of French exports, with a lot of added value.\u201d\nBut even Spain\u2019s neighbors are beginning to complain that the country is producing too much wine \u2014 and dumping it in their markets.\nIn April, French farmers stopped five Spanish trucks near the border and drained their wine onto the road, to protest what they see as unfair competition. Spain\u2019s Foreign Ministry then complained to France, saying it needed to prevent such attacks.\nCes\u00e1reo Cabrera del Prado, the president of El Progreso, a large producer in Castile-La Mancha, said he could understand that some French farmers were upset, \u201cbut each country has its strengths.\u201d\nWhile Spain has been undercutting France\u2019s production costs for wine, he said, \u201cFrench dairy farmers have done the same to our Spanish milk.\u201d\nEl Progreso bottles only about 5 percent of its wine, the most expensive of which retails for \u20ac6, or $6.67, a bottle. Most of its wine is instead poured into the tanks of trucks, and some is then packaged through the bag-in-box system. A plastic bag of as much as 20 liters is placed inside a cardboard box, which sometimes already carries a foreign name.\nIn one corner of the El Progreso warehouse, for instance, there are boxes marked as an American brand, but they also carry a \u201cProduct of Spain\u201d label of origin.\nSome Spanish wine regions, however, have changed their ways.\nTwo decades ago, the authorities in La Rioja, in northern Spain, introduced legislation requiring producers to bottle their wine. The measure was challenged, going as far as the European Court of Justice, which in 2000 rejected a case brought by somebody who still wanted to import bulk Rioja wine.\nCould Castile-La Mancha follow Rioja\u2019s lead? That \u201csounds right but is simply not practical,\u201d mainly because of the size of Castile-La Mancha\u2019s vineyards, said Javier de la Fuente, the general manager of the Rioja wine regulatory council.\nWhen Rioja introduced the ban, bulk wine accounted for only 5 percent of its production, he said, while in Castile-La Mancha, \u201ca lot of big producers absolutely rely on bulk and its economies of scale.\u201d\nAlthough many experts believe Spain should reduce its reliance on bulk wine, such an overhaul could be harmful, they said, particularly to the thousands of farmers in Castile-La Mancha who sell their grapes for bulk production.\nCastile-La Mancha\u2019s producers began to emphasize bulk wine in 2009 after the European Union decided to end subsidies for distilled alcohol.\nStrong harvests since then have pushed Spain\u2019s pricing toward record lows, and Virgen de las Vi\u00f1as is hoping to break even this year, after reporting a loss last year, said Enrique Cepeda, its chief executive. He does not expect prices to rise soon.\n\u201cSomebody who makes a Seat would be happy to sell instead a Porsche,\u201d Mr. Cepeda said, comparing bulk wine to Spain\u2019s household car brand. \u201cBut you can\u2019t make such a switch easily.\u201d\nStill, some smaller producers in Castile-La Mancha are gaining recognition for the quality of their wine \u2014 and finding it increasingly uncomfortable to cohabit with their giant neighbors.\nCarlos Falc\u00f3, a Spanish aristocrat whose family runs the Marqu\u00e9s de Gri\u00f1\u00f3n wine estate, recently began lobbying politicians to help shift this region away from bulk wine.\n\u201cWhen I have a foreign customer visiting my cellar and I want to sell him a bottle for 20, 30 or 40 euros, the fact that he might know that there are bottles sold nearby for just a few cents doesn\u2019t really help,\u201d Mr. Falc\u00f3 said.", "date": "May 28, 2016", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/29/world/europe/spains-wine-industry-is-hiccuping-from-its-excesses.html", "tags": "wine bulk castile-la excesses \u201d mancha industry hiccuping producers spain france"}
