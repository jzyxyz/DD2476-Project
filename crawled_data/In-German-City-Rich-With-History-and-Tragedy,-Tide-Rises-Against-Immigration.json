{"title": "In German City Rich With History and Tragedy, Tide Rises Against Immigration", "content": "DRESDEN, Germany \u2014 As it does every Advent, this history-laden city has erected the gift stalls, the gl\u00fchwein stands and the Ferris wheel of Germany\u2019s oldest Christmas market, around the Frauenkirche, the 18th-century church that was magnificently rebuilt after the Allies\u2019 catastrophic bombing in 1945. But this year, there is tension behind the seasonal jollity.\nFor the past seven Mondays, people have taken up the battle cry of East Germans protesting their Communist government 25 years ago \u2014 \u201cWir sind das Volk!\u201d (\u201cWe are the people!\u201d) \u2014 and fashioned it into a lament about being overlooked by political leaders of the present.\nDresden\u2019s demonstrators, echoing the populist fears coursing around Europe, are a motley mix of far right-wingers in the National Democratic Party, or N.P.D., young hooligans and ordinary folk who feel ignored as foreigners pour into Germany \u2014 at least 200,000 this year alone \u2014 seeking jobs or asylum.\nFirst hundreds, now thousands have responded to the summons from a previously unknown activist, Lutz Bachmann, 41, and an organization called Pegida, a German acronym for a title that translates roughly as Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West.\nOn Monday, a record 7,500 showed up despite teeth-chattering cold, for an hourlong march through Dresden\u2019s center, a mix of grim Socialist architecture and gems of the pre-1945 past. National flags were flown. One placard said, \u201cWe miss our country,\u201d while another demanded, \u201cProtection of the Heimat,\u201d or homeland, \u201cnot Islamization.\u201d\nCarefully kept at shouting distance by the police, several hundred opponents yelled their disagreement. \u201cRefugees are welcome here!\u201d they chanted in English before blocking the Pegida crowd from reaching Dresden\u2019s famed Theater Square, bordered by the beautiful Semperoper opera house and the Zwinger museum, home to one of the finest European art collections.\nDespite its rich culture and its present-day prosperity, Dresden is no stranger to right-wingers or hatred of foreigners. But as dissatisfaction simmers throughout Europe over the arrival of migrants, events in this city of 530,000 people have come as a surprise.\n\u201cThey are clearly Nazis,\u201d said Kathi Wetzel, 50, when asked at her food stall about the demonstrators, though, she added, the marches also swept up \u201csimple hangers-on who don\u2019t really know why they are going along.\u201d\nMartin Landseck, 32, pouring beer at another stand, took a far less definite attitude. \u201cLet\u2019s wait and see,\u201d he said, about which side has the better case.\nClearly, Pegida has touched a nerve. In Germany, where the economy is still growing and more people have jobs than ever before, no equivalent has emerged to France\u2019s Marine LePen and her populist National Front, and no leaders have ridden discontent to power like Prime Minister Victor Orban in Hungary.\nThe Islamization evoked by Pegida is hardly imminent, with only about 2 percent of the population in the Saxony region foreign, and only a fraction of those Muslim.\nBut right-wingers and soccer hooligans banded together in Cologne this fall and overran police officers in violent protests they said were aimed at Islamic extremism. Dresden is almost the anti-Cologne \u2014 determinedly antiviolent and careful in its fliers and patriotic placards to stay on the right side of laws banning hate speech \u2014 yet focused on many of the same targets.\nIn Pegida, \u201cObviously, we are dealing with a mixed group \u2014 known figures from the N.P.D., soccer hooligans, but also a sizable number of ordinary burghers,\u201d said Frank Richter, director of Saxony\u2019s state office for political education. He and other East Germans who marched against the Communist government in 1989 cringe at the new demonstrators\u2019 appropriation of the old rallying call. \u201cBut they obviously feel they have not been understood.\u201d\nSome see Dresden\u2019s xenophobia rooted in its Communist past. Before unification, the region was known as \u201cthe valley of the clueless,\u201d because it was the only major urban area in East Germany which could not receive West German television.\nAnd while the rest of Germany was absorbing Turks and other immigrants for decades, the East was largely isolated from foreigners.\nWerner Patzelt, a politics professor at Dresden\u2019s Technical University, noted that \u201cin the past 25 years, East German society underwent a huge process of transformation. People now feel that things are halfway back in order: the new system works, our towns look O.K. and we have jobs \u2014 and now there comes a whole new change and no one asked us.\u201d\nSince reunification in 1990, the N.P.D. has often won seats in the state legislature. While the N.P.D. fell short of the 5 percent hurdle to gain seats in the state legislature last fall, a new populist party, the Alternative for Germany, garnered almost 10 percent of the vote.\nSuspicion of Islam is not unique to eastern Germany, but it is potent, driven like elsewhere on the continent by the swelling of the Muslim population, the alarming flow of European Muslims to Syria or Iraq to wage jihad, and the growing fears that those jihadists might return to inflict harm on their adopted homelands.\nAn announcement in the fall that 14 new facilities would open in Saxony for some 2,000 refugees \u2014 two this year, the others in 2015 and 2016 \u2014 may have been the final straw. At Monday\u2019s demonstration, four men in their 60s were unanimous about the danger. \u201cJust look at the Ruhr,\u201d said one, alluding to industrial cities of western Germany, where migrant ghettos are ever more common. \u201cWe don\u2019t want that here.\u201d\n\u201cOr Berlin,\u201d said a second. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to have to put barbed wire on our balconies,\u201d he said, insisting this was common in the capital to keep foreign burglars at bay. (It is not.)\nMany of the demonstrators refused to identify themselves or be interviewed. But Mr. Bachmann, their leader, eagerly shook hands with a reporter before the march, and insisted that his group is not against refugees from war zones, Islam or foreigners per se.\n\u201cWhat we don\u2019t like here\u201d are economic refugees mooching on the German system, he said. \u201cPoliticians in Germany, they did the whole thing wrong, basically wrong.\u201d\nThe local S\u00e4chsische Zeitung newspaper recently reported that Mr. Bachmann had several criminal convictions \u2014 16 burglaries, driving drunk or without a license and even dealing in cocaine. The report also noted that it was hard to pin down where and how Mr. Bachmann had lived, though it found that, among other things, he had done publicity for nightclubs.\nNews of his record jars with his accusations that arriving foreigners spread crime, but Mr. Bachmann waved it off as a distraction. Yes, he told the crowd. \u201cI, too, have a previous life,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cIf it is better for our cause, I am ready to step out of the unwanted spotlight.\u201d\nNevertheless, he said, he was worried about foreigners who took advantage of Germany\u2019s welfare system, while \u201csome old people can\u2019t afford a slice of Christmas cake.\u201d Pretty soon, he predicted to applause, deformation of the German language would deprive Germans of Christian terms like \u201cChristmas tree.\u201d\nAt the market, Erika Gemende, 74, chatting to a grandson as she sold Christmas sweets, tried to make sense of the Pegida movement.\n\u201cI will help anyone who is fleeing from war; if they need some of my old things, they can have them,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we have to see who gets what.\u201d\nIn this town, she noted, memory plays a part. \u201cMy mother, she was all alone, with the four of us children\u201d after her father was killed in the war, Ms. Gemende said. \u201cNo one helped her.\u201d", "date": "Dec. 7, 2014", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/08/world/in-german-city-rich-with-history-and-tragedy-tide-rises-against-immigration.html", "tags": "history immigration foreigners tragedy germany city rich german rises \u201d pegida east \u2014 dresden tide"}
