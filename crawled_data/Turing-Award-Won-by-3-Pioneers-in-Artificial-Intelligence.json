{"title": "Turing Award Won by 3 Pioneers in Artificial Intelligence", "content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In 2004, Geoffrey Hinton doubled down on his pursuit of a technological idea called a neural network.\nIt was a way for machines to see the world around them, recognize sounds and even understand natural language. But scientists had spent more than 50 years working on the concept of neural networks, and machines couldn\u2019t really do any of that.\nBacked by the Canadian government, Dr. Hinton, a computer science professor at the University of Toronto, organized a new research community with several academics who also tackled the concept. They included Yann LeCun, a professor at New York University, and Yoshua Bengio at the University of Montreal.\nOn Wednesday, the Association for Computing Machinery, the world\u2019s largest society of computing professionals, announced that Drs. Hinton, LeCun and Bengio had won this year\u2019s Turing Award for their work on neural networks. The Turing Award, which was introduced in 1966, is often called the Nobel Prize of computing, and it includes a $1 million prize, which the three scientists will share.\nOver the past decade, the big idea nurtured by these researchers has reinvented the way technology is built, accelerating the development of face-recognition services, talking digital assistants, warehouse robots and self-driving cars. Dr. Hinton is now at Google, and Dr. LeCun works for Facebook. Dr. Bengio has inked deals with IBM and Microsoft.\n\u201cWhat we have seen is nothing short of a paradigm shift in the science,\u201d said Oren Etzioni, the chief executive officer of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Seattle and a prominent voice in the A.I. community. \u201cHistory turned their way, and I am in awe.\u201d\nLoosely modeled on the web of neurons in the human brain, a neural network is a complex mathematical system that can learn discrete tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data. By analyzing thousands of old phone calls, for example, it can learn to recognize spoken words.\nThis allows many artificial intelligence technologies to progress at a rate that was not possible in the past. Rather than coding behavior into systems by hand \u2014 one logical rule at a time \u2014 computer scientists can build technology that learns behavior largely on its own.\nThe London-born Dr. Hinton, 71, first embraced the idea as a graduate student in the early 1970s, a time when most artificial intelligence researchers turned against it. Even his own Ph.D. adviser questioned the choice.\n\u201cWe met once a week,\u201d Dr. Hinton said in an interview. \u201cSometimes it ended in a shouting match, sometimes not.\u201d\nNeural networks had a brief revival in the late 1980s and early 1990s. After a year of postdoctoral research with Dr. Hinton in Canada, the Paris-born Dr. LeCun moved to AT&T\u2019s Bell Labs in New Jersey, where he designed a neural network that could read handwritten letters and numbers. An AT&T subsidiary sold the system to banks, and at one point it read about 10 percent of all checks written in the United States.\nThough a neural network could read handwriting and help with some other tasks, it could not make much headway with big A.I. tasks, like recognizing faces and objects in photos, identifying spoken words, and understanding the natural way people talk.\n\u201cThey worked well only when you had lots of training data, and there were few areas that had lots of training data,\u201d Dr. LeCun, 58, said.\nBut some researchers persisted, including the Paris-born Dr. Bengio, 55, who worked alongside Dr. LeCun at Bell Labs before taking a professorship at the University of Montreal.\nIn 2004, with less than $400,000 in funding from the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research, Dr. Hinton created a research program dedicated to what he called \u201cneural computation and adaptive perception.\u201d He invited Dr. Bengio and Dr. LeCun to join him.\nBy the end of the decade, the idea had caught up with its potential. In 2010, Dr. Hinton and his students helped Microsoft, IBM, and Google push the boundaries of speech recognition. Then they did much the same with image recognition.\n\u201cHe is a genius and knows how to create one impact after another,\u201d said Li Deng, a former speech researcher at Microsoft who brought Dr. Hinton\u2019s ideas into the company.\nDr. Hinton\u2019s image recognition breakthrough was based on an algorithm developed by Dr. LeCun. In late 2013, Facebook hired the N.Y.U. professor to build a research lab around the idea. Dr. Bengio resisted offers to join one of the big tech giants, but the research he oversaw in Montreal helped drive the progress of systems that aim to understand natural language and technology that can generate fake photos that are indistinguishable from the real thing.\nThough these systems have undeniably accelerated the progress of artificial intelligence, they are still a very long way from true intelligence. But Drs. Hinton, LeCun and Bengio believe that new ideas will come.\n\u201cWe need fundamental additions to this toolbox we have created to reach machines that operate at the level of true human understanding,\u201d Dr. Bengio said.", "date": "March 27, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/27/technology/turing-award-ai.html", "tags": "turing intelligence award pioneers bengio way lecun \u201d artificial neural idea hinton research dr."}
