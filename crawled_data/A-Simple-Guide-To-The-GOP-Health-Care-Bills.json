{"title": "A Simple Guide To The GOP Health Care Bills", "content": "An updated version of this article was published on July 14.\nSenate Republicans released their draft health care bill Thursday, unveiling a proposed rollback of Medicaid expansion and funding while ensuring hefty tax cuts for the wealthy and health care companies. Among other things, the bill reduces the number of middle-income people eligible to get tax credits for private health insurance, eliminates the individual and employer mandates, and bans\u00a0Planned Parenthood\u00a0from receiving any federal funding for one year.\nThe Senate\u2019s bill is similar to the one the\u00a0House passed last month. The Senate bill would cut Medicaid more than the House measure, allow insurers to charge older people higher rates and permit states to waive rules guaranteeing insurance covers a basic set of benefits. The Senate bill does not include some of the particularly harsh aspects of the House legislation, including a provision that would let states end protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\nThis story has been updated to reflect changes to the Senate legislation.\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this graphic said pre-existing conditions were treated the same under the House and Senate bills. The Senate bill has pre-existing condition provisions similar to the current law, and the graphic has been updated.", "date": "\n06/22/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/senate-health-care-bill-guide_n_594c05bde4b0a3a837be6195", "tags": "updated version pre-existing gop simple medicaid house guide senate bill bills care health"}
