{"title": "9 Outrageous Things Donald Trump Has Said About Latinos", "content": "Donald Trump\u2019s affront to the Latino community reached new heights last week after Mexican-American journalist Jorge Ramos was forcibly removed\u00a0from the presidential candidate\u2019s Iowa press conference. But it wasn\u2019t the first time Trump has offended Latinos.\nHis anti-Latino remarks have cost him several business partners\u00a0since the launch of his campaign in June, including NBCUniversal, which aired Trump\u2019s reality show \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d and co-owns the Miss Universe Organization. Several prominent figures in the Latino community have also spoken out against Trump; actress America Ferrera and singer Ricky Martin published\u00a0scathing op-eds condemning Trump\u2019s actions\u00a0and rallying Latinos to unite against him.\nEven though\u00a0only 18 percent of Hispanics\u00a0take Trump seriously as a presidential candidate, the Republican has vowed that he \u201cwill win the Latino vote\u201d\u00a0if nominated.\nIf Trump wants to win the Latino vote, he might want to learn from past mistakes. Here are 9 of the most outrageous things the presidential candidate has said about Latinos.", "date": "\n08/31/2015", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/9-outrageous-things-donald-trump-has-said-about-latinos_n_55e483a1e4b0c818f618904b", "tags": "things community candidate win latinos several trump \u201d donald presidential latino said outrageous"}
