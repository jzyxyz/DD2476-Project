{"title": "Donald Trump Again Falsely Credits Himself With 'Essentially' Repealing Obamacare", "content": "President Donald Trump on Tuesday falsely claimed that congressional Republicans\u2019 tax bill \u201cessentially Repeals (over time) ObamaCare,\u201d perpetuating a false claim\u00a0he made previously to celebrate the bill\u2019s passage.\u00a0\nThe GOP tax bill, which Trump signed into law last week, eliminates the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate, but leaves other essential parts of the law intact.\nTrump also argued in his tweet that both parties would \u201ceventually come together\u201d to work on a replacement for Obamacare. But that remains to be seen, as Republicans failed earlier this year to pass legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act outright, and Democrats are committed to protecting the health care law.\nIn place of complete repeal, Republicans have devised other ways to weaken the law\u2019s provisions, such as by\u00a0eliminating the individual mandate, which will worsen insurance markets.\nBut the tax bill does not affect other important provisions of Obamacare, such as protections for people with pre-existing conditions, tax credits for people who buy their own insurance and the expansion of state Medicaid programs. And nearly 9 million people enrolled in Obamacare for 2018, despite efforts by Trump and GOP leaders to undermine the program.\nThat has not stopped Trump from falsely taking credit for \u201cessentially\u201d repealing it.", "date": "\n12/26/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-tax-bill-repeal-obamacare_n_5a42414ce4b0b0e5a7a3464b", "tags": "credits care tax obamacare republicans \u201d trump donald repealing bill falsely law"}
