The transaction, worth 1.2 billion euros, or about $1.3 billion, takes Midea a step closer to purchasing all of Kuka, which could be the biggest takeover of a Germany company by a Chinese buyer.\nMidea \u2014 which manufacturers consumer electronics like air-conditioners and rice cookers \u2014 holds 13.5 percent of Kuka shares and will become the largest shareholder, once it acquires Voith\u2019s stake.\nThe deal has encountered political resistance in Germany, where politicians wanted Kuka to remain an independent German brand. Sigmar Gabriel, the German minister for economic affairs and energy, spoke out broadly last month against Chinese purchases of German companies, citing the Chinese government\u2019s direct role in its economy.\nDuring a visit to China last month, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said that she would not block the deal, but she also said that nothing was stopping a German bidder from emerging.\nAfter Midea made promises to shield Kuka\u2019s data and keep its business locations and jobs in place, Kuka\u2019s board recommended last week that shareholders accept the offer. Kuka said that its industrial property rights and the data of its customers and suppliers would be protected by the agreement and that Midea would not be able to gain access to or move databases.\n\u201cWe conducted intensive negotiations with Midea and ensured that the announced assurances have now been made legally binding,\u201d said Till Reuter, Kuka\u2019s chief executive. \u201cIt protects the interests of our company, our business partners, our employees and our shareholders until well into the next decade.\u201d\nRobots made by Kuka, based in Augsburg, Germany, have already helped Midea, which employs about 100,000 people, to reduce its staff as part of its efforts to automate more of its production lines.\nMidea, based in Foshan, China, said it would support Kuka\u2019s efforts to expand in China and would work with it to move into making service robots for consumers.\nThe deal highlights China\u2019s interest both in German companies as acquisition targets and in the machinery sector. China\u2019s deals with Germany have increased in number to 25 so far this year from 11 for the period in 2015, according to data from Dealogic.\nMidea had built up a stake in Kuka before making a \u20ac4.6 billion takeover offer in June. The offer, still on the table, of \u20ac115 per share represented a premium of nearly 60 percent over Kuka\u2019s closing price on Feb. 3, before Midea increased its stake. Kuka shares closed Friday at \u20ac106.525.", "date": "July 4, 2016", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/05/business/dealbook/germany-china-midea-kuka-technology-robotics.html", "tags": "company kuka closer china midea germany billion step german chinese takeover moves"}
