{"title": "Leaked Recordings Lay Bare E.U. and U.S. Divisions in Goals for Ukraine", "content": "BERLIN \u2014 \u201cReally Pretty Stupid\u201d was the headline chosen by the august Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on Friday to describe an editorial on the latest eruption between the United States and Europe, this time over who should take the lead in trying to calm the crisis in Ukraine, and how to do it.\nThe headline spoke to the tensions that flared this week over the release of a recording in which a top American diplomat disparaged the European Union\u2019s efforts in Ukraine. On Friday, a second recording surfaced in which European diplomats complained about the Americans.\nBut it was also a reflection of the disarray that has marked much of the West\u2019s dealings with Ukraine since late November, when President Viktor F. Yanukovych spurned a pact with the European Union. He then turned to Russia for a $15 billion aid package that the Kremlin has since suspended because of continuing antigovernment protests in Kiev, the capital.\nEver since Ukraine became independent as the Soviet Union crumbled in 1991, the United States and Europe have had different aims for the country, a large, troubled nation of 45 million whose very name means \u201con the edge.\u201d\nWith strategic considerations uppermost in American diplomacy, the United States helped, for instance, to rid Ukraine of old Soviet nuclear weapons. Europe, meanwhile, saw opportunities for trade.\nAs the European Union expanded eastward with the inclusion of Poland and Romania, the perception grew that neighboring Ukraine needed formal ties to regulate commerce and legal systems to facilitate the growing cross-border transactions. In 2012, Poland and Ukraine were even joint hosts of the continent\u2019s premier sports event, the European soccer championship.\nRussia, which has centuries of shared history with Ukraine and under Vladimir V. Putin has grown ever more painfully conscious of its loss of Soviet empire, looked on with mounting suspicion, and now seems to be intent on exploiting Western disarray.\nThe release of the recordings has further roiled the waters. In the first one, posted anonymously on YouTube, Victoria Nuland, the American assistant secretary of state for European affairs, profanely dismissed European efforts in Ukraine as weak and inadequate to the challenge posed by the Kremlin.\nOn Friday, a second recording was posted that featured a senior German diplomat, Helga Schmid, complaining in her native tongue to the European Union envoy in Kiev about \u201cunfair\u201d American criticism of Europe\u2019s diplomacy.\n\u201cWe are not in a race to be the strongest,\u201d retorted the envoy, Jan Tombinski, a Pole. \u201cWe have good instruments\u201d for dealing with the crisis.\nYes, replied Ms. Schmid, but journalists were telling European officials that the Americans were running around saying the Europeans were weak. So she advised Mr. Tombinski to have a word with the United States ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt, the man whom Ms. Nuland was talking to in her recorded conversation.\nWhile the Obama administration accused the Russians of making mischief by recording and then posting the Nuland conversation, neither the European Union nor Germany blamed the Kremlin for the second recording.\nIllustrating how testy relations with Washington have become, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, earlier the target of American monitoring of her cellphone, issued an unusually sharp statement saying that Ms. Nuland\u2019s remarks were \u201ccompletely unacceptable.\u201d\nGermany, as befits its status as Europe\u2019s largest economy and a country with centuries of dealings with lands to its East, has been heavily involved in the crisis over Ukraine. In a speech to the German Parliament on Nov. 18, Ms. Merkel, herself raised in Communist East Germany, emphasized that the Cold War should be over for everyone, including countries once allied with Russia but now independent. She made a forceful case for Ukraine to sign the European pact.\nJulianne Smith, a former national security aide to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. who is now at the Center for a New American Security, said there was a structural tension between the European Union and the United States because the Americans can speak with one voice and grow impatient waiting for decisions from a union with many voices.\n\u201cThey all have different sovereign issues, different threat perceptions, different priorities,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a result, there has always been this longstanding deep frustration on the part of the United States with the inability to get quick answers, quick responses and broker some sort of U.S.-E.U. agreement on whatever the issue of the day might be.\u201d\nThe back-and-forth this week illustrates how many interests are a part of the mix in Ukraine \u2014 a mix that Western diplomats seem unable to keep free of their own differences.\nIn the editorial with the headline \u201cReally Pretty Stupid,\u201d Klaus-Dieter Frankenberger, the newspaper\u2019s foreign editor, noted how the latest issue had been stoked by months of \u201cbad blood\u201d with Washington. \u201cYou can certainly criticize some parts of European policy toward Ukraine, but it is not as if American diplomacy has found the font of all wisdom. In fact, they can\u2019t think of anything more than a few mini-sanctions against the regime in Kiev.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Mr. Frankenberger said, Mr. Putin \u201cshould certainly be laughing himself stupid.\u201d \n\u201cIf a top American diplomat could not care less about the Europeans,\u201d he added, \u201cthen he will certainly bear more easily their absence from the opening of the Olympic Games in Sochi. And he will see in Ms. Nuland\u2019s remark, which Moscow presumably disseminated, a confirmation of the bad opinion he already has of Europeans.\u201d\nThe moral of the tale? \u201cNo disparaging remarks about partners on the phone.\u201d", "date": "Feb. 7, 2014", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/08/world/europe/ukraine.html", "tags": "american goals european e.u lay divisions recording u.s. united bare union \u201d states europe recordings leaked ukraine"}
