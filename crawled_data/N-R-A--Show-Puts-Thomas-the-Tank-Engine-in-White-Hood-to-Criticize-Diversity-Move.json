{"title": "N.R.A. Show Puts Thomas the Tank Engine in White Hood to Criticize Diversity Move", "content": "Even by the standards of today\u2019s political culture, it was a startling image: the talking trains from the children\u2019s television show \u201cThomas & Friends,\u201d wearing Ku Klux Klan hoods.\nThat was what viewers of the National Rifle Association\u2019s online video channel saw as Dana Loesch, a spokeswoman for the gun rights group, took the show to task for diversifying its cast.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve decided that the next stop is Virtue Town,\u201d Ms. Loesch said Friday on \u201cRelentless,\u201d the NRATV program that she hosts. She was responding to news that the children\u2019s show was adding several female and international characters.\nThe segment echoed complaints by some that the additions amounted to politically correct pandering. But it confounded many others who wondered why a spokeswoman for an organization known for fierce advocacy of gun rights would weigh in on programming aimed at preschoolers.\nIn the segment, Ms. Loesch, an outspoken conservative commentator, questioned the decision to add the new characters, including Nia, a train from Kenya. How, she asked, could the children\u2019s show introduce \u201cethnic diversity\u201d when its anthropomorphized characters are mostly trains?\n\u201cI\u2019m really, really struggling to understand how in the world there isn\u2019t any diversity in any of this,\u201d she said, before showing a photo of several characters in Ku Klux Klan hoods in front of burning tracks.\n\u201cFair, I get it,\u201d she deadpanned in response to the image. \u201cThomas the Tank Engine has been a blight on race relations for far too long.\u201d\nThe segment drew the beloved children\u2019s franchise, whose story was created more than 70 years ago, into the increasingly partisan debate over diversity and multiculturalism.\nIn response, Mattel, which owns the Thomas the Tank Engine brand, said it had \u201calways been a priority\u201d for the company to promote inclusivity and kindness.\n\u201cWe are not associated with images that promote hate and denounce any images of our brands that are being used to convey a message not in line with the values of the company,\u201d it said.\n\u201cThomas & Friends\u201d had announced on Friday that it was adding the new characters in partnership with the United Nations, part of an effort to introduce its preschool audience to new cultures and issues.\nIn the show\u2019s coming 22nd season, which begins this month on Nick Jr., the main character, Thomas the Tank Engine, will leave his home on the fictional island of Sodor for the first time in series history. He will travel to China, India and Australia, where he will meet other trains. The show will also add several new female characters.\nThe character Thomas the Tank Engine was invented more than 70 years ago by the Rev. W. Awdry, as a story for his son. Mr. Awdry turned the story into the first of many books in 1945, and in 1984, Thomas became the star of a new British animated show that was narrated by Ringo Starr. The show made its American debut in 1989 on PBS.\nThe N.R.A. did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "date": "Sept. 12, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/12/us/nra-tv-thomas-tank-engine.html", "tags": "characters criticize engine show hood puts tank diversity n.r.a white move \u201d children new thomas"}
