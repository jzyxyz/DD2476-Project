{"title": "Republicans Balk at More Tariffs as Trump Mulls More Farm Aid", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 At a White House meeting this month, Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the powerful Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, pressed President Trump to repeal the metal tariffs he imposed on Canada and Mexico, which he argued were hurting the struggling farmers the president had vowed to protect.\nHours later, Mr. Trump made clear that the message was not received.\n\u201cTariffs are working,\u201d the president said on Twitter, attributing an investment announced by U.S. Steel to the steel and aluminum tariffs Mr. Trump put into effect last year.\nMr. Trump sold his trade disputes with China, Canada, Mexico and Europe as an effort to lower trade barriers. But the rewritten North American Free Trade Agreement has stalled in Congress, Europe is preparing retaliation in the event that Mr. Trump unleashes automobile tariffs this week and negotiations with China have broken down, devolving into an all-out trade war.\nThe collateral damage has been America\u2019s farmers, and Mr. Grassley, a generally loyal ally to the president, has emerged as his chief critic on trade.\nSpeaking to reporters on Tuesday, Mr. Grassley, an Iowa farmer himself, warned that Mr. Trump could face political consequences if the pain that farmers are feeling continues to fester.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to have some impact on elections, of course,\u201d Mr. Grassley said. \u201cSo far, I haven\u2019t seen farmers abandoning Trump, but it\u2019s going to have some impact.\u201d\nMr. Trump last week raised tariff rates on $200 billion of Chinese imports to 25 percent from 10 percent and threatened to impose tariffs on another $300 billion of Chinese goods if negotiations continue to falter. On Monday, China hit back with tariffs as high as 25 percent on $60 billion of American goods, effective June 1.\nMr. Trump, cognizant of China\u2019s penchant for hitting where it hurts, said he expected Beijing to once again retaliate against America\u2019s farmers by slowing or stopping purchases of agricultural products, like soybeans and farm equipment.\nThe administration, which provided $12 billion in aid to farmers last year to mitigate the effects of the trade war, is developing plans for another bailout this year. Mr. Trump suggested this week that he will provide another $15 billion in financial support to farmers, potentially funded through the tariffs he is imposing on Chinese imports.\n\u201cOur great Patriot Farmers will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of what is happening now,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted on Tuesday.\nThe predicament facing farmers as a result of the trade war is grim.\nPrices of soybeans, pork and cotton all slumped this week after China retaliated against the United States. JP Morgan on Tuesday downgraded the stock of Deere, the farm equipment manufacturer, warning that the agriculture sector is \u201crapidly deteriorating\u201d and that additional farm aid would likely do little to buttress the fortunes of farmers.\nWhile Mr. Grassley supports the need to confront China, he made clear that the tariffs must go.\n\u201cI\u2019m no fan of tariffs,\u201d Mr. Grassley said. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed by the news of additional tariffs out of Beijing and here in Washington. Both countries are going to be hurt.\u201d\nGovernment subsidies are generally anathema to conservative economic orthodoxy. As Republicans grapple with Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policy, some Republicans have quietly come to accept them, while others insist that they only make matters worse.\nSenator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, told reporters on Tuesday that the proposed bailout sounds \u201cinadequate\u201d to deal with the problem, adding that \u201cit won\u2019t supply the benefit in terms of the demand and market share that a trade deal would.\u201d\nAmong the most vocal critics of Mr. Trump\u2019s plans to subsidize farmers is Senator Patrick J. Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania. On Tuesday he sharply criticized the White House\u2019s strategy with China, arguing that \u201cAmericans were paying the price\u201d of Mr. Trump\u2019s recent moves.\nMr. Toomey, who represents a state whose agricultural sector mainly relies on domestic consumption, called Mr. Trump\u2019s second round of payouts \u201ca handout\u201d that would saddle taxpayers with debt.\n\u201cThe term is meant to be pejorative because it\u2019s a very bad policy,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, think about what we\u2019re doing \u2014 we\u2019re inviting this retaliation that denies our farmers, the most productive farmers on the planet, the opportunity to sell their products overseas and then we say, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll have taxpayers send you some checks and make it O.K.\u2019 \u201d\nFarmers say that they would prefer free trade over government subsidies. But with exports of products such as wheat and soybeans to China drying up, they are willing to take whatever help they can get.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be needed,\u201d said John Heisdorffer, a soybean producer from Keota, Iowa, and chairman of the American Soybean Association. \u201cI hear from so many farmers now, how they\u2019re struggling.\u201d\nMr. Heisdorffer said that many farmers are feeling emotionally drained by the ups and downs of the trade negotiations with China and that he hopes Mr. Trump can find a way to roll back all the tariffs.\n\u201cAt this point, I still hear a lot of support for the president,\u201d he said. \u201cWe support what he\u2019s doing, but we felt all the time that there was a different way than tariffs to have done it.\u201d\nBut Mr. Trump thus far has shown little interest in changing course. Before boarding Marine One on Tuesday, the president described the economic battle with China as a \u201clittle squabble\u201d and said that the United States would win in the end.\nFor lawmakers such as Mr. Grassley, who espouse the virtues of free trade, the stubbornness of the squabble has amounted to growing frustration. The senator from Iowa said this week that he intended to begin sending his concerns to Mr. Trump in writing.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure if you talk to him face to face he hears everything you say,\u201d Mr. Grassley said.", "date": "May 14, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/us/politics/china-tariffs-republicans.html", "tags": "balk mulls \u201c farm farmers china aid grassley trump trade republicans tariffs"}
