{"title": "Anti-Semitic Crime Rises in Germany, and Far Right Is Blamed", "content": "BERLIN \u2014 Anti-Semitic crime and hate crime targeting foreigners each increased by almost 20 percent in Germany last year, according to official figures published on Tuesday.\nThe data includes a wide range of offenses, including assault, insults, graffiti, hateful postings online and the use of Nazi symbols. The figures are part of an annual report on politically motivated crime presented by Germany\u2019s interior minister and the head of its Federal Criminal Police Office.\nPolitically motivated crime in general continued to fall after a peak in 2016, and the number of violent offenses was down. The crimes that are still rising, however, paint a disturbing picture of Germany\u2019s resurgent far right, which the report found to be responsible for around 90 percent of the anti-Semitic offenses.\nWhen right-wing protesters marched in the eastern city of Chemnitz last summer, for instance, many of the slogans \u2014 and much of the far-right violence and intimidation that followed \u2014 were directed against immigrants, particularly Muslim refugees from the Middle East. But they were not the only targets.\nDuring the march, Uwe Dziuballa, the 54-year-old Chemnitz-born owner of the city\u2019s only kosher restaurant, stood unarmed in front of its door as a group of around 10 masked men hurled bottles, stones and a metal bar.\n\u201cWhat makes me angry about that night is that it has made me worry,\u201d Mr. Dziuballa recalled in a recent interview. \u201cI used to never worry about going out with this,\u201d he said, pointing to his skullcap.\nThe official report found that crimes nationwide against those perceived as foreigners increased to 7,701 last year from 6,434 in 2017, and anti-Semitic crimes to 1,799 from 1,504.\n\u201cEspecially in our country, we have to stand against this with all our means,\u201d Interior Minister Horst Seehofer told reporters at a news conference introducing the report. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to me that we bring the scale of this into people\u2019s consciousness.\u201d\nThe most cited offense, making up 39 percent of cases presented on Tuesday, is the use of illegal symbols and logos, such as the swastika. It accounted for 62 percent of all politically motivated crimes attributed to the far right.\n\u201cNobody should close their eyes to this further increase in anti-Semitism,\u201d said Josef Schuster, the head of Germany\u2019s Central Council of Jews, in a statement. \u201cThe citizens of this country, but above all the political leaders, must not accept that Jews are again exposed to a threat 74 years after the Shoah,\u201d he said, using the Hebrew word for the Holocaust.\nGermany\u2019s Jewish community has grown in recent decades, with 200,000 Jews estimated to have moved to the country since the fall of the Soviet Union. About 100,000 people now regularly attend Jewish services, according to the Central Council of Jews.\nA report released by the European Commission last year found that two thirds of German respondents think anti-Semitism is a problem in their country. Much of the recent reporting in Germany about the issue, however, has focused on anti-Semitism expressed by migrants.\nLast year in Berlin a group of activists, including Mayor Michael M\u00fcller, organized a gathering under the banner \u201cBerlin wears kipa\u201d after a 19-year-old Syrian refugee attacked a man for wearing a skullcap.\nHeiko Maas, Germany\u2019s foreign minister, expressed a hope on Tuesday that the new data would shift perceptions on the question.\n\u201cAnti-Semitism is not imported,\u201d he said in a speech. \u201cWe Germans in particular must remain mindful of that.\u201d\nMr. Dziuballa, the restaurant owner in Chemnitz, said that the growth in numbers might indicate a renewed willingness to take criminal complaints to the police.\nOther parts of the crime report were more encouraging, with a pronounced decrease in the number of attacks on asylum centers.\nThe number of politically motivated internet postings that break German law has also decreased since 2017, by 35 percent.", "date": "May 14, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/world/europe/anti-semitic-crime-germany.html", "tags": "anti-semitic percent report germany blamed rises \u201d crime politically last year right far"}
