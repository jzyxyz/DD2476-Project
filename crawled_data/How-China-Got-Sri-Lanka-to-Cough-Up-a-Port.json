{"title": "How China Got Sri Lanka to Cough Up a Port", "content": "HAMBANTOTA, Sri Lanka \u2014 Every time Sri Lanka\u2019s president, Mahinda Rajapaksa, turned to his Chinese allies for loans and assistance with an ambitious port project, the answer was yes.\nYes, though feasibility studies said the port wouldn\u2019t work. Yes, though other frequent lenders like India had refused. Yes, though Sri Lanka\u2019s debt was ballooning rapidly under Mr. Rajapaksa.\nOver years of construction and renegotiation with China Harbor Engineering Company, one of Beijing\u2019s largest state-owned enterprises, the Hambantota Port Development Project distinguished itself mostly by failing, as predicted. With tens of thousands of ships passing by along one of the world\u2019s busiest shipping lanes, the port drew only 34 ships in 2012.\nAnd then the port became China\u2019s.\nMr. Rajapaksa was voted out of office in 2015, but Sri Lanka\u2019s new government struggled to make payments on the debt he had taken on. Under heavy pressure and after months of negotiations with the Chinese, the government handed over the port and 15,000 acres of land around it for 99 years in December.\nThe transfer gave China control of territory just a few hundred miles off the shores of a rival, India, and a strategic foothold along a critical commercial and military waterway.\nThe case is one of the most vivid examples of China\u2019s ambitious use of loans and aid to gain influence around the world \u2014 and of its willingness to play hardball to collect.\nThe debt deal also intensified some of the harshest accusations about President Xi Jinping\u2019s signature Belt and Road Initiative: that the global investment and lending program amounts to a debt trap for vulnerable countries around the world, fueling corruption and autocratic behavior in struggling democracies.\nMonths of interviews with Sri Lankan, Indian, Chinese and Western officials and analysis of documents and agreements stemming from the port project present a stark illustration of how China and the companies under its control ensured their interests in a small country hungry for financing.\n \u2022 During the 2015 Sri Lankan elections, large payments from the Chinese port construction fund flowed directly to campaign aides and activities for Mr. Rajapaksa, who had agreed to Chinese terms at every turn and was seen as an important ally in China\u2019s efforts to tilt influence away from India in South Asia. The payments were confirmed by documents and cash checks detailed in a government investigation seen by The New York Times.\n\u2022 Though Chinese officials and analysts have insisted that China\u2019s interest in the Hambantota port is purely commercial, Sri Lankan officials said that from the start, the intelligence and strategic possibilities of the port\u2019s location were part of the negotiations.\n\u2022 Initially moderate terms for lending on the port project became more onerous as Sri Lankan officials asked to renegotiate the timeline and add more financing. And as Sri Lankan officials became desperate to get the debt off their books in recent years, the Chinese demands centered on handing over equity in the port rather than allowing any easing of terms.\n\u2022 Though the deal erased roughly $1 billion in debt for the port project, Sri Lanka is now in more debt to China than ever, as other loans have continued and rates remain much higher than from other international lenders.\nMr. Rajapaksa and his aides did not respond to multiple requests for comment, made over several months, for this article. Officials for China Harbor also would not comment.\nEstimates by the Sri Lankan Finance Ministry paint a bleak picture: This year, the government is expected to generate $14.8 billion in revenue, but its scheduled debt repayments, to an array of lenders around the world, come to $12.3 billion.\n\u201cJohn Adams said infamously that a way to subjugate a country is through either the sword or debt. China has chosen the latter,\u201d said Brahma Chellaney, an analyst who often advises the Indian government and is affiliated with the Center for Policy Research, a think tank in New Delhi.\nIndian officials, in particular, fear that Sri Lanka is struggling so much that the Chinese government may be able to dangle debt relief in exchange for its military\u2019s use of assets like the Hambantota port \u2014 though the final lease agreement forbids military activity there without Sri Lanka\u2019s invitation.\n\u201cThe only way to justify the investment in Hambantota is from a national security standpoint \u2014 that they will bring the People\u2019s Liberation Army in,\u201d said Shivshankar Menon, who served as India\u2019s foreign secretary and then its national security adviser as the Hambantota port was being built.\nThe relationship between China and Sri Lanka had long been amicable, with Sri Lanka an early recognizer of Mao\u2019s Communist government after the Chinese Revolution. But it was during a more recent conflict \u2014 Sri Lanka\u2019s brutal 26-year civil war with ethnic Tamil separatists \u2014 that China became indispensable.\nMr. Rajapaksa, who was elected in 2005, presided over the last years of the war, when Sri Lanka became increasingly isolated by accusations of human rights abuses. Under him, Sri Lanka relied heavily on China for economic support, military equipment and political cover at the United Nations to block potential sanctions.\nThe war ended in 2009, and as the country emerged from the chaos, Mr. Rajapaksa and his family consolidated their hold. At the height of Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s tenure, the president and his three brothers controlled many government ministries and around 80 percent of total government spending. Governments like China negotiated directly with them.\nSo when the president began calling for a vast new port development project at Hambantota, his sleepy home district, the few roadblocks in its way proved ineffective.\nFrom the start, officials questioned the wisdom of a second major port, in a country a quarter the size of Britain and with a population of 22 million, when the main port in the capital was thriving and had room to expand. Feasibility studies commissioned by the government had starkly concluded that a port at Hambantota was not economically viable.\n\u201cThey approached us for the port at the beginning, and Indian companies said no,\u201d said Mr. Menon, the former Indian foreign secretary. \u201cIt was an economic dud then, and it\u2019s an economic dud now.\u201d\nBut Mr. Rajapaksa greenlighted the project, then boasted in a news release that he had defied all caution \u2014 and that China was on board.\nThe Sri Lanka Ports Authority began devising what officials believed was a careful, economically sound plan in 2007, according to an official involved in the project. It called for a limited opening for business in 2010, and for revenue to be coming in before any major expansion.\nThe first major loan it took on the project came from the Chinese government\u2019s Export-Import Bank, or Exim, for $307 million. But to obtain the loan, Sri Lanka was required to accept Beijing\u2019s preferred company, China Harbor, as the port\u2019s builder, according to a United States Embassy cable from the time, leaked to WikiLeaks.\nThat is a typical demand of China for its projects around the world, rather than allowing an open bidding process. Across the region, Beijing\u2019s government is lending out billions of dollars, being repaid at a premium to hire Chinese companies and thousands of Chinese workers, according to officials across the region.\nThere were other strings attached to the loan, as well, in a sign that China saw strategic value in the Hambantota port from the beginning.\nNihal Rodrigo, a former Sri Lankan foreign secretary and ambassador to China, said that discussions with Chinese officials at the time made it clear that intelligence sharing was an integral, if not public, part of the deal. In an interview with The Times, Mr. Rodrigo characterized the Chinese line as, \u201cWe expect you to let us know who is coming and stopping here.\u201d\nIn later years, Chinese officials and the China Harbor company went to great lengths to keep relations strong with Mr. Rajapaksa, who for years had faithfully acquiesced to such terms.\nIn the final months of Sri Lanka\u2019s 2015 election, China\u2019s ambassador broke with diplomatic norms and lobbied voters, even caddies at Colombo\u2019s premier golf course, to support Mr. Rajapaksa over the opposition, which was threatening to tear up economic agreements with the Chinese government.\nAs the January election inched closer, large payments started to flow toward the president\u2019s circle.\nAt least $7.6 million was dispensed from China Harbor\u2019s account at Standard Chartered Bank to affiliates of Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s campaign, according to a document, seen by The Times, from an active internal government investigation. The document details China Harbor\u2019s bank account number \u2014 ownership of which was verified \u2014 and intelligence gleaned from questioning of the people to whom the checks were made out.\nWith 10 days to go before polls opened, around $3.7 million was distributed in checks: $678,000 to print campaign T-shirts and other promotional material and $297,000 to buy supporters gifts, including women\u2019s saris. Another $38,000 was paid to a popular Buddhist monk who was supporting Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s electoral bid, while two checks totaling $1.7 million were delivered by volunteers to Temple Trees, his official residence.\nMost of the payments were from a subaccount controlled by China Harbor, named \u201cHPDP Phase 2,\u201d shorthand for Hambantota Port Development Project.\nAfter nearly five years of helter-skelter expansion for China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative across the globe, Chinese officials are quietly trying to take stock of how many deals have been done and what the country\u2019s financial exposure might be. There is no comprehensive picture of that yet, said one Chinese economic policymaker, who like many other officials would speak about Chinese policy only on the condition of anonymity.\nSome Chinese officials have become concerned that the nearly institutional graft surrounding such projects represents a liability for China, and raises the bar needed for profitability. President Xi acknowledged the worry in a speech last year, saying, \u201cWe will also strengthen international cooperation on anticorruption in order to build the Belt and Road Initiative with integrity.\u201d\nIn Bangladesh, for example, officials said in January that China Harbor would be banned from future contracts over accusations that the company attempted to bribe an official at the ministry of roads, stuffing $100,000 into a box of tea, government officials said in interviews. And China Harbor\u2019s parent company, China Communications Construction Company, was banned for eight years in 2009 from bidding on World Bank projects because of corrupt practices in the Philippines.\nSince the port seizure in Sri Lanka, Chinese officials have started suggesting that Belt and Road is not an open-ended government commitment to finance development across three continents.\n\u201cIf we cannot manage the risk well, the Belt and Road projects cannot go far or well,\u201d said Jin Qi, the chairwoman of the Silk Road Fund, a large state-owned investment fund, during the China Development Forum in late March.\nIn Sri Lanka\u2019s case, port officials and Chinese analysts have also not given up the view that the Hambantota port could become profitable, or at least strengthen China\u2019s trade capacity in the region.\nRay Ren, China Merchant Port\u2019s representative in Sri Lanka and the head of the Hambantota port\u2019s operations, insisted that \u201cthe location of Sri Lanka is ideal for international trade.\u201d And he dismissed the negative feasibility studies, saying they were done many years ago when Hambantota was \u201ca small fishing hamlet.\u201d\nHu Shisheng, the director of South Asia studies at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, said that China clearly recognized the strategic value of the Hambantota port. But he added: \u201cOnce China wants to exert its geostrategic value, the strategic value of the port will be gone. Big countries cannot fight in Sri Lanka \u2014 it would be wiped out.\u201d\nAlthough the Hambantota port first opened in a limited way in 2010, before the Belt and Road Initiative was announced, the Chinese government quickly folded the project into the global program.\nShortly after the handover ceremony in Hambantota, China\u2019s state news agency released a boastful video on Twitter, proclaiming the deal \u201canother milestone along the path of #BeltandRoad.\u201d\nThe seaport is not the only grand project built with Chinese loans in Hambantota, a sparsely populated area on Sri Lanka\u2019s southeastern coast that is still largely overrun by jungle.\nA cricket stadium with more seats than the population of Hambantota\u2019s district capital marks the skyline, as does a large international airport \u2014 which in June lost the only daily commercial flight it had left when FlyDubai airline ended the route. A highway that cuts through the district is traversed by elephants and used by farmers to rake out and dry the rice plucked fresh from their paddies.\nMr. Rajapaksa\u2019s advisers had laid out a methodical approach to how the port might expand after opening, ensuring that some revenue would be coming in before taking on much more debt.\nBut in 2009, the president had grown impatient. His 65th birthday was approaching the following year, and to mark the occasion he wanted a grand opening at the Hambantota port \u2014 including the beginning of an ambitious expansion 10 years ahead of the Port Authority\u2019s original timeline.\nChinese laborers began working day and night to get the port ready, officials said. But when workers dredged the land and then flooded it to create the basin of the port, they had not taken into account a large boulder that partly blocked the entrance, preventing the entry of large ships, like oil tankers, that the port\u2019s business model relied on.\nPorts Authority officials, unwilling to cross the president, quickly moved ahead anyway. The Hambantota port opened in an elaborate celebration on Nov. 18, 2010, Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s birthday. Then it sat waiting for business while the rock blocked it.\nChina Harbor blasted the boulder a year later, at a cost of $40 million, an exorbitant price that raised concerns among diplomats and government officials. Some openly speculated about whether the company was simply overcharging or the price tag included kickbacks to Mr. Rajapaksa.\nBy 2012, the port was struggling to attract ships \u2014 which preferred to berth nearby at the Colombo port \u2014 and construction costs were rising as the port began expanding ahead of schedule. The government decreed later that year that ships carrying car imports bound for Colombo port would instead offload their cargo at Hambantota to kick-start business there. Still, only 34 ships berthed at Hambantota in 2012, compared with 3,667 ships at the Colombo port, according to a Finance Ministry annual report.\n\u201cWhen I came to the government, I called the minister of national planning and asked for the justification of Hambantota Port,\u201d Harsha de Silva, the state minister for national policies and economic affairs, said in an interview. \u201cShe said, \u2018We were asked to do it, so we did it.\u2019 \u201d\nDetermined to keep expanding the port, Mr. Rajapaksa went back to the Chinese government in 2012, asking for $757 million.\nThe Chinese agreed again. But this time, the terms were much steeper.\nThe first loan, at $307 million, had originally come at a variable rate that usually settled above 1 or 2 percent after the global financial crash in 2008. (For comparison, rates on similar Japanese loans for infrastructure projects run below half a percent.)\nBut to secure fresh funding, that initial loan was renegotiated to a much higher 6.3 percent fixed rate. Mr. Rajapaksa acquiesced.\nThe rising debt and project costs, even as the port was struggling, handed Sri Lanka\u2019s political opposition a powerful issue, and it campaigned heavily on suspicions about China. Mr. Rajapaksa lost the election.\nThe incoming government, led by President Maithripala Sirisena, came to office with a mandate to scrutinize Sri Lanka\u2019s financial deals. It also faced a daunting amount of debt: Under Mr. Rajapaksa, the country\u2019s debt had increased threefold, to $44.8 billion when he left office. And for 2015 alone, a $4.68 billion payment was due at year\u2019s end.\nThe new government was eager to reorient Sri Lanka toward India, Japan and the West. But officials soon realized that no other country could fill the financial or economic space that China held in Sri Lanka.\n\u201cWe inherited a purposefully run-down economy \u2014 the revenues were insufficient to pay the interest charges, let alone capital repayment,\u201d said Ravi Karunanayake, who was finance minister during the new government\u2019s first year in office.\n\u201cWe did keep taking loans,\u201d he added. \u201cA new government can\u2019t just stop loans. It\u2019s a relay; you need to take them until economic discipline is introduced.\u201d\nThe Central Bank estimated that Sri Lanka owed China about $3 billion last year. But Nishan de Mel, an economist at Verit\u00e9 Research, said some of the debts were off government books and instead registered as part of individual projects. He estimated that debt owed to China could be as much as $5 billion and was growing every year. In May, Sri Lanka took a new $1 billion loan from China Development Bank to help make its coming debt payment.\nGovernment officials began meeting in 2016 with their Chinese counterparts to strike a deal, hoping to get the port off Sri Lanka\u2019s balance sheet and avoid outright default. But the Chinese demanded that a Chinese company take a dominant equity share in the port in return, Sri Lankan officials say \u2014 writing down the debt was not an option China would accept.\nWhen Sri Lanka was given a choice, it was over which state-owned company would take control: either China Harbor or China Merchants Port, according to the final agreement, a copy of which was obtained by The Times, although it was never released publicly in full.\nChina Merchants got the contract, and it immediately pressed for more: Company officials demanded 15,000 acres of land around the port to build an industrial zone, according to two officials with knowledge of the negotiations. The Chinese company argued that the port itself was not worth the $1.1 billion it would pay for its equity \u2014 money that would close out Sri Lanka\u2019s debt on the port.\nSome government officials bitterly opposed the terms, but there was no leeway, according to officials involved in the negotiations. The new agreement was signed in July 2017, and took effect in December.\nThe deal left some appearance of Sri Lankan ownership: Among other things, it created a joint company to manage the port\u2019s operations and collect revenue, with 85 percent owned by China Merchants Port and the remaining 15 percent controlled by Sri Lanka\u2019s government.\nBut lawyers specializing in port acquisitions said Sri Lanka\u2019s small stake meant little, given the leverage that China Merchants Port retained over board personnel and operating decisions.\nWhen the agreement was initially negotiated, it left open whether the port and surrounding land could be used by the Chinese military, which Indian officials asked the Sri Lankan government to explicitly forbid. The final agreement bars foreign countries from using the port for military purposes unless granted permission by the government in Colombo.\nThat clause is there because Chinese Navy submarines had already come calling to Sri Lanka.\nChina had a stake in Sri Lanka\u2019s main port as well: China Harbor was building a new terminal there, known at the time as Colombo Port City. Along with that deal came roughly 50 acres of land, solely held by the Chinese company, that Sri Lanka had no sovereignty on.\nThat was dramatically demonstrated toward the end of Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s term, in 2014. Chinese submarines docked at the harbor the same day that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan was visiting Colombo, in what was seen across the region as a menacing signal from Beijing.\nWhen the new Sri Lankan government came to office, it sought assurances that the port would never again welcome Chinese submarines \u2014 of particular concern because they are difficult to detect and often used for intelligence gathering. But Sri Lankan officials had little real control.\nNow, the handover of Hambantota to the Chinese has kept alive concerns about possible military use \u2014 particularly as China has continued to militarize island holdings around the South China Sea despite earlier pledges not to.\nSri Lankan officials are quick to point out that the agreement explicitly rules out China\u2019s military use of the site. But others also note that Sri Lanka\u2019s government, still heavily indebted to China, could be pressured to allow it.\nAnd, as Mr. de Silva, the state minister for national policies and economic affairs, put it, \u201cGovernments can change.\u201d\nNow, he and others are watching carefully as Mr. Rajapaksa, China\u2019s preferred partner in Sri Lanka, has been trying to stage a political comeback. The former president\u2019s new opposition party swept municipal elections in February. Presidential elections are coming up next year, and general elections in 2020.\nAlthough Mr. Rajapaksa is barred from running again because of term limits, his brother, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the former defense secretary, appears to be readying to take the mantle.\n\u201cIt will be Mahinda Rajapaksa\u2019s call. If he says it\u2019s one of the brothers, that person will have a very strong claim,\u201d said Ajith Nivard Cabraal, the central bank governor under Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s government, who still advises the family. \u201cEven if he\u2019s no longer the president, as the Constitution is structured, Mahinda will be the main power base.\u201d", "date": "June 25, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/25/world/asia/china-sri-lanka-port.html", "tags": "lanka officials china port sri got cough chinese government hambantota rajapaksa"}
