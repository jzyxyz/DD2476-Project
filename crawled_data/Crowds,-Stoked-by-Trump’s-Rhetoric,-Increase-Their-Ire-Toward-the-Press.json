{"title": "Crowds, Stoked by Trump\u2019s Rhetoric, Increase Their Ire Toward the Press", "content": "The baby wearing a \u201cCNN Sucks!\u201d pin pretty much summed it up.\nIn the back of a fairground auditorium in Tampa, Fla., on Tuesday night, as President Trump presided over a rally dedicated to denigrating his enemies, the journalists dispatched to cover the proceedings attracted their own raucous crowd.\n\u201cStop lying!\u201d shouted a man in an American flag T-shirt, one of dozens of Trump supporters who hurled invective at the assembled press corps. Facing the reporters\u2019 work space \u2014 and away from the stage where Mr. Trump was set to speak \u2014 they flashed middle fingers and chanted \u201cCNN Sucks!\u201d as Jim Acosta, a CNN White House correspondent, attempted to speak on-air.\nMenacing the media was a theme of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign rallies in 2016. News networks hired security guards for some correspondents \u2014 a practice that, in Mr. Acosta\u2019s case, has continued \u2014 and reporters found themselves taunted and disparaged by attendees repeating Mr. Trump\u2019s refrain of \u201cfake news.\u201d\nIn Tampa, though, several journalists described an atmosphere of hostility that felt particularly hard-edge. And far from condemning these attacks on the press, the president and his team have endorsed them.\nThat night, Mr. Trump tweeted out a video of his supporters jeering Mr. Acosta, along with an approving comment from his son Eric: \u201c#truth.\u201d When the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, was invited at Wednesday\u2019s press briefing to condemn the menacing behavior, she declined.\n\u201cWhile we certainly support freedom of the press,\u201d Ms. Sanders said, \u201cwe also support freedom of speech. And we think that those things go hand in hand.\u201d\nNow, news organizations are anticipating an unnerving autumn, as their reporters prepare to fan out across the country for a fresh round of Trump rallies before the midterm elections. \u201cI\u2019ll go six or seven days a week when we\u2019re 60 days out,\u201d Mr. Trump said last week.\nThe president has recently revived his \u201cenemy of the people\u201d line about the mainstream news media, sprinkling the phrase into his public remarks. The new White House communications chief, Bill Shine, a former president of Fox News, signaled a tougher approach to press relations when he barred a CNN reporter from a public event last week in the Rose Garden. The reason? She asked questions of Mr. Trump in what the White House deemed an inappropriate manner for an event in the Oval Office.\nThe approach may appall some journalism advocates, but it has buoyed many members of the president\u2019s base. Sean Hannity, perhaps Mr. Trump\u2019s most reliable defender on cable news, directly addressed Mr. Acosta on Tuesday night at the start of his program on Fox News.\n\u201cThe people of this country, they\u2019re screaming at you for a reason,\u201d Mr. Hannity said. \u201cThey don\u2019t like your unfair, abusively biased treatment of the president of the United States.\u201d\nA montage \u2014 titled \u201cCNN\u2019s Jim Acosta Lowlights\u201d \u2014 followed, with footage of Mr. Acosta pressing Ms. Sanders at briefings and criticizing the administration\u2019s attitude toward the news media.\n\u201cThat\u2019s called opinion,\u201d Mr. Hannity said, when the camera came back to him. \u201cAnd you\u2019re extremely rude. Oh, and a liberal partisan hack. That\u2019s why Americans don\u2019t trust you and fake news CNN.\u201d\nPress freedom groups have long warned that Mr. Trump\u2019s rhetoric \u2014 and the accompanying criticism from his supporters \u2014 is endangering journalists domestically and abroad, particularly under autocratic regimes that have adopted his language in cracking down on independent journalism.\nThose concerns came up during a meeting last month between Mr. Trump and the publisher of The New York Times, A. G. Sulzberger, who asked the president to reconsider his use of the term \u201cenemy of the people.\u201d\nAfter that meeting was made public last Sunday \u2014 Mr. Trump, ignoring the White House\u2019s off-the-record stipulation, tweeted about it \u2014 the president opened a new flank of attack. He wrote on Twitter that reporters who reveal \u201cinternal deliberations of our government\u201d are putting \u201cthe lives of many, not just journalists, at risk!\u201d\nMs. Sanders picked up on that theme at her briefing on Wednesday, the press secretary\u2019s first question-and-answer session with reporters in nine days. (Ms. Sanders held only three formal news briefings in July, compared with nearly once a day in the early part of her tenure.)\n\u201cThe media routinely reports on classified information and government secrets that put lives in danger and risk valuable national security tools,\u201d Ms. Sanders told reporters, going on to cite a debunked story that a report about Osama bin Laden in the 1990s had harmed national intelligence efforts. (President George W. Bush has made the same claim, that a report about Bin Laden\u2019s use of a satellite phone had tipped him off to surveillance; the information had been released by the Taliban two years earlier.)\n\u201cIt\u2019s now standard to abandon common sense ethical practices,\u201d Ms. Sanders continued. \u201cThis is a two-way street. We certainly support a free press, we certainly condemn violence against anybody, but we also ask that people act responsibly and report accurately and fairly.\u201d", "date": "Aug. 1, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/business/media/trump-press-jim-acosta.html", "tags": "rhetoric news stoked reporters sanders \u201d trump crowds ire \u2014 toward press increase"}
