It was Mr. Trump\u2019s first presidential visit to American troops stationed in an overseas trouble spot.\nPlans for such a visit had been shared in advance with the government of Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi.\nStill, representatives from rival parties in Parliament said that the visit, which lasted three hours and did not include a face-to-face meeting with Mr. Mahdi, was an arrogant affront.\nThe most strident denunciations came from politicians affiliated with Moktada al-Sadr, the nationalist Shiite cleric whose supporters won the largest share of votes in parliamentary elections last May. Mr. Sadr has been an outspoken opponent of all foreign forces in Iraq.\nHamad Allah al-Rikabi, the official spokesman of the pro-Sadr bloc in Parliament, said Mr. Trump\u2019s visit reflected \u201cthe recklessness of the United States of America in its dealing with others.\u201d\nThe spokesman called on Parliament to \u201cplay its role and adopt a national, historical attitude and put an end to the frequent violations to the Iraqi sovereignty by the American government and to issue a decision to get the American forces out of Iraq.\u201d\nSabah Al-Saadi, head of the Reform and Construction bloc in Parliament, said \u201cthe holding of an emergency session for the Parliament has become something inevitable for the sovereignty of Iraq and to stop the reckless acts of Trump, who must know his limits because the American occupation is over.\u201d\nA statement from another parliamentary bloc, the State of Law Coalition, said Mr. Trump\u2019s visit was a reason to \u201crenew its rejection of the presence of any foreign forces on the Iraqi lands.\u201d\nMr. Trump said at Al Asad that he had no plans to order the roughly 5,200 American service members in Iraq to come home, unlike his decision last week to withdraw the 2,000 soldiers from neighboring Syria and about half of the 14,000 soldiers from Afghanistan.\nHe spoke from Al Asad by phone with Mr. Mahdi and invited him to visit the White House. Plans for the two to meet in person at the base were canceled for security and logistical reasons, according to Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary.\nA statement from Mr. Mahdi\u2019s office said the United States had \u201cinformed the Iraqi authorities of the will of the American president to visit Iraq\u201d to \u201ccongratulate the new Iraqi government and to visit the American military men.\u201d\nIt added that \u201cthe Iraqi government welcomed this request.\u201d\nAmerican forces left Iraq in 2011 but returned three years later at the Iraqi government\u2019s invitation to help reverse the Islamic State\u2019s rapid spread in the country, including its takeover of Mosul, once Iraq\u2019s second-largest city. But calls for the Americans to leave have grown in Iraq since the Islamic State was largely routed from the country last year.", "date": "Dec. 27, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/27/world/middleeast/trump-iraq-visit.html", "tags": "iraqi american forces want visit troops u.s. parliament angered \u201d trump lawmakers iraq"}
