{"title": "Nancy Pelosi- Trump's 'Hateful' Comments About Rep- Ilhan Omar Pose 'Real Danger'", "content": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) warned Sunday that President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201chateful\u201d rhetoric toward Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) creates \u201creal danger,\u201d days after some Democrats claimed she wasn\u2019t taking a strong enough stance against the president\u2019s anti-Muslim actions.\n\u201cThe president\u2019s words weigh a ton, and his hateful and inflammatory rhetoric creates real danger,\u201d Pelosi said in a statement.\nPelosi called on Trump to take down \u201chis disrespectful and dangerous video,\u201d referring to a misleading video the president tweeted Friday to his nearly 60 million followers. The video splices together comments Omar, a Muslim, made last month with footage of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.\nOmar, speaking to a Council on American-Islamic Relations event in Los Angeles on March 23, had condemned the increase in hate crimes against Muslims in the U.S. in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\u201cWhat Islam teaches us, and what I always say, is that love trumps hate,\u201d Omar said in her speech. \u201cNo matter how much [Muslim Americans] have tried to be the best neighbor, people have always worked on finding a way to not allow for every single civil liberty to be extended to us.\u201d\nA video clip of a small portion of her comments, missing key context, went viral last week after right-wingers shared it on their social media pages.\u00a0\n\u201cCAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something, and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties,\u201d Omar can be heard saying in a 19-second video clip taken from her roughly 20-minute speech.\nRepublican lawmakers and figures, either commenting before watching her whole speech or intentionally misleading their followers, falsely accused Omar of shrugging off the Sept. 11 attacks.\nRonna McDaniel, chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, called Omar a \u201cterrorist sympathizing anti-Semite\u201d and called for her to step down.\n\u201cIf it weren\u2019t clear *before* her unbelievable comments about 9/11, Ilhan Omar needs to go,\u201d McDaniel tweeted Wednesday.\nAll three \u201cFox & Friends\u201d co-hosts, Brian Kilmeade, Ainsley Earhardt and Steve Doocy, slammed Omar during their Wednesday morning broadcast.\n\u201cYou have to wonder if she\u2019s an American first,\u201d Kilmeade said, tapping into the Islamophobic trope that Muslims in America harbor \u201cdual loyalties.\u201d\nTrump joined the Omar-bashing bandwagon by sharing the graphic video of the twin towers in New York City crumbling to the ground during the attacks following Omar\u2019s comments.\n\u201cWE WILL NEVER FORGET!\u201d he wrote in the tweet that included the video.\u00a0\nMany Democratic lawmakers defended Omar against the bad-faith attacks against her, accusing Trump and their Republican counterparts of inciting violence against the Minnesota congresswoman.\nBut Pelosi, in her initial response to the attacks on Omar, appeared to take a middle-of-the-road approach, stating any discussion of Sept. 11 \u201cmust be done with reverence.\u201d\n\u201cThe President shouldn\u2019t use the painful images of 9/11 for a political attack,\u201d she tweeted.\nThe lukewarm rebuke from their party\u2019s leadership didn\u2019t sit well with some freshman Democratic lawmakers, including Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), who was sworn in alongside Omar and is also one of the first Muslim women in Congress, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).\n\u201cIlhan Omar\u2019s life is in danger,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. \u201cFor our colleagues to be silent is to be complicit in the outright, dangerous targeting of a member of Congress. We must speak out.\u201d\nOmar has been bombarded by GOP attacks in recent months largely over her criticism of the Israeli government. The right, and some of her fellow Democrats, view her rhetoric as anti-Semitic, though Omar has repeatedly noted that she is speaking out against a foreign government and not Jewish people.\n\u201cNo one person \u2015 no matter how corrupt, inept, or vicious \u2015 can threaten my unwavering love for America,\u201d Omar tweeted Saturday. \u201cI stand undeterred to continue fighting for equal opportunity in our pursuit of happiness for all Americans.\u201d\nEarlier this month, a New York man was arrested and charged with threatening to kill Omar, allegedly telling the FBI that he \u201cloves the president and that he hates radical Muslims in our government.\u201d Recent FBI reports show hate crimes against Muslims in the U.S. are at record levels. The rate of anti-Muslim assaults on American soil was 3 times higher in 2017 than in 2007.\nPelosi said Sunday that she spoke to the House\u2019s sergeant-at-arms to ensure the U.S. Capitol Police are \u201cconducting a security assessment to safeguard\u201d Omar, her family and her staff.\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Sunday that Trump wasn\u2019t trying to incite violence against Omar by \u201ccalling out\u201d her comments.\n\u201cThe president is wishing no ill will and certainly not violence towards anyone,\u201d Sanders told ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cI find what her comments to be absolutely disgraceful and unbefitting of a member of Congress.\u201d", "date": "\n04/14/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/nancy-pelosi-trump-ilhan-omar_n_5cb37f1ae4b098b9a2d553cd?2td", "tags": "pelosi- pose omar \u201d trump attacks comments ilhan pelosi rep- video danger said nancy"}
