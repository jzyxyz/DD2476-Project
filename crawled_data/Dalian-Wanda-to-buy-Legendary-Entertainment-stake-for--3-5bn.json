{"title": "Dalian Wanda to buy Legendary Entertainment stake for $3.5bn", "content": "China's Dalian Wanda Group is to buy a controlling stake in Hollywood film studio Legendary Entertainment in a deal valued at $3.5bn (\u00a32.4bn).\nLegendary is the maker of blockbuster hits such as Jurassic World, the Dark Knight Batman trilogy and Godzilla.\nWanda is the world's biggest movie theatre operator with a majority stake in the US chain AMC.\nThe rapidly growing group is led by China's richest man, Wang Jianlin.\nMr Wang has been looking to buy a Hollywood studio for several years and was reported to be in talks with DreamWorks Animation last year, but a deal was not announced.\nThe announcement, made at a press conference by both firms in Beijing, comes after a week of rumours about a possible deal.\nLegendary Entertainment chairman and chief executive Thomas Tull, who also started the company, will remain as the head of the studio.\nBuying Legendary Entertainment puts Wanda on the road to becoming a global media company and one of the world's biggest players in movie production. It already owns China's biggest chain of cinemas as well as cinemas in the United States.\nBut will it compromise artistic standards by leading to films which have to please too many people, including Chinese censors?  \nWanda's founder and chairman, Wang Jianlin, told the BBC that Hollywood films would have to adapt to the Chinese market if they wanted to succeed there: \"I think this is very normal because US companies want to grab a share in the Chinese high-growth market. They should do something to cater to Chinese audiences' interests \u2014 if they don't, there might be trouble\". \nThe new combined operation is making a movie about the Great Wall, featuring Matt Damon with Chinese director, Zhang Yimou. It's due for release this year. Legendary described it as \"the story of an elite force making a last stand for humanity on the world's most iconic structure\". \nBut the enlarged media company is expected to steer clear of any movies that might fall foul of the strict censorship of political matters in China.\nRead more: Hollywood studio buy-up begs questions\nWanda described the deal as \"China's largest cross-border cultural acquisition to date\". It is aimed at increasing ties between Hollywood and the world's fastest growing movie market, China.\nThe Chinese conglomerate said that Legendary's films have grossed over $12bn globally.\nMr Wang said he plans to pair the Hollywood studio with its in-house film production unit and make a stock market listing. A timeline for the launch an initial public offering (IPO) was not given. \nWanda had released its earnings report a day earlier and said that its revenue rose 19% in 2015 from a year ago on a surge of sales in its leisure and financial businesses.", "date": "12 January 2016", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-35289428", "tags": "world studio china hollywood legendary deal movie buy entertainment stake chinese wang dalian wanda"}
