Cohen plans to tell Congress on Wednesday that President Trump is a \u201ccon man\u201d and a \u201ccheat\u201d who knew a longtime adviser was communicating with WikiLeaks \u2014 and who implicitly instructed Mr. Cohen to lie about a Trump Tower project in Moscow that was underway during the 2016 presidential campaign.\nThe extraordinary testimony will take place when Mr. Cohen, the president\u2019s former lawyer and fixer, publicly appears before the House Oversight and Reform Committee. An advance copy of Mr. Cohen\u2019s testimony was obtained Tuesday night by reporters at multiple news organizations, including The New York Times, just as Mr. Trump began meetings in Vietnam before convening with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un.\n[Read the opening statement. Find what to watch for here.]\nMr. Cohen and his lawyer and adviser, Lanny J. Davis, did not immediately reply to requests for comment.\nIn a statement earlier Tuesday, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, condemned Mr. Cohen as a \u201cdisgraced felon.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s laughable that anyone would take a convicted liar like Cohen at his word, and pathetic to see him given yet another opportunity to spread his lies,\u201d she said.\nIn vivid and at times tortured language, Mr. Cohen plans to use his opening remarks to unspool a narrative laced with regret of his decade working alongside Mr. Trump, including episodes during the 2016 campaign that are believed to be at the center of investigations by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, and federal prosecutors in New York.\nThe testimony underscores many of the unsavory themes and stories that have recurred in public reporting about Mr. Trump \u2014 he inflates his wealth, makes racist remarks, threatens his enemies and tries to bend the law to his favor \u2014 but puts them on the record, under oath, in the voice of a man who was one of Mr. Trump\u2019s closest aides.\n\u201cI am ashamed that I chose to take part in concealing Mr. Trump\u2019s illicit acts rather than listening to my own conscience,\u201d Mr. Cohen plans to say. \u201cI am ashamed because I know what Mr. Trump is. He is a racist. He is a con man. He is a cheat.\u201d\nBut there are also more perilous claims that could further highlight Mr. Trump\u2019s potential legal exposure in the investigations that have already ensnared Mr. Cohen and other Trump associates. Mr. Cohen\u2019s testimony before the Oversight Committee will be his first in public, before Congress, but he has already spent more than 70 hours with Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigators and with federal prosecutors in New York investigating a scheme hatched in the run-up to the 2016 election to make hush money payments to a pornographic film actress who claimed to have had an affair with Mr. Trump.\nMr. Cohen and his account will be subjected to deep scrutiny by Republicans, who have already begun to hammer away with questions about his past business dealings and credibility. They plan to use Wednesday\u2019s hearing to paint Mr. Cohen as self-centered and untrustworthy \u2014 a man who ran afoul of the law, including by lying to Congress once before, and then once he was caught, sought to spin lies about his former boss to reduce his time in prison.\nMr. Cohen will address his own past lies head-on and plans to use documents to try to bolster certain claims. He plans to draw a picture of Mr. Trump using the type of nonspecific directives more often associated with organized crime bosses than with American presidents.\n\u201cIn conversations we had during the campaign, at the same time I was actively negotiating in Russia for him, he would look me in the eye and tell me there\u2019s no business in Russia and then go out and lie to the American people by saying the same thing,\u201d Mr. Cohen plans to say. \u201cIn his way, he was telling me to lie.\u201d\nHe will add: \u201cMr. Trump did not directly tell me to lie to Congress. That\u2019s not how he operates.\u201d\nMr. Cohen also plans to say that Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyers approved his testimony, suggesting that they signed off on him telling a false version of events to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees. Mr. Cohen is meeting with both committees again in private this week in part to correct those earlier false statements.\n\u201cMr. Trump knew of and directed the Trump Moscow negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it,\u201d Mr. Cohen will say. \u201cHe lied about it because he never expected to win the election. He also lied about it because he stood to make hundreds of millions of dollars on the Moscow real estate project.\u201d\nWhat Mr. Trump said to Mr. Cohen has emerged as a central question, after the website BuzzFeed reported last month that Mr. Mueller had evidence that the president had \u201cpersonally directed\u201d his former lawyer to lie about the project when he testified before Congress in 2017. Mr. Mueller\u2019s office called the report \u201cinaccurate.\u201d\nMr. Cohen\u2019s account under oath will state that something took place, but not that Mr. Trump made an overt directive.\nMr. Cohen will also tell Congress that Mr. Trump had advance knowledge through his longtime adviser Roger J. Stone Jr. that WikiLeaks would publish hacked emails that would damage his opponent, Hillary Clinton.\n\u201cIn July 2016, days before the Democratic convention, I was in Mr. Trump\u2019s office when his secretary announced that Roger Stone was on the phone. Mr. Trump put Mr. Stone on the speakerphone,\u201d his written remarks say. \u201cMr. Stone told Mr. Trump that he had just gotten off the phone with Julian Assange and that Mr. Assange told Mr. Stone that, within a couple of days, there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. Mr. Trump responded by stating to the effect of \u2018wouldn\u2019t that be great.\u2019\u201d\nMr. Stone, who was recently indicted on charges that include witness tampering and false statements to Congress, has denied to reporters that such a conversation took place. The recent indictment against him made no mention of such a conversation, but it did state that a senior campaign official was directed to contact Mr. Stone around that period of time about what material WikiLeaks had.\nAnd Mr. Cohen will reference a conversation he claims to have observed between the president\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., and his father, which he believes happened around the time of a planned meeting with a Russian lawyer promising \u201cdirt\u201d on Hillary Clinton.\nHe does not claim to have heard a direct reference to the meeting. Instead, Mr. Cohen will say, he recalled this event after The Times revealed the June 2016 meeting had taken place.\n\u201cI recalled Don Jr. leaning over to his father and speaking in a low voice, which I could clearly hear, and saying, \u2018The meeting is all set.\u2019 I remember Mr. Trump saying, \u201cO.K. good \u2026 let me know,\u2019\u201d Mr. Cohen will say.\nCNN reported last year, citing sources, that Mr. Cohen had witnessed the younger Mr. Trump describing the meeting with the Russian lawyer to his father. Mr. Cohen\u2019s lawyer, Mr. Davis, later said he had provided information for that report and that it was erroneous.\nMuch of what Mr. Cohen will say about the hush money payments he made at Mr. Trump\u2019s behest in the final weeks of the 2016 campaign has already been revealed in Federal Court or in news reports after Mr. Cohen was charged with a campaign finance violation for the scheme. But he will describe a surreal scene in the Oval Office, just a month into Mr. Trump\u2019s term, in which the president assured Mr. Cohen that reimbursement checks for the illegal payments were on their way.\nMr. Cohen will chronicle less legally dubious but unflattering encounters, as well, according to the prepared remarks. He plans to say that as a candidate, Mr. Trump directed him to write letters to his high school, college and other entities threatening them not to release transcripts of his standardized test scores.\nHe will claim that Mr. Trump asked him to put off reporters asking about his medical deferment from the Vietnam draft, telling Mr. Cohen privately that there were no medical records of the bone spurs that he has said affected his heel.\n\u201cYou think I\u2019m stupid? I wasn\u2019t going to Vietnam,\u201d Mr. Trump said, according to Mr. Cohen.\nAnd he will assert that \u201cit was my experience\u201d that Mr. Trump inflated his wealth to garner attention, and deflated his assets to lower his tax bills.\nMr. Cohen plans to describe his former boss as a jumble of conflicts, but one who is ultimately a dishonorable person.\n\u201cMr. Trump is an enigma,\u201d Mr. Cohen will say. \u201cHe is complicated, as am I. He has both good and bad, as do we all. But the bad far outweighs the good, and since taking office, he has become the worst version of himself.\u201d\nDetailing the hush money payments to the actress that Mr. Cohen was reimbursed for, he will state the affair as fact and will say that lying to Mr. Trump\u2019s wife, Melania, is something he deeply regrets. \u201cShe is a kind, good person,\u201d he will say. \u201cI respect her greatly, and she did not deserve that.\u201d", "date": "Feb. 26, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/26/us/politics/michael-cohen-trump-congress.html", "tags": "call testimony \u2018 \u201c stone con man trump congressional cohen cheat say plans congress campaign"}
