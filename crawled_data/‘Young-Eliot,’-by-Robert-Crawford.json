{"title": "\u2018Young Eliot,\u2019 by Robert Crawford", "content": "In an unheroic age, T.S. Eliot was \u00adpoetry\u2019s ideal antihero. Shy, indecisive, gangly, he essayed the Parnassian heights not baroquely turbaned like a Byron but buttoned down and gray-flanneled like a Walter Mitty. By day, he was a Lloyds banker in \u201ca four-piece suit,\u201d as Virginia Woolf reportedly described him; by night, a visionary poet, whose lyric fragments harmonized with the malaise troubling Europe after World War I. The Scottish poet Robert Crawford\u2019s assiduous \u201cYoung Eliot\u201d follows \u201cTom\u201d from his earliest poetic finger exercises to the \u201cineradicably insinuating music\u201d of \u201cThe Waste Land\u201d (1922), in which April cruelly breeds lilacs as well as a bramble of textual notes.\n\u201cSo many,\u2009/\u2009I had not thought death had undone so many,\u201d Eliot\u2019s dazed Londoner laments, in the borrowed voice of Dante, as sighing masses of workers flood hypnotically over London Bridge. The critic Paul Fussell saw in this image, from \u201cThe Burial of the Dead\u201d section of \u201cThe Waste Land,\u201d an endless throng of reinforcements mowed down by enemy guns, while others heard an elegy for Eliot\u2019s Parisian friend Jean Verdenal, \u201cmort aux Dardanelles.\u201d To readers who divined in the poem \u201cthe disillusionment of a generation,\u201d Eliot offered scant encouragement. True to his nickname, he played Possum, attributing to the poem little more than \u201cthe relief of a personal and wholly insignificant grouse against life; it is just a piece of rhythmical grumbling.\u201d Accustomed to his prim indirection, Eliot\u2019s romantic friend Mary Hutchinson recognized in it \u201cTom\u2019s autobiography \u2014 a melancholy one.\u201d\nAccording to Virginia Woolf, \u201cThere are some stories which have to be retold by each generation,\u201d in which case Crawford\u2019s reprise arrives right on time, \u00adalmost 30 years after the second volume of \u00adLyndall Gordon\u2019s watershed life of Eliot. (Peter Ackroyd\u2019s single-volume biography appeared a few years earlier, though with meager attention paid to Eliot\u2019s childhood.) The question for any biographer considering Eliot\u2019s formative years is, how did a 30-something expatriate from Missouri come to write the defining poem of his age? Crawford has done exceptional spadework in turning up clues that take us deeper into Eliot\u2019s symbolic landscapes, often rooted in childhood: Eliot ultimately felt that his \u201curban imagery was that of St. Louis,\u201d upon which that of Paris and his adopted London were \u201csuperimposed.\u201d\nCrawford concurs with Eliot\u2019s understanding that \u201cthe ways in which the \u00adpassions and desires of the creator may be satisfied in the work of art are complex and devious.\u201d Acknowledging that poems are not crossword puzzles to be solved or a \u201csource-hunter\u2019s labyrinth,\u201d Crawford judiciously navigates the maze of Eliot\u2019s impressions and experiences, making use of now available letters, extensive newspaper archives and annotations from \u00adEliot\u2019s personal library to shed light on both the life and work.\nEliot himself wanted no biography, \u00addestroying intimate correspondence, \u00adincluding everything up to age 26 and nearly all of the letters to his first wife, Vivien Haigh-Wood. As a result, Crawford employs a bit of indirection himself, extrapolating from contemporary documents what Tom most likely saw and heard as a boy. Crawford\u2019s careful reading of The St. Louis Globe-Democrat and other local documents turns up some fruitful leads: We learn that Eliot\u2019s quintessential shlimazl Prufrock shared his name with a St. Louis furniture store, while \u201cStetson,\u201d a denizen of \u201cThe Waste Land,\u201d may echo a visiting lecturer named Mrs. Stetson. Crawford charts Eliot\u2019s nautical imagery back to his youthful sailing exploits in Gloucester, Mass., and one is grateful to have the nameless shore of \u201cMarina\u201d (\u201cWhat seas what shores what grey rocks and what islands\u201d) identified from an early draft as \u201cOff Roque Island,\u201d in Maine. All biography relies on informed speculation, and readers can decide for themselves if Vivien\u2019s addressing Tom as \u00ad\u201cWonkypenky\u201d was, as Crawford \u00adsuggests, a reference to his sexual dysfunction.\nCrawford acknowledges Eliot\u2019s anti-\u00adSemitism as \u201cingrained in his society\u201d but has little to say on the subject. Other defects get more play. We\u2019re reminded more than once that Eliot was \u201chernia-\u00adafflicted\u201d and sexually awkward, but from these unpromising beginnings \u201cTom became T.S. Eliot\u201d: a Harvard scholar of languages and philosophy, an Oxford fellow, a Gauloises-smoking Parisian fl\u00e2neur and a friend of the Bloomsbury set. Like Henry James, Eliot achieved his goal of becoming \u201cfully European,\u201d an ocean away from his \u00adUnitarian upbringing. From the Symbolist poets Jules Laforgue and Charles \u00adBaudelaire, he learned the poetic possibilities of the \u201cmore sordid aspects of the modern metropolis,\u201d but it was his troubled marriage to Vivien that \u201cbrought the state of mind out of which came \u2018The Waste Land.\u2019\u200a\u201d\nEntered into without his parents\u2019 approval, the marriage began well enough \u2014 both enjoyed dancing \u2014 but faltered. Vivien commenced an affair with Eliot\u2019s former professor Bertrand Russell, while Tom grew close to Mary Hutchinson \u00ad(lover of Clive Bell, who was married to Vanessa Bell, Virginia Woolf\u2019s sister). Vivien\u2019s \u201cnerve storms\u201d eventually landed her in a nursing home, and Eliot himself sought psychiatric treatment in Lausanne. In 1921, Vivien wrote to a friend that \u201cTom has had rather a serious breakdown.\u201d \u201cThe Waste Land,\u201d completed the following year, came to Eliot as if \u201cin a trance \u2014 unconsciously.\u201d It is not hard to imagine the poem, with its cacophony of voices and spectral cityscapes, as \u201chaunted by a demon.\u201d\n\u201cYoung Eliot\u201d leaves off at a precarious point in Eliot\u2019s career, with a great deal yet in prospect. Still to come in Crawford\u2019s projected \u201cEliot After \u2018The Waste Land\u2019\u200a\u201d are his conversion to Anglo-Catholicism, his separation from Vivien, his editorship at Faber & Faber, his plays and \u201cFour Quartets,\u201d the Nobel Prize and his happy second marriage to Valerie Fletcher, nearly four decades his junior, starting in 1957. Also in store is Eliot\u2019s extensive correspondence (some thousand letters to be unsealed by 2020) with Emily Hale, whom Lyndall Gordon likened to Dante\u2019s Beatrice.\nBut in 1922, all was still inchoate and \u00aduncertain. \u201cThere is a small and \u00adselect public,\u201d Eliot boasted to his mother, \u201cwhich regards me as the best living \u00adcritic, as well as the best living poet, in England.\u201d\u2009\u201cThe Waste Land\u201d and the essays in \u201cThe Sacred Wood\u201d (1920), including the landmark \u201cTradition and the Individual Talent,\u201d would revolutionize poetry in English, despite small initial print runs and mixed reviews. Those who resisted Eliot\u2019s influence became defined by that resistance. Ezra Pound, who had shepherded \u201cThe Waste Land,\u201d attempted to raise enough money so Eliot could quit his job at the bank, but Eliot clung to the security of a salary. (If only he could have traded Lloyds Bank for Lloyd Webber and all of the posthumous loot generated by his lyrics for \u201cCats.\u201d)\n\u201cThe more perfect the artist, the more completely separate in him will be the man who suffers and the mind which creates,\u201d Eliot argued. Crawford shrewdly notes how \u201cTom selected the verb \u2018suffers,\u2019 rather than, say, \u2018loves,\u2019 \u2018exults\u2019 or \u2018experiences.\u2019\u200a\u201d Produced in the throes of great anguish, \u201cThe Waste Land\u201d offers little hope within its borders. Eliot\u2019s first half of life ended much as the world ends in his poem \u201cThe Hollow Men,\u201d \u201cnot with a bang but a whimper.\u201d", "date": "Aug. 21, 2015", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/23/books/review/young-eliot-by-robert-crawford.html", "tags": "\u2018 young eliot land \u201d robert vivien poem tom crawford waste"}
