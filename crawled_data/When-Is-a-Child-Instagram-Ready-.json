{"title": "When Is a Child Instagram-Ready?", "content": "In his first weekend on Instagram, my 9-year-old posted 20 times in 24 hours.\nHe put up a video of himself doing a front flip wearing only his boxer shorts, followed back every single user who followed him, and went \u201clive\u201d in a friend\u2019s basement without the parents knowing.\nIt was exactly what I wanted: We had the beginnings of our first set of rules. I typed it up, and we both signed it.\nI realize some might think I should ban him from Instagram entirely, but this was part of a deliberate strategy to teach my two elementary-school-age children to use social media responsibly.\nInstagram with my son is my first rodeo, but my 7-year-old daughter is already angling for her YouTube channel.\nIt makes sense. After all, my kids are digital natives: They\u2019ve never known life without connectivity.\nBut I worry that on their own, they\u2019ll become addicted, use social media inappropriately or be exposed to something they\u2019re not ready for.\nAccording to a recent report by Common Sense Media, my fears align perfectly with the top fears of parents of tweens across the country. The same report showed that, on average, parents of teens and tweens spend more than nine hours a day with screen media, with 82 percent of that dedicated to personal screen media, including about an hour of social media. Interestingly, 78 percent of us feel like we\u2019re good media role models for kids.\nSo, do I want my kids to do as I do? Not exactly. But I do want to be the one to show them around. That\u2019s the approach Sherry Turkle, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology psychologist, recommends.\n\u201cSpend some time introducing your child to social media, the same way you introduce them to your neighborhood,\u201d said Dr. Turkle, author of \u201cReclaiming Conversation: The Power of Talk in a Digital Age.\u201d \u201cIt is simply now part of parenting.\u201d\nTrue, but it\u2019s an intimidating part, one many parents of tweens feel ill-equipped for, because we can\u2019t look to our own upbringing to figure it out. Will our children become fame-obsessed and learn only to care about themselves, as some recent research from the Children\u2019s Digital Media Center at Los Angeles suggests?\nPatricia Greenfield, a psychology professor at the University of California at Los Angeles and a co-author of the study, said it showed that the more children engaged with the \u201clike\u201d culture of social media, the more they tended to have self-focused aspirations to do with fame, image, money and status.\nWhat can parents do?\n1. Have conversations\nThe more, the better \u2014 and include talk about taboo topics, Dr. Turkle said. \u201cThe social media talk\u201d is not so different from \u201cthe birds and the bees talk\u201d (and actually covers some of the same things). Kids need to understand what\u2019s out there, she said, and to know that they may come across inappropriate images, mean comments or people asking them questions about themselves.\nKids also need to understand what\u2019s appropriate for them to post. \u201cThey may know more than you do about technology, but they don\u2019t have the social context that adults do,\u201d said Sierra Filucci, executive editor of parenting content for Common Sense Media. This matters, because predators are more likely to prey on children and teens who have put up inappropriate things. \u201cVulnerable kids are more vulnerable to bad things,\u201d she said.\nThe goal is to create an open, positive family culture where social media is on the table as a topic of discussion. None of the experts I talked to for this article recommended using spyware. \u201cYou have to show kids that you are a partner in this journey and you are there to help them make better decisions,\u201d said Scott Steinberg, author of \u201cParenting High-Tech Kids.\u201d\n2. Create an agreement\nMy son is into gymnastics and loves watching \u201cflippers\u201d \u2014 teenagers doing double flips at extreme trampoline parks. He wanted to post videos of his own moves, so after talking about it I helped him set up an account. I wanted to make a contract together for using it, as most experts recommend, but first, I waited to see what crazy thing he might do that I would never anticipate.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good approach,\u201d Ms. Filucci said. \u201cYour contract should be a living document, not a one-and-done thing.\u201d\nI\u2019m glad I waited, because by the end of the weekend, I had learned the trouble spots \u2014 his frequent posts, inappropriate wardrobe choice and when to get adults\u2019 permission among them \u2014 and we were able to talk about what to avoid.\n3. Openly monitor usage\nOne of the rules was that I could unfollow or block people, but that he had the right to ask why. At first, I scanned his account constantly and unfollowed or blocked about 20 percent of his choices. But within a few weeks, I did it only once a day and edited very little. He learned quickly to look at someone\u2019s profile first. He learned what \u201cbots\u201d were, and that if he followed back accounts that were dedicated to selling things (like sports jerseys), the posts would clog up his feed. Only a few times did I see anything sexually inappropriate, which I promptly blocked and reported to Instagram.\n4. Be open to learning from kids\nOne benefit is that global connectivity is helping my son embrace global citizenship. He will happily connect with kids in any country, in any language, in alphabets I don\u2019t even recognize.\nI didn\u2019t grow up that way and I\u2019m proud to see him finding a place in the wider world. I hope those advantages can outweigh the greed for \u201clikes\u201d and fame found in the Children\u2019s Digital Media Center study.\nBut I also see the upside in those likes. My son has A.D.H.D. and often feels frustrated at his failures. But he loves flipping, and he is amazing at it. I let him use Instagram because I wanted him to connect with other kids like him \u2014 essentially to find his people.\n\u201cWe have a study that shows that kids who use social media do feel more connected to friends, whether it\u2019s friends online or ones they see every day at school,\u201d Ms. Filucci said.\nIt has definitely served that purpose, as well as being a creative outlet. I\u2019m enjoying watching him learn how to edit video, make artistic choices, and understand the copyright rules of music. Reading captions on his posts like, \u201cThis is my favorite trick to do off the mini-tramp\u201d gives me a little window into who he is that I may not have otherwise.\nYes, it\u2019s a little scary at times, but mostly, it makes me smile to scroll through his feed. Though I admit, I still haven\u2019t figured out what to tell the 7-year-old about a YouTube channel.", "date": "Feb. 21, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/21/well/family/children-technology-instagram-youtube.html", "tags": "instagram-ready kids media first parents \u201d social child children instagram"}
