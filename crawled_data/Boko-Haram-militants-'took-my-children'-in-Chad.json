{"title": "Boko Haram militants 'took my children' in Chad", "content": "Boko Haram has been driven out of most of its bases in northern Nigeria but in the past year, it has moved across the border to Chad. The BBC's Thomas Fessy met one family who have been devastated by the Islamist militant group.\nDjibrilla, 64, sits quietly in the corner of the hut. Gusts of dusty wind blow through the walls of reeds. Months have passed without a sign of life from five of his eight children. \nAged between two and 15, they were abducted by Boko Haram militants last year. \nWhere are they? How are they doing? Are they being forced to fight? So many questions he cannot answer. \n\"I can't understand even though I am trying to make sense of it,\" he says.\n\"I am so shocked, they are too young to defend themselves. I have to give it up to God, there's nothing I can do.\"\nThe five children were seized during an attack on their village. Those who survived the deadly raid, like Djibrilla, are now living in a makeshift camp. \nMany of these camps have sprung up between the sandy tracks and dunes that surround Lake Chad, which forms the border between Nigeria and Chad. \nPeople who lived on the lake islands were forced to settle in the desert, away from their fishing grounds and farmlands.\nBoko Haram fighters attacked their homes or they were told to move out by Chadian soldiers who fear jihadis may infiltrate them.\nChad, Nigeria, Cameroon and Niger are among the countries that have finally come together to form a regional task force to tackle the militants, who have staged attacks on all four countries.\nDjibrilla's community is obviously not receiving much assistance.\nIn this desolation, \"a day of joy\", as he describes it, eventually happened last September. \nTrucks from the Chadian army stopped by the camp. Soldiers were bringing his eldest son, Youssouf (not his real name), back to him. \nYoussouf, 26, had left home before his brothers and sisters were seized. He had gone to join the militant group of his own free will.\nBut he was not the only one. \n\"Men came to our village and told us we should join Boko Haram,\" says Adam (not his real name).\nHe is 16 and he spent two months last year with the group.\nHe is sitting on his left leg, holding his toes while he speaks. As he looks down, his face shows some kind of embarrassment. \nNext to him, Youssouf says: \"There was nothing to do at home and we were told we would get lots of money.\n\"We would get everything we wanted.\"\nMost young people in the region have not had any education, except at Koranic school.\nOn top of the state neglect, a devastating environmental shift has caused Lake Chad to shrink to a small portion of its original size, pushing families who depend on it further into poverty.\nThe lack of infrastructure, education and prospects has pushed many into the hands of Boko Haram, lured by the promised gold.\n\"The drying of the lake is creating socio-economic problems among young people,\" the regional traditional chief, Youssouf Mbodou Mbami, says.\n\"They have no activity and Boko Haram is telling them that they have money. So they go join their ranks.\"\n\"It has had a very serious impact on them.\"\nReturning from a visit to the region, the UN Regional Humanitarian Co-ordinator for the Sahel, Toby Lanzer, points the finger of blame in the same direction.\n\"The extreme violence is the most visible driver of instability and need for emergency relief,\" Mr Lanzer says.\n\"But the root of the crisis lies in the abject poverty and environmental degradation which has been plaguing the region for decades.\n\"It is one of the hardest situations I have seen anywhere,\" he says.\n\"The scale of the needs is simply immense.\"\nBack at the dusty camp, Adam and Youssouf describe fighters from Chad who recruited them, proof that the Nigerian insurgency has taken on a regional dimension.\n\"We were split into groups,\" Youssouf explains.\n\"Those who had been there longest were trained with weapons and they would gather to recite the Koran; but we were kept apart.\"\n'How I almost became a suicide bomber'\nOn patrol against Boko Haram\nSurviving Nigeria's Boko Haram\nBoko Haram 'paying recruits in Niger'\nWho are Boko Haram?\nBoth young men said they were under the watch of fighters wearing civilian clothes rather than uniforms, and carrying weapons.\nThey did not know how long they must have stayed before any training would start.\nUnder pressure from regional troops, the group was constantly on the move, travelling to different islands on Lake Chad. \nFor Adam and Youssouf, it soon felt more like a trap than a money-making opportunity.\nOut on the lake, it becomes clear that water is all that separates Boko Haram's stronghold in Nigeria from Chad.\nThe jihadis have been using boats to carry out their attacks, navigating between the many lake islands.\nFear is now ever-present, putting towns and villages on alert.\nIn the town of Baga Sola, local volunteers are manning a makeshift check-point at the entrance of the market. They have stretched a piece of string across the road to stop passers-by.\n\"We're like security guards,\" one of them says. \"We search everyone who comes into the market, and the cars must stop here so we can check them too.\"\nPeople seem to naturally comply with the new order as the volunteers pat them down for weapons.\nLast October, four suicide bombers made their way through the crowds and caused carnage in the market. Dozens were killed or wounded.\nThe community suffered another blow when they discovered that those who detonated the bombs were locals.\nMajor General Lo Adeosun, who commands the Multi-National Joint Task Force, has come to visit the troops on the ground.\nAdvancing with a folding seat cane in hand, privilege of hierarchy, he says they have forced the Islamist militants into \"splinter groups\".\n\"If you look at it on the grounds of insurgency and terrorism, you can see that the insurgency aspect of it is defeated,\" he says.\n\"But the terrorism, we are still battling with.\" \nThe soldiers have indeed retaken territory from the jihadis but Boko Haram still has the power to strike the nations around Lake Chad. They are vulnerable from within. \n\"The money never came so we found a way out,\" Youssouf says.\nThe Chadian army kept him in custody for a month after he surrendered to their barracks. Only then, soldiers took him back to his father.\n\"I was so happy when my son came back,\" Djibrilla says, \"but I warned him: you must stay with us even though we live in poverty.\"\nThe community that both Youssouf and Adam left behind has offered them a second chance but the terms are clear; they have their place and they must accept it.\nBut Djibrilla will not know peace until his five other children return home.", "date": "25 March 2016", "href": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-35882396", "tags": "haram militants chad lake youssouf djibrilla one nigeria says children boko regional"}
