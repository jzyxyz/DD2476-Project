{"title": "'Game Of Thrones' Director Tackles Unanswered Season 8 Questions", "content": "Heading into the final season of \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d fans already had a lot of questions. Well, believe it or not, Season 8, Episode 4, \u201cThe Last of the Starks,\u201d left viewers with even more.\nHow did Arya and Sansa react to Jon Snow\u2019s true parentage? What did Euron think when Tyrion addressed Cersei\u2019s pregnancy? Why did Jaime go back to Cersei when he just found out she sent Bronn to kill him with a crossbow?\nSo many questions and, thus far, so few answers.\u00a0\nBut, thanks to Episode 4 director David Nutter, some explanations are coming ...\nNutter has been with \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d since Season 2 and taken on some of the show\u2019s biggest episodes, including the \u201cThe Rains of Castamere,\u201d aka the Red Wedding. In an interview with HuffPost, he explained the reasoning behind some of the mysteries that still have fans scratching their heads.\u00a0(And if you\u2019re wondering why Jon didn\u2019t scratch Ghost\u2019s head, he answered that here.)\nIn the episode, Cersei (Lena Headey) tells Euron (Pilou Asb\u00e6k) that he is the father of her unborn baby for the first time we see on-screen. There\u2019s no 23andMe in Westeros, so Captain Jack Sparrow Euron buys it \u2015 having no idea that Jaime (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) is the child\u2019s actual father.\u00a0\nThey\u2019re one big, happy, murderous family for about two minutes until the army of Daenerys (Emilia Clarke) meets with Cersei at the gates of King\u2019s Landing. Tyrion (Peter Dinklage) tries to plead with his sister to surrender, begging her to do it for the life of her child.\nBut wait.\nSince Euron just found out about the baby, and he\u2019s standing right behind Cersei in the scene, wouldn\u2019t he question how Tyrion knew this information? That\u2019s what fans were wondering after the episode.\nFor Nutter, the scene wasn\u2019t really about that.\n\u201cI think Euron, he\u2019s not paying that much attention,\u201d Nutter said, explaining that the scene was more about Tyrion appealing to Cersei\u2019s softer side.\nApparently, Tyrion wanted Cersei to \u201crealize that she wasn\u2019t a monster at all, that she was really, truly a mother.\u201d\n\u201cThat was an intense scene,\u201d Nutter continued. \u201cI think any type of Euron intrusion there would\u2019ve weakened the intent of what we were trying to tell.\u201d\nThe true parentage of Jon Snow (Kit Harington) \u2014 that is, the fact that he\u2019s really the son of Lyanna Stark (Aisling Franciosi) and Rhaegar Targaryen (Wilf Scolding) and therefore the heir to the Iron Throne \u2014 has always been the core mystery of \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d So one of the most significant moments of Episode 4, and the entire series for that matter, comes when Jon and Bran (Isaac Hempstead Wright) reveal the truth to Sansa (Sophie Turner) and Arya (Maisie Williams).\n\u201cI need to tell you something. But you have to swear you\u2019ll never tell another soul,\u201d says Jon.\nArya swears it while Sansa kind of mumbles, but then, right before Bran is about to tell them the big secret, the scene cuts off.\nFollowing the episode, people were wondering: Why?\nWere Arya and Sansa happy? Sad? Angry? Mad?\nNutter explained that because the reveal had been done a couple times before for viewers \u2015\u00a0Sam (John Bradley) told Jon about his parentage in the Season 8 premiere, and Jon told Dany in Episode 2 \u2014 the siblings\u2019 moment was left out of the story.\n\u201cWe knew what Jon and/or Bran was going to say. What was going to come out of their mouth? Aegon Targaryen,\u201d explained Nutter. \u201cSo it\u2019s kind of wasted time.\u201d\nPerhaps the most talked about moment of the episode was when Jaime leaves in the middle of the night to go back to Cersei after having started an intimate relationship with Brienne (Gwendoline Christie).\nWhat\u2019s going on here? Is Jaime\u2019s arc over the last eight seasons just getting thrown out the window like Bran in Season 1?\u00a0\nWhile some have speculated Jaime is actually on a mission to take down Cersei and is just keeping Brienne in the dark about it, Nutter seemed to debunk that notion.\n\u201cI think [it\u2019s] this magnet. He\u2019s always running back to Cersei ... and he can\u2019t help himself. Too powerful for him to try to control,\u201d said Nutter, explaining how Jaime feels about his sister. \u201cAnd he needs to get back to her. I think it\u2019s the kind of thing where he\u2019s realizing who he is and what he\u2019s made of.\u201d\u00a0\nNed Stark (Sean Bean) kept the secret of Jon\u2019s parentage for years. Sansa seems to hold it in for only a few hours.\nGiven that she swears secrecy to Jon one minute and spills the tea the next, we asked Nutter why Sansa couldn\u2019t just play the quiet game a little while longer.\n\u201cWell, she doesn\u2019t say it blatantly, of course, basically inferred it, so I think that that\u2019s a moment that Tyrion has to put two and two together,\u201d Nutter said.\nExplaining more of Sansa\u2019s state of mind, the director said right now she\u2019s just trying to keep order in her house, with another battle looming.\n\u201cThat\u2019s her No. 1 thing, I think. Keep her family safe and her kingdom whole.\u201d\nThe \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d Season 8 promo, \u201cCrypts of Winterfell,\u201d was all about whipping up suspense by teasing the deaths of the Starks, showing Jon, Sansa and Arya staring at their own burial statues in the Winterfell crypts.\u00a0\u00a0\nAfter the teaser, a lot of people were wondering, \u201cIs Jon Snow\u2019s statue looking a little long in the tooth?\u201d\nIf Jon\u2019s statue did depict an older Snow, it could be a hint that he makes it through to the end of the story. So did Jon trade in his life as a Crow for crow\u2019s feet?\nNutter, who directed the teaser, said people are \u201creading too far into the statue.\u201d\n\u201cThat is not intentional, in any respect,\u201d he said.\nGiven the director\u2019s answers, it seems for now that Jon\u2019s fate \u2015 as well as the truths behind some other questions \u2015 will remain cryptic.", "date": "\n05/11/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/game-of-thrones-season-8-director-questions_n_5cd45cb5e4b0796a95d84ece", "tags": "cersei nutter think euron episode season director \u201d sansa jon questions tackles thrones unanswered"}
