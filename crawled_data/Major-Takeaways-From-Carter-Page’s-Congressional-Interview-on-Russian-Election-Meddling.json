{"title": "Major Takeaways From Carter Page\u2019s Congressional Interview on Russian Election Meddling", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A congressional committee investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election released a transcript late Monday of a seven-hour interview lawmakers conducted last week behind closed doors with Carter Page, a former foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign.\nSome details from the interview were previously known, including the fact that Mr. Page traveled to Russia in summer 2016, when he was part of the campaign.\nBut the interview revealed new information about who in the campaign knew about the trip, what Mr. Page reported to the campaign and other trips he took last year.\nBelow are excerpts and key takeaways from the transcript.\nMr. Page testified that he told at least four members of the campaign about his trip. Among the officials were the president\u2019s first campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski; Jeff Sessions, who served as a senior campaign official at the time and is now the attorney general; Hope Hicks, a campaign spokeswoman who now serves as the White House communications director; and J. D. Gordon, a foreign policy adviser.\nAlong with traveling to Russia last summer, Mr. Page went to Budapest, where he met with Hungarian government officials, including the Hungarian ambassador to the United States at the time, whom he had met that July at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland.\nMr. Page told lawmakers that for Mr. Trump, the trip would be similar to the one that Barack Obama made to Germany during the 2008 presidential campaign. Around the time that Mr. Page proposed the idea, George Papadopoulos, another foreign policy aide, was also pushing for Mr. Trump to travel to Russia to meet President Vladimir V. Putin. Mr. Page told lawmakers that he did not know that Mr. Papadopoulos was pushing a similar idea.", "date": "Nov. 7, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/us/politics/trump-adviser-carter-page-transcript-meeting-2016-campaign-russia.html", "tags": "policy carter election meddling russian lawmakers interview congressional last takeaways russia foreign page campaign major"}
