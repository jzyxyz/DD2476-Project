{"title": "Meet the Man Who\u2019s Been Spoiling \u2018The Bachelor\u2019 for Four Years", "content": "FRISCO, Tex. \u2014 A little more than a month ago, Ben Higgins, the warmly handsome star of the coming season of \u201cThe Bachelor,\u201d got down on one knee at the Sandals Royal Plantation resort in Ocho Rios, Jamaica, and proposed marriage.\nAt least, this is the information that, a day later, the blogger Stephen Carbone received as a tip from one of his many sources. A few days after that, after more reporting, he posted the scoop on his website, RealitySteve.com, spoiling the event \u2014 including the name of the winner \u2014 that will be the capstone of the 20th season of \u201cThe Bachelor,\u201d which has its season premiere on ABC on Monday and won\u2019t conclude until March.\n\u201cThe Bachelor\u201d is, ostensibly, a competition show with an unknown outcome, making this, depending on your perspective, the admirable work of a dedicated reporter or a shocking act of bad faith. But for the last four years, Mr. Carbone has been making a habit of spoiling the season for \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d and its spinoffs in their entirety before they even begin airing, making him the foremost authority on one of reality TV\u2019s signature franchises \u2014 and also a thorn in the side of its producers and network.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe I get this much information, every season. I still think it\u2019s weird that I get it,\u201d Mr. Carbone, 40, said in September at a Chili\u2019s 10 minutes from his modest home here, where he lives with his dog, Maddie.\nRealitySteve.com is combination love letter, cruel tease and cat-and-mouse game \u2014 one man working against a huge operation. Mr. Carbone\u2019s writing is characterized by equal parts skepticism and glee: The site\u2019s header reads, \u201cMy slanted, sophomoric, and skewed view on the world of reality television.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a small outfit \u2014 he employs a webmaster who also organizes his ad sales, but otherwise, all the labor is Mr. Carbone\u2019s, earning him what he terms a \u201ccomfortable\u201d six-figure income.\n\u201cI like writing,\u201d Mr. Carbone said. \u201cI\u2019ve always liked to write, and I\u2019ve always liked to be very sarcastic and very snarky about things. This show makes it easier, but if this show wasn\u2019t my job, would I watch it? Absolutely not. I wouldn\u2019t care.\u201d\nIn reality television, where events are filmed months before they appear on the air, there is a symbiotic relationship between those that serve up spoilers and the shows they spoil. Advance information stokes the interest of the most dedicated fans, who in turn help generate excitement among more casual viewers. \u201cThey know that I\u2019m free publicity,\u201d Mr. Carbone said.\n\u201cThe Bachelor\u201d is a competition in the sense that several female participants are fighting for one prize, but it is often more compelling as narrative drama than as a contest. On his site, Mr. Carbone spoils the particulars of who goes on what date, where they take place, and who is sent home, but he can\u2019t predict how the show will be edited for dramatic effect. You can know all the information posted on his site, but still find the show gripping.\nReality TV has, in essence, a system of sanctioned spoilers: events that are filmed in public, or information that pops up in tabloids, in unofficial concert with show producers and representatives.\nWhat Mr. Carbone does \u2014 rare in the world of reality-TV commentators \u2014 is give order to the porous ecosystem of nonlinear information. He scours social media for clues about the contestants\u2019 whereabouts and activities, aggregating information in plain sight \u2014 in one case this year, he sent a friend to a Las Vegas hotel to capture pictures of one of the dates \u2014 and relies on a network of sources who fill in his sketch of the season, piece by piece.\nRunning a show like \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d in the age of tabloids and social media means accounting for and trying to control myriad ways that information flows. Sometimes that\u2019s impossible, as with the most recent season of ABC\u2019s \u201cThe Bachelorette,\u201d when Kaitlyn Bristowe posted a video of herself with the winner, Shawn Booth, to Snapchat before the finale aired.\nThat was a shock to many, including Mr. Carbone, who had been informed that she ended the season single, and quickly had to revise his site. That aside, Mr. Carbone has a high batting average for accuracy. (For Mr. Higgins\u2019s season, he originally posted that the final dates would be in Greece, but quickly corrected himself when information about Jamaica came in.)\nMr. Carbone\u2019s path to \u201cBachelor\u201d omnivore was roundabout. Born in the Bronx and raised largely in Southern California, he originally pursued his love of sports radio, first as a play-by-play announcer for the basketball team at Loyola Marymount (he\u2019d attempted to walk on at Southern Methodist University, but failed) and as a regular caller to \u201cThe Jim Rome Show,\u201d a syndicated talk show. After writing his college thesis on Mr. Rome, he got a job with him, staying for a year and a half before moving on to work at a sports radio station. He also wrote for a paid sports commentary website, still a novelty in the early 2000s. Not long after, Mr. Carbone used obscenities in a column and was fired.\nA few months later, he found a new object for his ravenous cultural interest: \u201cJoe Millionaire,\u201d one of the first stunt reality shows, and ripe for mockery. He began sending caustic and humorous weekly emails about the show to friends, who forwarded them on, earning Mr. Carbone a reliable audience.\nTo make money, he took a job as a mortgage broker, and later worked with his father in the home bedding industry, all the time working part-time in sports radio. The email newsletter became RealitySteve.com in November 2003, but Mr. Carbone earned no money from it. That was still the case when he received his first spoiler tip: that Season 13 bachelor Jason Mesnick had dumped Melissa Rycroft, the woman he\u2019d proposed to on the season finale, and reunited with Molly Malaney, his second choice.\nMr. Carbone posted the information, and suddenly he was an authority. Within a year, he was regularly receiving tips, enough that with some elbow grease he could piece together the arc of a season before it began running. In August 2011 he was able to quit his other jobs. The people who provide him with scoops, Mr. Carbone said, aren\u2019t unlike the person he was when he used to call Mr. Rome\u2019s show: \u201cThey just wanted to feel a part of it, wanted to feel like they helped out.\u201d\nMost of his work is done before noon at home, sitting at his computer fielding emails and searching through social media for scraps of information. His work has had consequences for his personal life: He prefers to meet women through the site, and largely avoids dating people who don\u2019t know about his work. Being a single 40-year-old blogger, \u201cI don\u2019t think that screams marriage material when you\u2019re out on a first date with somebody,\u201d he said.\nMr. Carbone has been sued twice \u2014 the first time in 2011 after he emailed some eliminated cast members and offered to pay for information (the only time he\u2019s done that, he said), and the second time in 2012 when, just after settling the first suit, he spoiled the show\u2019s next season. (This suit was also settled.) He insists that he has never received information from people who work on the show. These settlements included an agreement that he would not contact the cast or crew of the show to solicit information. (ABC and Warner Bros. Television, which produces, the \u201cBachelor\u201d franchise, declined to make executives available to discuss Reality Steve or spoiler culture.)\nSince then, though, Mr. Carbone has largely been left to spoil unimpeded. Perhaps that\u2019s because his bark is worse than his reach. The post revealing Mr. Higgins\u2019s alleged choice has received about 280,000 page views, Mr. Carbone said. Last season, an average episode of \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d had about eight million viewers, suggesting that the subset of fans interested in spoilers is relatively small.\nMr. Carbone estimates that traffic to his site is much lower \u2014 about 80 percent to 90 percent lower \u2014 during the spoiling period (as the show is taping, from September to November) than during the actual season, when he recaps the show with signature cheek and also hosts a weekly video chat with fans. But even though his biggest traffic weeks are coming up, Mr. Carbone feels as if his work is more or less done. \u201cThis season was easy,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about being wrong.\u201d", "date": "Dec. 30, 2015", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/03/arts/television/for-the-bachelor-hes-the-thorn-in-their-tray-of-roses.html", "tags": "\u2018 \u201c information four show bachelor season man meet one years carbone \u2014 spoiling"}
