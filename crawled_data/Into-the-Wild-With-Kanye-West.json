{"title": "Into the Wild With Kanye West", "content": "JACKSON, Wyo. \u2014 One afternoon early last year, Kanye West walked into the living room of his California home and found Tony Robbins \u2014 the Hulk-sized, concrete-grinned motivational speaker \u2014 waiting for him.\nIt had been just a few months since the rapper, producer, fashion designer and cultural fire starter had gone through one of the most taxing periods of his public life: His wife was robbed at gunpoint, and a series of erratic concert appearances followed, culminating in a nine-day stint in the U.C.L.A. Medical Center. He was in a state of shambles, and it showed.\n\u201cHe could look at me and you know, I don\u2019t know why he mentioned suicide, but he could tell that I was very low,\u201d Kanye recalled in early June over breakfast at the rustic modernist home here that he\u2019s been renting and making music in. \u201cReally medicated, shoulders slumped down, and my confidence was gone, which is a lot of the root of my superpower, because if you truly have self-confidence, no one can say anything to you.\u201d\nMr. Robbins, who is known for his boisterous seminars that feature hot-coal walking, had been summoned by Kanye\u2019s wife, Kim Kardashian West, to stage something like an intervention.\nAnd so Mr. Robbins looked Kanye in the eyes and started issuing instructions. Made him stand up, get into a warrior pose and scream.\n\u201cI was so self-conscious about the nanny and the housekeeper that I didn\u2019t want them to hear me screaming in the living room,\u201d Kanye said. \u201cI think that that\u2019s such a metaphor of something for the existence of so-called well-off people that they\u2019re not really well-off \u2014 they won\u2019t even scream in their own house.\u201d\nHe was reluctant. But he screamed.\nThe fix wasn\u2019t instantaneous. \u201cI still felt self-conscious,\u201d Kanye said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have my confidence back.\u201d But it was a start.\nKanye\u2019s last two years have included wild stretches of chaos, public trauma, divisive flirtations with partisan politics, and health struggles that played out both in public and in private. Depending on the moment, he has been the subject of empathy, enthusiasm or scorn. For many, his embrace of President Trump and his controversial conversation about slavery with TMZ in May have been too toxic.\nCertainly, casual dismissal of Kanye has always been a built-in feature of his fame, but in terms of public perception, it\u2019s possible he\u2019s never been more radioactive. The world is now more skeptical and less patient. Over the past decade and a half, objection has tended to roll off him; now it\u2019s sticking.\nBut over two days of extended interviews that took place in his rented Amangani Resort home, on long walks through Jackson, and in lengthy car rides spanning eastern Idaho to Yellowstone National Park \u2014 edited excerpts from which are included below \u2014 Kanye was calm, measured, verging on beatific, and also self-aware and willing to reckon with the challenges he\u2019d created for himself.\nHe is still given to flights of conversational fancy and grandiloquence, but the Kanye of this moment is not the overeager attention seeker of the \u201cCollege Dropout\u201d era, the difficult aesthete who made \u201cMy Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\u201d and proclaimed himself the greatest, nor is he the stern warrior of the \u201cYeezus\u201d era, prone to interrupting concerts to deliver extemporaneous speeches.\nHe is, comparatively, pragmatic \u2014 attuned to his own limitations, mindful of the shifting pecking orders in hip-hop and fashion, interested in coexistence rather than conflict. \n[Never miss a pop music story like this one: Sign up for our weekly newsletter, Louder.]\nOver the past few weeks, he has worked on the release of five albums: His eighth LP, \u201cYe,\u201d and his collaboration with Kid Cudi, \u201cKids See Ghosts,\u201d as well as records by Pusha-T, Nas and Teyana Taylor that he produced.\nMuch of that music was made here. He\u2019s been coming to this area regularly since early 2017, a couple of months after his hospital stay. \u201cWe came here just for healing,\u201d he said earlier in the day. \u201cGetting my brain together and [expletive].\u201d He was medicated then \u2014 he\u2019d recently received a diagnosis of bipolar disorder  \u2014 but over time, he began \u201clearning how to not be on meds,\u201d adding proudly, \u201cI took one pill in the last seven days.\u201d\nThe night before, he\u2019d hosted a listening party for \u201cYe,\u201d flying in hundreds of fellow artists, coastal cool kids, and representatives of the press, radio and streaming services to eat barbecue and dance around a bonfire. After everyone who had been imported for the affair was exported back home \u2014 \u201cWe turned jumbo jets to Uber,\u201d he said, grinning \u2014 Kanye was taking a slow Friday. At Big Hole BBQ, the restaurant that had catered the event, he had a half-slab of ribs, wings, fries, slaw and beans, and washed it down with a Mary\u2019s Nipple, a vodka-lemonade concoction.\n[Kanye West debuts \u201cYe\u201d on a wide-open field in Wyoming.] \nAnd though it was almost two miles from the restaurant to the Movieworks Cinema 4, where he wanted to see \u201cSolo: A Star Wars Story,\u201d he decided to walk.\nThe day was bright, crisp, a little cool, and his step was brisk. He was wearing a black-gray-and-white flannel shirt, black Patagonia fleece pants, unreleased Yeezy 700s and an industrial-orange ski cap. His security was pacing him in a pair of black Suburbans, going slow in the fast lane, or slipping in and out of adjacent parking lots.\nKanye barely acknowledged them, though \u2014 instead he focused on the kids. Dozens of them. They ran out of restaurants and asked for pictures, or pulled their cars over to the side of the road, some of them blasting \u201cYe.\u201d The unplanned attention might have unnerved Kanye in the past, but now he looked pleased to be interrupted. And he made sure to ask what every single kid\u2019s favorite song was.\nThe Wyoming listening session was up there with the golden-era Kanye West exploits: an absurdist stunt, an immense display of ego and a genuinely new contribution to the rich history of hip-hop excess.\nIf it was baptismal, it felt doubly so given the few weeks that preceded it. Beginning in mid-April, Kanye returned to Twitter with gale force, posting a torrent of old photos, self-help-speak, cult-leader aphorisms, clothing-line updates and, most disruptive, continued amplification of conservative voices and doubled-down support for President Trump, citing their shared \u201cdragon energy.\u201d\n\u201cThere were people who said Trump would never win,\u201d Kanye said. \u201cI\u2019m talking about the it-will-never-happens of the world, people in high school told you things would never happen.\u201d \nTo his mind, he was supporting a friend and kindred spirit, and also speaking up in a way others wouldn\u2019t \u2014 as is his wont, generally.\n\u201cI felt that I knew people who voted for Trump that were celebrities that were scared to say that they liked him. But they told me, and I liked him, and I\u2019m not scared to say what I like,\u201d he said. \u201cLet me come over here and get in this fight with you.\u201d\nThe battle for Kanye\u2019s soul went into overdrive in the hours and days following his tweets. John Legend and J. Cole all urged him to reconsider his position. Kim instructed him to announce that he doesn\u2019t agree with all of President Trump\u2019s policies. When his father came to visit Wyoming for a few days, Kanye said, \u201cHe expressed that he felt that some of the policies were hurtful and that I\u2019m a person that does not intend to hurt people, never hurts people with intention.\u201d He added, \u201cI expressed the example that I have a cousin that\u2019s locked up for doing something bad, and I still love him, so I don\u2019t base my love for a person on if they doing something good or bad.\u201d\nIs there anything a person could do that is so beyond the pale that you would not support them, even if you liked them?\nI wanted to make my album cover the doctor that performed my mom\u2019s last surgery. I think that\u2019s pretty big on the cancel-culture territory. I\u2019m starting saying, \u201cI\u2019m not canceling him,\u201d \u2019cause the world canceled him. I believe in the court of public opinion that that thought has to change. \nDo you feel there is an expectation of you \u2014 because you\u2019re a successful black man in this country \u2014 to take on certain political or cultural positions?\nOh yeah, definitely. When I was in high school, most of my opinions were, like, only me and a couple people who thought like me.\nBut now you feel the pressure to speak for a whole group of people?\nNah. It\u2019s a rhetorical dumbass question \u2014 you could just say yes \u2014 but do you think there are a lot of husband-and-wife situations where the husband in the household liked Trump and voted on Trump and maybe the wife didn\u2019t, or vice versa?\nOf course.\nMan, I had my [expletive] [expletive] castrated: \u201cYou have to like Hillary. That\u2019s got to be your choice.\u201d\nThat\u2019s what the family was telling you?\nThe family meaning the world \u2014 because you\u2019re black, because you make very sensitive music, because you\u2019re a very sensitive soul, it was like an arranged marriage or something. And I\u2019m like, that\u2019s not who I want to marry. I don\u2019t feel that. I believe that I\u2019m actually a better father because I got my [expletive] voice back, I\u2019m a better artist because I got my voice back. I was living inside of some universe that was created by the mob-thought, and I had lost who I was, so that\u2019s when I was in the sunken place. You look in my eyes right now \u2014 you see no sunken place.\nWhen did that change happen?\nGetting out, learning how to not be highly medicated and, you know, just standing up saying I know I could lose a lot of things, but just standing up and saying what you feel, and not even doing a lot of research on it. Having a political opinion that\u2019s overly informed, it\u2019s like knowing how to dress, as opposed to being a child \u2014 \u201cI like this.\u201d I hear Trump talk and I\u2019m like, I like the way it sounds, knowing that there\u2019s people who like me that don\u2019t like the way it sounds.\nBut if he says something like he doesn\u2019t want to let Muslims into the country, do you like the way that sounds?\nNo, I don\u2019t agree with all of his policies.\nOrdinarily, public figures see microphones as natural enemies, designed to undo them.\nBut this is not how Kanye treats them. He speaks in long, jagged discursions, moving fluidly between subjects \u2014 saying he wished Bernie Sanders could have been Trump\u2019s vice president one moment, lamenting the awkwardness of a lyric about Tristan Thompson (the father of Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian\u2019s daughter) the next. He is in a constant state of self-revision. More than any other famous person of his stature, he shares his rough drafts.\nIf he\u2019d come into the public eye via technology, not music \u2014 if he were white, not black \u2014 Kanye might be viewed as a lovable, idiosyncratic futurist, not a perennial agitator.\n\u201cWe need to be able to be in situations where you can be irresponsible,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the great privileges of an artist. An artist should be irresponsible in a way \u2014 a 3-year-old.\u201d\nEven though this is the sort of behavior that gets Kanye labeled inconsistent, it is perhaps his most enduringly consistent feature. He is congenitally honest, almost shockingly unguarded in his speech. You can almost watch him as he lobs a new thought into the public consciousness, then stands back and watches as it\u2019s either embraced or swatted down.\nFully rendering his speech would require something akin to musical notation \u2014 markings to denote speed, spacing, emphasis, even the words\u2019 seriousness or lack thereof, or the percent to which he was certain of what he was saying as opposed to just trying a thought out. (Twitter is in some ways the medium least well suited to his thought process. He isn\u2019t gnomic, or pithy; he\u2019s roundabout, elaborative.)\nThis is, generally speaking, an approach incompatible with a media environment that ruthlessly records, dissects and parses each moment, examining it hard for flaws.\nThat hasn\u2019t changed Kanye\u2019s methodology, though. Not long after his April Trump tweetstorm, Kanye posted a longform video interview on his website with the acidic New York radio host Charlamagne Tha God. The setup was tasteful, all neutral tones. It showed Kanye at his most lucid and sharp, and suggested that perhaps smoother waters were ahead.\nOr not. \u201cI felt like it was something missing,\u201d Kanye said. \u201cI just had a gut innate feeling to go to TMZ.\u201d\nThe Kanye who appeared on TMZ\u2019s daily TV show is much more familiar: loose-tongued, provocative, searching. There was also a vulnerability that was easy to overlook, as when he admitted to having had liposuction. (By way of elaboration about the procedure, he said, \u201cAs holy as I am and all that [expletive], I still do some rich [expletive phrase] sometimes.\u201d) \nBut most crucially, and most alarmingly, he said that 400 years of slavery \u201csound like a choice.\u201d\nTo Kanye\u2019s mind, what happened on TMZ was a failure of language, not ideas. \u201cI said the idea of sitting in something for 400 years sounds \u2014 sounds \u2014 like a choice to me, I never said it\u2019s a choice. I never said slavery itself \u2014 like being shackled in chains \u2014 was a choice,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I went from slave to 400 years to mental prison to this and that. If you look at the clip you see the way my mind works.\u201d\nHe continued, delineating the path of many a Kanye West public conflagration. \u201cI think an extreme thing; I adjust it, I adjust it, I adjust it,\u201d he explained. \u201cThat\u2019s the way I get to it, but I have to push to, you know, the furthest concept possible.\u201d\nThe TMZ appearance essentially squandered all of the public good will Kanye had accumulated earlier in the day \u2014 except in the view of Kanye, who naturally saw the two media appearances as part of the same continuum.\n\u201cI think it was totally beautiful, both of them,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Charlamagne one was like the most beautiful funeral you\u2019ve ever been to, and you close the casket, and say this is done.\u201d\nAnd the TMZ one?\nAnd the TMZ one was the [expletive], the casket like [makes opening motion and screams] and the people in church is like [mimes shock and horror and shrieks] \u201cslave?!\u201d Ahhh! Ahhh!\nHow does it make you feel when you know an experiment didn\u2019t work?\nAwesome. I learned so much. I learned about the context of the idea of the word slave. I didn\u2019t take it in that context. I think that my personality and energy mirrors Nat Turner, or it had in the past, but that showed me that also that Nat Turner approach would land me in the same place Nat Turner landed, and that I would be legendary but also just a martyr. But I guess we\u2019re all martyrs eventually, and we\u2019re all guaranteed to die. \nTo clarify, do you believe that slavery in this country was a choice?\nWell, I never said that. \nIf you could say it again how would you frame it?\nI wouldn\u2019t frame a one-liner or a headline. What I would say is actually it\u2019s literally like I feel like I\u2019m in court having to justify a robbery that I didn\u2019t actually commit, where I\u2019m having to somehow reframe something that I never said. I feel stupid to have to say out loud that I know that being put on the boat was \u2014 but also I\u2019m not backing down, bro. What I will do is I\u2019ll take responsibility for the fact that I allowed my voice to be used back to back in ways that were not protective of it when my voice means too much.\nBack to back?\nWearing the [Trump] hat, because my voice is unprotected, and I believe that the black community wants to protect my voice. By me saying slave in any way at TMZ left my voice unprotected. So it\u2019s not a matter of the facts of if I said that exact line or not, it\u2019s the fact that I put myself in a position to be unprotected by my tribe.\nDo you feel that if black fans abandon you, that\u2019s something that you could come back from? Do you think that is a death blow?\nIt\u2019s not going to happen.\nIt\u2019s just not going to happen?\nLike I said, wouldn\u2019t leave. Like yes, got a bunch of different opinions. You\u2019re not always going to agree, but they\u2019re not going to leave.\nEarlier Friday afternoon, Kanye was in the back seat of the Suburban when he spied Victor Outdoor Seconds, a smallish purveyor of secondhand outdoor clothing in Victor, Idaho, a blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it town about 40 minutes west of Jackson.\nWithin a minute, he was fixated on the store\u2019s offerings: well-worn ski jackets, fleeces, snow pants and more. Nothing fancy or luxury, just styles so mainstream as to be almost vernacular.\nWhat Kanye saw, though, was pure Yeezy. \u201cI want to purchase a lot of stuff,\u201d he said to the store\u2019s proprietress. \u201cI don\u2019t know where I should put it, though.\u201d He settled on the floor, starting with a molehill pile and, over the course of a half-hour, turning it into a mountain. Later, the owner posted a photo on Facebook of 13 bursting-full white trash bags and a thank you to Kanye: \u201cBiggest sale EVER!!!!\u201d\nWhile selecting items, he got a call from Virgil Abloh, who was recently named the artistic director of men's wear at Louis Vuitton. Mr. Abloh was Kanye\u2019s mentee for years, the chosen son who broke free to make his own way. They spoke about the clothes Kanye was finding, about Drake, about the colors of the \u201cYe\u201d album cover. Mr. Abloh complimented Kanye\u2019s facility with earth tones \u2014 visual and aural \u2014 and gave Kanye his assessment of the album.\nKanye pressed Mr. Abloh for more: \u201cI\u2019m not canceled out the culture? People are listening to it?\u201d \n\u201cYou see me and Virgil\u2019s relationship,\u201d he said in the S.U.V. on the ride back from the secondhand store. \u201cI don\u2019t know what might have been in your mind, but there might have been some place where you wonder if those dudes still talk like that. And you saw, we do.\u201d\nWhat did you have to cleanse to get to that place, to be back at that rhythm?\nJealousy and fear.\nFear of what?\nLosing \u201cruler,\u201d \u201cking,\u201d \u201ccrown.\u201d And it was this thing where it\u2019s like O.K., you\u2019re not the No. 1 rapper, Drake\u2019s the No. 1 rapper, but you\u2019re the No. 1 with shoes, or this or that. And it\u2019s like yo, no more No. 1s. What\u2019s the No. 1 tree over there? Just be one of them. All of them are beautiful. If you cut one of those trees down, what would it be worth? Those look like $400,000 trees, just one of them, and look at how many of them are.\n\u201cYe\u201d is an album of deep vulnerability, Kanye\u2019s rawest since \u201c808s & Heartbreak.\u201d It reckons with the internal chemistry that causes mental illness, and with the real-life consequences of his public behavior. It feels immediate, an in-the-moment emotional reckoning delivered with the alacrity of a mid-2000s mixtape. Perhaps it is not surprising to learn that eight days before its release, Kanye said, he\u2019d had none of the lyrics of \u201cYe\u201d written. And he still went to see \u201cDeadpool 2.\u201d Twice.\nAt just seven songs, \u201cYe\u201d is less carefully constructed than the works from his most popular era. But it has familiar Kanye hallmarks \u2014 the scars of \u201c808s & Heartbreak\u201d and the soul-drenched production of \u201cLate Registration\u201d \u2014 even if the finished product has a far more unbuttoned feel than, say, the magnum opus \u201cMy Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.\u201d \nPerhaps the most consequential lyrics of this Kanye era are about mental health. On Pusha-T\u2019s \u201cWhat Would Meek Do?\u201d he declaims, \u201cNo more hidin\u2019 the scars/I show \u2019em like Seal, right?\u201d On \u201cYikes,\u201d from \u201cYe,\u201d he announced the bipolar disorder diagnosis. \u201cThat\u2019s my superpower,\u201d he scream-rapped. \u201cAin\u2019t no disability/I\u2019m a superhero! I\u2019m a superhero!\u201d\nAnd on the \u201cYe\u201d opener, \u201cI Thought About Killing You,\u201d the clouds get darker: \u201cToday I thought about killing you, premeditated murder/I think about killing myself/And I, I love myself way more than I love you.\u201d\nOn \u201cI Thought About Killing You,\u201d to what degree is that literal and to what degree is that metaphor? \nOh yeah, I\u2019ve thought about killing myself all the time. It\u2019s always a option and [expletive]. Like Louis C.K. said: I flip through the manual. I weigh all the options.\nLater, he added: \u201cI\u2019m just having this epiphany now, \u2019cause I didn\u2019t do it, but I did think it all the way through. But if I didn\u2019t think it all the way through, then it\u2019s actually maybe more of a chance of it happening.\u201d\n The following morning, Kanye arrived in the dining area for breakfast around 10 a.m., wearing a red hoodie over a long-sleeved gray Calabasas T-shirt. His personal chef brought him his plate, showing him a slip of paper with the meal\u2019s nutritional information before he dug in.\n\u201cDid you see my tweet?\u201d he asked. Overnight, he\u2019d sent out a missive putting an end to the reignited feud between Pusha-T and Drake, in so much as someone who was not one of the primary participants can do that.\nFriction between Kanye and Drake has replaced friction between Kanye and Jay-Z as hip-hop\u2019s central Oedipal drama even if at this point the two are, for all intents and purposes, peers. (At one point, they were recording music for a possible collaborative album.)\nBut then Pusha-T and Drake got to quarreling, and on \u201cDuppy Freestyle,\u201d Drake took aim at Kanye, saying he\u2019d written for him and \u201clet him repeat.\u201d Yes, Drake had written on \u201cThe Life of Pablo,\u201d which was not a secret. And as it happens, he wrote for Kanye on \u201cYe\u201d as well \u2014 the hook for \u201cYikes\u201d is his. (He also wrote a whole first verse, Kanye said, though it didn\u2019t make the final album.)\nThis acknowledgment is a shock for those who still see hip-hop as one kind of auteur music, the sort in which the vocalist is relating true-life tales, unembellished and autobiographical, and not the other kind of auteur music, in which one figurehead orchestrates a creative enterprise, drawing on a wide and deep range of talent in search of completing a complex but coherent puzzle. \nKanye has long worked with songwriters \u2014 something that, because it\u2019s perceived as heterodoxy, is rarely discussed openly. In this moment of increased transparency, though, he\u2019s become Zen about sharing the details.\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredible how we just sit there and just think and rethink and rewrite and rewrite and rewrite,\u201d he said of his studio sessions. \u201cWe\u2019re not pulling off a magic trick here. We\u2019re like Tesla, we\u2019re not \u2018The Prestige.\u2019\u201d\nHis initial approach to a beat is melodic and rhythmic, finding a cadence that suits his voice, an energy level at which the vocals will be delivered, and maybe a rhyme scheme. From there, he colors in the outlines, bouncing ideas back and forth with any number of writers.\nSince leaving the hospital, Kanye had been compiling notes about his experiences and feelings. For \u201cYe,\u201d he turned them over to various writers, so that they might help put structure to the thoughts.\nMany are people he\u2019s worked with for years and trusts implicitly. CyHi the Prynce is, he said, the best at finding those shapes. The line on \u201cAll Mine\u201d about Stormy Daniels, that came from Consequence. \u201cSometimes I take all the shine/talk like I drank all the wine,\u201d on \u201cGhost Town,\u201d was contributed by Malik Yusef.\nAfter hearing Cardi B rap \u201cI gotta stay out of Gucci/I\u2019m finna run out of hangers\u201d on her song \u201cDrip,\u201d Kanye tracked down her co-writer, Pardison Fontaine, and brought him to Wyoming: \u201cI was just like, that\u2019s something that I would have thought of and would like to say.\u201d\nIn the same way the clothes in the secondhand store struck Kanye as very Yeezy, the same goes for other rappers\u2019 words and flows. And like the clothes, he chooses freely among them for inspiration, building his public, creative self from all the parts available to him. He even cited the way Tony Robbins delivers his messages as a songwriting inspiration. \n\u201cThis is a really interesting moment,\u201d he said of discussing this process openly. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a controversial moment, right?\u201d\nBy this point in the day, breakfast was far in the rear view and Kanye was back in the Suburban, enjoying another day of relative calm. He\u2019d directed his driver north on Route 191, into Grand Teton National Park, driving past the same mountains that appear in the iPhone photo he shot for the cover of \u201cYe.\u201d\nJumping out of the car at a rest stop, he said, \u201cI hope they got a fresh-ass T-shirt.\u201d They don\u2019t, but he buys some small toys for his children, and stocks up on Doritos and jerky for the road.\nAs the Suburban pushed onward into Yellowstone National Park, he tried to call Kim, but reception was bad and he couldn\u2019t get through. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to tell my girl I\u2019m going to Yellowstone, \u2019cause we never did it,\u201d he said. A few minutes later, he added with a shrug, \u201cI\u2019m not going to lie, it looks the same as where we stay.\u201d\nIf there has been a corrective force during this tumultuous period, it\u2019s been Kim, whom Kanye married in 2014. They now have three children: 5-year-old North; 2-year-old Saint and 5-month-old Chicago. Their lives and businesses are symbiotic. She flew to Wyoming to celebrate at the ranch with Kanye, and over the next two days, they checked in regularly by phone. At one point, she sent him a video of North singing the chorus of \u201cNo Mistakes,\u201d and he watched it dozens of times, ignoring everyone in the room.\nOne of the most affecting songs on \u201cYe\u201d is \u201cWouldn\u2019t Leave,\u201d in which Kanye suggests that his TMZ appearance put his marriage at risk.\n\u201cThere was a moment where I felt like after TMZ, maybe a week after that, I felt like the energy levels were low, and I called different family members and was asking, you know, \u2018Was Kim thinking about leaving me after TMZ?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cSo that was a real conversation.\u201d\nLike many of the songs on \u201cYe,\u201d this one functions as both personal and professional, micro and macro, individual and universal. Kanye is serenading not just his wife, but also the fans who stuck by him during this most trying period.\nOr as he put it on \u201cNo Mistakes,\u201d \u201cFor all my dogs that stayed down, we up again.\u201d\nStaying down, he understands, has not been a given. \u201cHalf that audience that was there last night, half the people that are listening to the album are supposed to not listen to the album right now,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m canceled. I\u2019m canceled because I didn\u2019t cancel Trump.\u201d (On a call earlier in the day with Khlo\u00e9, he acknowledged the challenge: \u201cI set the video game on the hardest setting possible, the most hate possible.\u201d) \nAnd yet \u201cYe\u201d still debuted at the top of the Billboard album chart. That underscores the real tension endemic to contemporary cancel culture: It\u2019s possible to be canceled and thrive at the same time.\nGetting comfortable with the dissonance, that\u2019s the thing. For someone who spent the whole of his early career in conquer mode, constantly questioning anyone who doubted him, accepting that you can\u2019t always control your own narrative is a kind of growth. Along the way, there will be missteps, setbacks, even upheavals. The healthiest choice, Kanye has discovered, is to learn from them, accept them and absorb them into who he\u2019s becoming.\n\u201cMy existence is selvage denim at this point, it\u2019s a vintage Herm\u00e8s bag,\u201d Kanye said. \u201cAll the stains just make it better.\u201d", "date": "June 25, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/25/arts/music/kanye-west-ye-interview.html", "tags": "way kanye wild \u201d one back west ye like \u2014"}
