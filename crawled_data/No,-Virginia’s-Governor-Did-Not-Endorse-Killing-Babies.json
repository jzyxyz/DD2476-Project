{"title": "No, Virginia\u2019s Governor Did Not Endorse Killing Babies", "content": "Conservatives whipped themselves into a frenzy this week after Virginia\u2019s Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam explained his support of a late-term abortion bill in his state\u2019s legislature.\u00a0\n\u201cI never thought I would see the day America had government officials who openly support legal infanticide,\u201d Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said Wednesday over Twitter.\u00a0\n\u201cThe modern Democratic party\u2019s embrace of late-term (or post-birth) abortion is truly tragic,\u201d Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said in a tweet of his own.\u00a0\n\u201cThis is horrific,\u201d Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel wrote, incorrectly stating that Northam defended what she called \u201cborn-alive abortions.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s really no way around this: it\u2019s murder,\u201d tweeted Caleb Hull, a conservative marketing professional who shared a popular \u2014 but misleading \u2014 video clip of Northam\u2019s comments.\nHere\u2019s what the fuss is about:\nThe Virginia bill \u2015 which is not likely to pass the state\u2019s Republican-controlled House and has been tabled \u2015 would loosen abortion restrictions there.\nCurrently, late-term abortions are legal in Virginia only under strict circumstances. The measure introduced by state Rep. Kathy Tran, a Democrat, would remove language requiring that a pregnancy\u2019s risk to the mother be \u201csubstantial and irremediable.\u201d The proposal would also change the number of doctors required to sign off on a late-term abortion, from three to one, provided that it is performed in a licensed hospital and that not doing so would \u201cimpair the mental or physical health\u201d of the mother or result in her death.\u00a0\nThe law would apply up to \u2015 but not including \u2015 birth.\u00a0\nTran is seen acknowledging this point in a video held up by conservatives as evidence of cruelty. But the controversy really started spreading after Northam went on WTOP, a local radio station, and spoke about it.\u00a0\nThe governor, a pediatric neurologist, stressed that late-term abortions were done with the consent of the women and their doctors.\u00a0\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s done in cases where there may be severe deformities. There may be a fetus that\u2019s nonviable,\u201d Northam said.\n\u201cSo in this particular example, if a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen,\u201d he went on. \u201cThe infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that\u2019s what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.\u201d\nNortham was describing end-of-life care in a painful circumstance, as his office said in a clarifying statement, not murder.\u00a0\nThe bill\u00a0clearly states that life support \u201cshall be available and utilized if there is any clearly visible evidence of viability.\u201d Third-trimester abortions are rare in the U.S., where the vast majority of the procedures \u2015 about 92 percent, according to Planned Parenthood \u2015 are performed in the first trimester.\u00a0\nYet Northam\u2019s response has been used as ammunition by opponents of abortion such as Rubio, Cruz, McDaniel and those in the White House.\nPresident Donald Trump responded to the controversy in an interview with The Daily Caller published Thursday, calling the proposal \u201cterrible.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised that he did that,\u201d Trump said about Northam. \u201cI\u2019ve met him a number of times.\u201d\nVice President Mike Pence similarly decried the Virginia legislation and another abortion bill recently passed in New York, where women can now opt to terminate a pregnancy at any time if their health is at risk.\u00a0\n\u201cIt would be unconscionable for us to let this moment pass in silence,\u201d\u00a0Pence wrote on Twitter.\nThe president appears to agree.\u00a0\n\u201cI think this is going to lift up the whole pro-life movement like maybe it\u2019s never been lifted before,\u201d Trump told The Daily Caller.\u00a0\nAsked by a reporter whether he regretted his comments on WTOP, in light of prominent conservatives\u2019 responses,\u00a0Northam said no.\n\u201cI\u2019m a physician. I\u2019m also the governor. But when I\u2019m asked questions, a lot of the time it is put in the context of being a physician,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI regret that those comments have been mischaracterized,\u201d Northam said.\u00a0\nThis story has been updated to include further comments from Ralph Northam.", "date": "\n01/31/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/virginia-governor-ralph-northam-late-term-abortion_n_5c534527e4b043e25b1a5cb3", "tags": "virginia babies \u201d \u2015 killing northam abortion late-term bill governor endorse"}
