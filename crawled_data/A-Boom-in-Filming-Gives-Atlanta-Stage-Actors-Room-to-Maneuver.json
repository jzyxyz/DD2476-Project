{"title": "A Boom in Filming Gives Atlanta Stage Actors Room to Maneuver", "content": "ATLANTA \u2014 Danielle Deadwyler dreamed of being an actress, but in 2008 when she was a teaching assistant at a charter school, it seemed like an impossibility. Yes, the theater scene here was budding, but film and television opportunities were few and far between.\nStill, she took a chance. She landed a role in a production of \u201cFor Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow Is Enuf\u201d at Kenny Leon\u2019s True Colors Theater Company. That was all the confirmation she needed to make acting her life\u2019s work, even if the way forward was unclear.\nFast forward a decade, and Ms. Deadwyler is juggling roles and auditions for both stage and screen, while developing her passion projects. Like many of her fellow performers, she can thank the huge increase in movie and television filming in Georgia.\nShe\u2019s LaQuita \u201cQuita\u201d Maxwell on Tyler Perry\u2019s \u201cThe Haves and the Have Nots,\u201d the crazy sister of the actress Tika Sumpter\u2019s character\u2019s even crazier ex-boyfriend. It\u2019s not a big role, but during the show\u2019s five-years-and-counting run, it has allowed her to remain a fixture on the local theater scene while exposing her to casting opportunities on many other projects being shot in the state, and beyond.\nIn the last few years she\u2019s been in the Pulitzer Prize-winning play \u201cClybourne Park\u201d at Aurora Theater, in nearby Lawrenceville; portrayed an actress injured doing Shakespeare in \u201cSmart People\u201d at True Colors; and played multiple roles in \u201cThe Temple Bombing,\u201d at the Alliance Theater, one of her regular acting homes.\nShe also received a fellowship to produce a series of performance art pieces about the ways women\u2019s bodies are used for labor.\n\u201cAtlanta\u2019s film and television swell has enabled me to practice my craft in multiple mediums right at home,\u201d said Ms. Deadwyler, who also has appeared in \u201cGreenleaf\u201d on the Oprah Winfrey Network.\nIt was practically impossible to make a full-time living as an actor in Atlanta, and performers often had to travel to New York for regional theater, television and film auditions. But in 2008, everything changed. The governor signed a new tax law, allowing for up to 30 percent of Georgia production spending to be transferred into tax credits.\nEverything from recording a film score to catering on a set can qualify for a credit, with no dollar amount limit, as long as a Georgia vendor is used. Yellow production signs started appearing all over the city, and beloved theater actors started appearing on the silver screen.\n\u201cMy OGs tell me stories of the days you had to drive two-plus hours for an audition every time, callbacks included,\u201d Ms. Deadwyler said. \u201cNow, I\u2019m able to take my son to school, go prep for my audition, do the audition and pick him up to be home to make dinner.\u201d\nAccording to the Georgia Department of Economic Development, the film and television industry made a $9.5 billion impact on the state in fiscal year 2017, making the state the top filming location in the world.\nSome 40 major movies and network television shows are now shooting in the state, and countless more independent projects. Among those recently filmed: \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d \u201cHidden Figures,\u201d \u201cThe Real Housewives of Atlanta,\u201d \u201cStranger Things,\u201d and, of course, the Emmy-winning FX comedy \u201cAtlanta.\u201d\nThe flood started with a trickle, thanks to movies like \u201cDrumline\u201d and \u201cATL,\u201d which showcased the city\u2019s cultural landscape. The emergence of Tyler Perry Studios in 2008 marked a colossal turning point. The original studio was located in southwest Atlanta; in 2016 Mr. Perry completed construction on a facility that sits on more than 300 acres of an old army base near the airport. Mr. Perry has three shows on the Oprah Winfrey Network right now; and in the past year, 33 different productions have filmed at the studios.\nAs opportunities expanded, actors in surrounding states took notice.\nBethany Anne Lind and her husband, who is also an actor, moved here from North Carolina in 2006, just before the industry boom. She got her first day player role on Lifetime\u2019s \u201cDrop Dead Diva\u201d; the director of her episodes found a spot for her in the cast of the ABC Family (now Freeform) network\u2019s \u201cMean Girls 2\u201d in 2011.\nLast year, she appeared on five episodes of \u201cOzark,\u201d the Netflix series with Jason Bateman and Laura Linney. She recently filmed \u201cLore\u201d for Amazon Prime, and this spring is working on two independent films.\nShe also found time to star as Viola (the Gwyneth Paltrow role) in Alliance Theater\u2019s stage version of \u201cShakespeare in Love.\u201d\n\u201cNo one can earn their living doing theater in Atlanta, because there\u2019s not enough work,\u201d Ms. Lind said bluntly. \u201cSo if you\u2019re going to make a living as an actor, you have to be on camera.\u201d\n\u201cI think I got here at just the right time,\u201d she added. \u201cThree or four years ago, all of the agencies in town were swamped and couldn\u2019t keep up, but they\u2019re figuring it out now.\u201d\nEnoch King, who has been acting in the Atlanta market for 20 years, filmed alongside Jason Ritter on ABC\u2019s \u201cKevin (Probably) Saves the World\u201d last October while he was onstage in Lucas Hnath\u2019s play \u201cThe Christians\u201d at Actor\u2019s Express theater.\nBy the time the episodes aired, he was in rehearsals for \u201cA Raisin in the Sun\u201d at American Stage in St. Petersburg, Fla.\n\u201cI thought that my talent only translated in Atlanta, but film and television has shown me that I can do this anywhere,\u201d said Mr. King. \u201cIt\u2019s really invigorating.\u201d\nActors\u2019 Equity recently released its first regional theater report, which compared the number of union members in a given market to the number of work weeks per year.\nAlthough there are two dozen professional theater companies in metropolitan Atlanta, the 520 union members in the Atlanta area average 5.6 weeks of stage work per year. That leaves a lot of room for work in non-Equity stage productions, as well as film, television, commercials and industrials.\nSome actors try to balance it all by negotiating a \u201chard out\u201d that allows them to be released from the set of a TV shoot at a certain time.\nBut that\u2019s a risk \u2014 one that Andrew Benator took while he was on set for a recurring role in Fox\u2019s \u201cThe Gifted,\u201d while in the Alliance\u2019s productions of \u201cCrossing Delancey\u201d and \u201cA Christmas Carol\u201d last fall. (He has also appeared in \u201cStranger Things,\u201d \u201cTyler Perry\u2019s House of Payne\u201d and \u201cBeing Mary Jane.\u201d)\n\u201cI was on set for 12 hours filming that day, left at 5:30 p.m., picked up some Chick-fil-A, cleared my head and did opening night of \u2018Crossing Delancey,\u2019\u201d he recalled.\nEven with the long hours, Mr. Benator, like most actors, enjoys the variety.\n\u201cIf I was doing a lot of TV, I\u2019d want to do a play and if I was doing a lot of theater, I\u2019d want to do film and TV,\u201d he said. \u201cI just like to do good writing.\u201d\nMs. Deadwyler is optimistic as well.\n\u201cI can do theater, film and TV in this city,\u201d she said. \u201cI can do indie, experimental and commercial film projects in this city. Atlanta has its limitations and challenges. However, with work and ingenuity, an artist can craft a creative life.\u201d", "date": "May 4, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/theater/atlanta-film-television-boom-theater-actors.html", "tags": "deadwyler actors maneuver room gives film theater work like boom television \u201d filming stage atlanta"}
