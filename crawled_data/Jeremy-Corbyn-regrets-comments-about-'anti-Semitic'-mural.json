{"title": "Jeremy Corbyn regrets comments about 'anti-Semitic' mural", "content": "Jeremy Corbyn has expressed \"sincere regret\" at failing to look more closely at an allegedly anti-Semitic mural in London before questioning its removal.\nThe Labour leader has been criticised for responding to a Facebook post by street artist, Mear One, in 2012, which asked why the image faced destruction.\nMr Corbyn had written: \"Why? You are in good company\" - but has now said the image was \"deeply disturbing\".\nThe mural, \"Freedom of Humanity\", was removed from East London in 2012.\n\"I wholeheartedly support its removal,\" Mr Corbyn said.\nLabour MP Luciana Berger - who highlighted the post on Twitter - called Mr Corbyn's response \"wholly inadequate\".\nShe said: \"It fails to understand on any level the hurt and anguish felt about anti-Semitism. I will be raising this further.\"\nIn the post from October 2012, the Labour leader appeared to oppose the mural's removal - by comparing it to Diego Rivera's \"Man at the Crossroads\", which the US Rockefeller family covered over because it featured a picture of Lenin. \nIn a statement, Mr Corbyn said he had intended to make a \"general comment\" about the removal of public art on the grounds of freedom of speech. \nHe added: \"I sincerely regret that I did not look more closely at the image I was commenting on, the contents of which are deeply disturbing and anti-Semitic.\n\"I am opposed to the production of anti-Semitic material of any kind, and the defence of free speech cannot be used as a justification for the promotion of anti-Semitism in any form.\"\nMear One - whose real name is Kalen Ockerman - has denied being anti-Semitic, saying the mural was about \"class and privilege\".", "date": "23 March 2018", "href": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43523445", "tags": "post anti-semitic labour image corbyn jeremy regret comments regrets mural removal said"}
