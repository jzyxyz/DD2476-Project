{"title": "5 in China Army Face U.S. Charges of Cyberattacks", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 In the Obama administration\u2019s most direct confrontation with China over its theft of corporate secrets, the Justice Department on Monday unsealed an indictment of five members of the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army and charged them with hacking into the networks of Westinghouse Electric, the United States Steel Corporation and other companies. \nThe indictment named members of Unit 61398, which was publicly identified last year as the Shanghai-based cyberunit of the People\u2019s Liberation Army, including its best-known hackers known online by the noms de guerre \u201cUglyGorilla\u201d and \u201cKandyGoo.\u201d \nThe F.B.I. and American intelligence agencies electronically tracked the activities of the hackers, one official said, and \u201cput them inside the Datong Road headquarters\u201d of the cyberunit, a heavily guarded 12-floor military tower near the Shanghai airport. \nThe move by the Justice Department was almost certainly symbolic since there is virtually no chance that the Chinese would turn over the five People\u2019s Liberation Army members named in the indictment. \nSince 2006, and as recently as last month, the indictment alleged, the hacking unit invaded the networks of American corporate targets, systematically copying their emails and, in some cases, infecting their computers with malware. \nThe indictment said that \u201cChinese firms hired the same P.L.A. unit\u201d to \u201cbuild a secret database to hold corporate intelligence.\u201d In one instance, the hackers broke into Westinghouse\u2019s network to learn the company\u2019s strategy for negotiating with one of China\u2019s state-owned enterprises. The hackers stole roughly 700,000 pages of emails, including some from its chief executive.\nAfter a year in which the dialogue between the two countries was derailed by Edward J. Snowden\u2019s disclosures about the United States\u2019 own spying efforts in China, the charges leveled by the Justice Department marked an effort by the Obama administration to return the debate over to grounds they think are more favorable to the United States: intellectual property theft.\nUntil now, President Obama and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel have tried relatively quiet diplomacy with the Chinese. They have attempted to engage the Chinese in a dialogue over norms for operating in cyberspace, a careful diplomatic dance that has gone on for several years. But Monday\u2019s action by the Justice Department marked an attempt to publicly shame the Liberation Army that included a \u201cmost wanted list\u201d of cyberattackers with photographs of several marked with the Dillinger-era label \u201cWanted by the F.B.I.\u201d \nBut it is a legal and diplomatic gamble whether this approach is more likely to halt attacks that a classified American report circulated last year said were directed at more than 3,000 American companies.\nAt the core of the indictment is the argument that while large countries routinely spy on each other for national security purposes, it is out of bounds to use state-run intelligence assets to seek commercial advantage. \u201cWhen a foreign nation uses military or intelligence resources and tools against an American executive or corporation to obtain trade secrets or sensitive business information for the benefit of its state-owned companies, we must say, \u2018Enough is enough,\u2019 \u201d said Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. \nBut the Chinese, with their vast state-owned enterprises, many run by the People\u2019s Liberation Army, have often argued that economic security and national security are one, and they have used Mr. Snowden\u2019s disclosures about the National Security Agency to make the case that the position of the United States is hypocritical because it also conducts attacks on Chinese firms. One such attack on the giant Chinese telecommunication firm Huawei was described in detail in the documents disclosed by Mr. Snowden, though it appeared aimed at penetrating Huawei\u2019s technology in order to monitor the networks of countries that buy the Chinese-made equipment.\nWithin hours of Mr. Holder\u2019s news conference in Washington, China denounced the indictment, saying it was based on \u201cfabricated facts\u201d and that it \u201cgrossly violates the basic norms governing international relations and jeopardizes China-U.S. cooperation.\u201d\nIn what the Chinese suggested would be only the first step in its response to the Obama administration\u2019s action, it cut off dealing with a joint United States-China working group on cyberattacks that the administration has until now said was evidence that the two countries were trying to resolve their differences.\nThe government\u2019s case focuses on industries, like steel and solar, where trade tensions have been mounting in recent years. Rising steel and solar exports from China have created friction with American companies and officials over worries that Beijing unfairly subsidizes its domestic players. The indictment also described how the Chinese unit broke into the systems of the United Steelworkers union, which has long pressed American officials to crack down on Chinese trade practices that it views as harming American workers. \nThe F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, said in an interview that federal authorities, who filed the 31-count indictment in Pittsburgh, had not brought the charges to generate publicity.\n\u201cIf we fabricated all this, then come over to Pittsburgh and embarrass us by forcing us to put up or shut up and we\u2019ll put up,\u201d Mr. Comey said, a reference to the fact that the targets named in the indictment were largely in Western Pennsylvania. \u201cI welcome them to come over and enjoy the remarkable protections of our criminal justice system where they will have lawyers, the charges will have to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt and they will have to be convicted by a 12-person jury.\u201d\nIn a separate case, prosecutors also announced the arrests of 90 people in connection with their use of software called Blackshades, which allows hackers to remotely control a computer. Mr. Comey said that the cases showed that the federal government would pursue cybercrimes, regardless of whether they were perpetrated by groups or nations.\nJames A. Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that \u201cChina will be tempted to retaliate\u201d for Monday\u2019s actions. He said that the Chinese could punish United States firms operating in China or seek countercharges against American officials based on the Snowden leaks, but it is unclear a broader trade war would benefit either nation.\nIt was significant that the indictment dealt almost exclusively with Unit 61398 \u2014 also known as Comment Crew \u2014 but did not detail the case against another roughly 20 Chinese hacking groups, some associated with the military, that the United States regularly tracks. That suggested that the Obama administration may be holding other cases in reserve as leverage in case the Chinese retaliate.\nThe indictment also did not touch on Chinese attacks aimed at the Defense Department or major defense contractors, perhaps because the administration did not want to invite Chinese revelations about American attacks on similar targets in Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong.\nSecurity officials say Monday\u2019s indictment has been in the works for two years. A major challenge, officials say, was convincing the targeted corporations to step forward. Many feared loss of revenues from their operations in China or retaliation by the Chinese state. \n\u201cThey had to gather really strong evidence that these companies had been hacked and then had to convince the companies to go public, despite fear of retaliation,\u201d Mr. Lewis said. The indictment, he said, is not about what the United States will do with these hackers, but what China will do with them. \u201cThe indictment is meant to send a clear public message to China that they need to take action,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need to get these P.L.A. entities under control.\u201d", "date": "May 19, 2014", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/20/us/us-to-charge-chinese-workers-with-cyberspying.html", "tags": "american face administration cyberattacks china u.s. indictment united army \u201d charges states chinese"}
