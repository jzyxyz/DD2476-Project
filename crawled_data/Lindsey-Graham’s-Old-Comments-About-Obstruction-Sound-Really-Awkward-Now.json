{"title": "Lindsey Graham\u2019s Old Comments About Obstruction Sound Really Awkward Now", "content": "Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has become a staunch defender of President Donald Trump\u00a0in recent years, but some of his old comments on the issue of obstruction sound a lot different than what he\u2019s saying today.\u00a0\nJust last month, Graham used one of Trump\u2019s favorite phrases.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cNo collusion and no obstruction,\u201d Graham said after Attorney General William Barr released his summary of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation.\u00a0\nBut in 1999, Graham maintained a much stricter standard while serving in the House as one of the\u00a0managers\u00a0in President Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment proceedings:\nMueller\u2019s redacted report spelled out 10 instances in which Trump may have attempted to obstruct justice. Yet Graham didn\u2019t seem inclined to revise his views based on those details.\nGraham, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, also said on Thursday that he has no plans to call on Mueller to testify about the investigation.\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s done his job,\u201d Graham said, per The Hill. \u201cI\u2019m not going to retry the case.\u201d", "date": "\n04/19/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/lindsey-graham-1999-obstruction_n_5cb964cee4b068d795cb11b2", "tags": "\u201c really sound awkward mueller investigation one lindsey comments old said obstruction graham"}
