{"title": "Foiled Paris attack 'was directed by IS'", "content": "Three women arrested over a foiled attack in Paris were directed by so-called Islamic State (IS) from Syria, a French prosecutor has said. \nThe group \"wanted to make the women into fighters\", Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said.\nThe suspects were held after police found a car filled with gas cylinders.\nOne of the women, identified as Sarah H, aged 23, had been engaged separately to two French jihadists, both now dead, who carried out attacks this year.\nA policeman was stabbed during an operation late on Thursday to arrest the women, after the discovery of the suspect car near Notre Dame cathedral in Paris on Sunday. \nPolice shot and wounded one of the women during the operation in Boussy-Saint-Antoine, south-east of the city.\nOne of those arrested, identified as Ines Madani, aged 19, reportedly declared her allegiance to IS in a letter. Mr Molins said she had tried several times to travel to Syria.\nThe third woman was identified as Amel S, 39. Her 15-year-old daughter, who had been radicalised, was also taken into custody, the prosecutor said.\nMr Molins said Sarah H had been engaged to Larossi Abballa, who killed two police officials in June before being shot dead himself, and subsequently to Adel Kermiche, who was shot dead by police in July after slitting the throat of an elderly priest in his church.\nHer current fiance was arrested on Thursday, Mr Molins said.\nThe women and their associates had already been under surveillance but the discovery of the gas-filled car near Notre Dame had pitted the security forces in \"a race against time\" to arrest them, French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said.\nThe three women were believed to be planning other imminent and violent attacks, he said.\nPresident Francois Hollande said: \"An attack was derailed... a group has been disbanded, but there are others and we must be able to act each time before it is too late and that's what we're doing.\"\nMr Molins said the latest plot provided more evidence that IS was ready to use women for attacks. \n\"If at first it seemed that women were confined to carrying out family and domestic tasks by the terrorist organisation, we are now forced to see that vision is largely outdated,\" he said.", "date": "9 September 2016", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-37318310", "tags": "arrested car foiled molins directed police prosecutor women attack french paris"}
