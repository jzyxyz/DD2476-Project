{"title": "Netanyahu Seeks to Name a Golan Heights Settlement for President Trump", "content": "JERUSALEM \u2014 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said on Tuesday that he would ask his government to approve naming a new Jewish settlement in the Golan Heights for President Trump, in appreciation of the American leader\u2019s proclamation recognizing Israel\u2019s authority over the long-disputed territory.\nMr. Netanyahu\u2019s announcement, made during a Passover tour of the Golan Heights with his family, came a month after Mr. Trump\u2019s proclamation, which delivered a valuable pre-election gift to Mr. Netanyahu even as it upended decades of American policy in the Middle East.\nDespite facing corruption charges, Mr. Netanyahu has since won a fourth consecutive term in office \u2014 a fifth over all \u2014 setting him on course to become Israel\u2019s longest-serving prime minister, surpassing the record of the founding premier, David Ben Gurion.\n\u201cAll Israelis were deeply moved when President Trump made his historic decision to recognize Israel\u2019s sovereignty over the Golan Heights,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said in a video on Tuesday, against the backdrop of the sunny, windswept strategic plateau that Israel captured from Syria during the Six-Day War of 1967.\n\u201cTherefore, after the Passover holiday,\u201d he said, \u201cI intend to bring to the government a resolution calling for a new community on the Golan Heights named after President Donald J. Trump.\u201d\nSituated above the Sea of Galilee, the Israeli-controlled portion of the Golan Heights covers less than 500 square miles, with commanding views over much of northern Israel and into Syria. Syrian forces tried to reclaim the territory in 1973 but were beaten back.\nThe armistice that ended the war left most of the Golan Heights in Israeli hands, and in 1981 Israel passed a law that effectively annexed it.\nAbout 50,000 people live in the area, with Israeli Jewish settlers making up nearly half. The rest are mostly Druze Arabs with Syrian roots. The area contains a handful of Druze villages and more than 30 Jewish settlements that have been built since 1967.\nSuccessive Israeli prime ministers \u2014 including Mr. Netanyahu in 2010 \u2014 have tried to negotiate a land-for-peace deal with Syria that would involve an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights.\nBut those efforts came to an end with the Arab Spring uprisings that spread to Syria after sweeping the Middle East in early 2011, the civil war that has raged in the country since then, and an Iranian military buildup there.\nInstead there has been talk of vastly increasing Jewish settlements in the Golan Heights.\nCongratulating Mr. Netanyahu on his initiative, the Israeli regional council in the Golan said the decision to dedicate a community to Mr. Trump \u201ccomplements the aspiration and the goal we have set to double the number of residents of the Golan within a decade.\u201d\nAl-Marsad, an advocacy group that campaigns against Israel\u2019s occupation of the area, has expressed deep concern over reported government plans to increase the population of the area to 250,000 people by 2048.\nAlthough Mr. Trump\u2019s recognition remains at odds with United Nations resolutions rejecting the seizure of land by force, Mr. Netanyahu has hailed it as a diplomatic victory.\nSome Israeli experts welcomed the recognition as a friendly gesture, though one that has limited value.\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to have, but how significant it is could be argued,\u201d Sallai Meridor, who served as Israel\u2019s ambassador to the United States from 2005 to 2009, said in a recent interview.\nCalling Mr. Trump\u2019s Golan recognition \u201conly a declaration,\u201d Mr. Meridor noted that the presidential proclamation was done without bipartisan support or international backing, and is not binding on future administrations.\nCritics described Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s intention to name a new Golan community for Mr. Trump as sycophantic. On Twitter, commentators responded with sarcastic suggestions like calling the territory \u201cGolden Heights\u201d or \u201cGolfing Heights.\u201d\nIn late 2017, after Mr. Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, an Israeli minister proposed to express his gratitude by putting Mr. Trump\u2019s name on a new train station that would bring thousands of tourists directly to the Jewish Quarter of the disputed Old City.\nThe minister, Yisrael Katz, was in charge of transportation and intelligence affairs at the time. He is now also Israel\u2019s minister of foreign affairs.\nIt is unclear whether the new train station will ultimately be built.", "date": "April 23, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/23/world/middleeast/netanyahu-golan-heights-trump.html", "tags": "heights name \u201c seeks president israel trump netanyahu israeli golan settlement \u2014"}
