{"title": "Violence Erupts In Portland Amid Alt-Right, Anti-Fascist Rallies", "content": "PORTLAND, Ore. \u2015\u00a0For days, Portland has served as ground zero for American hate, heroism and healing. Today, it served as America\u2019s battleground.\nWhat started Sunday as two counterdemonstrations outside City Hall between anti-fascist protesters and members of the alt-right during a \u201cTrump Free Speech Rally\u201d evolved into an impromptu march and standoff with police.\u00a0\nAs police began closing off Chapman Square, where the anti-fascists had staged their protest, at around 3:45 p.m., officers lobbed loud explosives in the protesters\u2019 direction. It\u2019s unclear whether they were concussion or tear gas grenades, but there was a yellow smoke emanating from some of them. At least five explosions were heard as police pushed people back from that square.\nPortland police said the explosives were in response to projectiles thrown at its officers.\u00a0\nFollowing the release of the explosives, hundreds of the anti-fascist protesters and others started an impromptu march, heading northbound from City Hall and pouring into major roadways open to traffic.\u00a0\nThe protesters were held up by police at Fourth Ave. and Morrison Street in Downtown Portland, where officers arrested some and pushed others with batons. \u00a0\nPolice fired non-lethal rounds at protesters hiding in a parking garage near the intersection. Shortly after, a chemical substance was released from the spot police fired, burning and stinging marchers\u2019\u00a0lungs and noses. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear whether police fired chemical rounds, but the department tweeted that coughing in the crowd was caused by an unknown substance,\u00a0\u201cpossibly from parking garage,\u201d and not released by police.\u00a0\nPolice released a photo on their Twitter account. The police say they seized knives, construction tools and bits of bricks from protesters.\u00a0\nThe day\u2019s crowds thinned and moved away from the park by 5:30 p.m., though pockets of protesters stopped on side streets to argue. Gibson was seen leaving with a few others, followed closely by about two dozen protesters chanting \u201cget out\u201d and waving goodbye.\nOverall, it appeared that the war Portland was gearing up for wasn\u2019t going to happen. Police successfully dispersed many of the crowds and kept them under control, and both sides seemed content to stay relatively peaceful.\nBut as early as 10:30 a.m. Sunday, it didn\u2019t feel that way. The self-proclaimed anti-fascist and alt-right groups had occupied the parks surrounding City Hall, shoving each other and screaming until police showed up. Local and state officers, riot police and the Department of Homeland Security held the line, leaving each side to hurl insults at one another across the street for most of the day.\nHuffPost reporters witnessed several scattered arrests made for disorderly conduct.\nA third crowd \u2015 the largest \u2015 of local liberals protesting the Trump supporters sat outside City Hall.\u00a0\nIt was a battle they\u2019d been preparing for all week; longstanding tensions between anti-fascists and the alt-right were compounded by the hate-fueled slashing on May 26 that left two dead and a nation in uproar.\nIn the Trump camp, which had planned its rally days before the recent attack, alt-righters including Washington stood among people with Nazi symbolism tattooed on their arms and civilian \u201cpeacekeepers\u201d in military gear.\nThe loudest demonstrators on each side were often the last to identify themselves.\n\u201cWe\u2019re surrounded,\u201d one woman in a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat said. \u201cThat\u2019s Portland for ya.\u201d\nThe Trump rally was already expected to attract alt-right figures from out of state \u2015 some of whom are straight up neo-Nazis \u2015 but rumors that that demonstrators would be\u00a0exercising their right to carry guns\u00a0prompted local activists to reconsider and had all sides preparing for war. Mayor Ted Wheeler\u2019s attempt to revoke a permit for the rally was declined by the federal government.\nJoey Gibson, who organized today\u2019s Trump rally as well as the one on April 29 at which last week\u2019s stabbing suspect Jeremy Joseph Christian was seen throwing up Nazi salutes, spoke after 2 p.m. to hundreds.\n\u201cPortland I mean no disrespect, but you have gotten crazy out here,\u201d he screamed into a mic. \u201cYou\u2019re sitting here in a bubble and we\u2019ve been on the outside looking in, but no more.\u201d\nHe said he wanted to \u201cstop focusing on racism\u201d as anti-fascists audibly condemned him from across the street.\nAnti-fascists in Portland had planned to hold a self-defense and group tactics seminar Saturday, but organizers told HuffPost that it was canceled after white nationalists and neo-Nazis mobilized against them.\nThe Trump rally\u2019s co-organizer, Kyle \u201cBased Stickman\u201d Chapman, has engaged anti-fascist protesters in battle before. His group of mostly white men called the Fraternal Order of Alt-Knights was labeled a \u201cfight club\u201d by The New York Times and issued a call to arms to his followers for Sunday.\nFights in Portland, just a week after known white supremacist Joseph Christian allegedly slashed two men to death\u00a0while screaming anti-Islamic hate at two teenaged women on a train, feel surprising and excessive to outsiders. But locals saw this coming a mile away \u2015 this is a city with a white terror crisis\u00a0and a storied history of racist confrontation. Sunday was a flashpoint in a decades-old fight.", "date": "\n06/04/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/violence-erupts-in-portland-as-alt-right-anti-fascists-square-off_n_5932c1ebe4b075bff0f3dc8c", "tags": "portland alt-right city rallies protesters erupts \u201d \u2015 anti-fascist rally two violence police amid"}
