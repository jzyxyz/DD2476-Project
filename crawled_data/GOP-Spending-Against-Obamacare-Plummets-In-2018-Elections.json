{"title": "GOP Spending Against Obamacare Plummets In 2018 Elections", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2015 Since the Affordable Care Act\u2019s passage in 2010, repealing Obamacare has been the driving issue for the Republican Party. \nGOP lawmakers voted to defund, change or repeal parts of the law at least 67 times while President Barack Obama was in office, and they promised voters that if they won control of the White House, they\u2019d make the dream of full repeal come true.\nRepublicans received their chance in the 2016 elections, which handed the party control of both chambers of Congress and the White House. But they failed to get the job done last year as voters realized what they\u2019d be losing and public opinion swung in favor of the law. The GOP has shown no signs of trying to take up repeal again this year.\nNow, Republicans are giving up on Obamacare repeal as a campaign issue as well. Anti-Obamacare ad spending in the 2018 election cycle has plummeted compared to the same period in the previous three cycles, according to data compiled by Kantar Media/CMAG for HuffPost.\u00a0\n\u201cThe reality of the situation is that Republicans really don\u2019t have much to say about health care at this point,\u201d said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster who is president of Hart Research. \n\u201cWhat are they going to say on it?\u201d admitted a Republican strategist who requested anonymity to speak openly and who previously worked at the National Republican Congressional Committee. \u201cWe\u2019ll repeal Obamacare? I mean, what are they going to say that\u2019s believable?\u201d\nDemocratic spending on health care ads is slightly up from where it was in the past three election cycles during the same period. And Democratic strategists and candidates say that for them, health care will be front and center. \n\u201cWe see health care as the defining issue of the 2018 midterms,\u201d said David Bergstein, spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. \u201cThe Republican health care agenda is incredibly toxic with voters of every political persuasion.\u201d \nFor the first time in an election cycle since Obamacare\u2019s passage, a majority of the public now approves of the health care law. Democrats now have a sizable advantage over the GOP on the issue, too. And in a recent HuffPost/YouGov poll, voters chose health care as one of their top issues. \nEven a poll commissioned by America First Policies, a pro-Trump group, found that lowering the cost of health care is the top issue for many voters. Of the respondents who said health care is a top concern, only 34 percent said they want Obamacare repealed and replaced. Forty-seven percent wanted problems with the law to be fixed, while 15 percent said they want it to stay exactly as it is. \n\u201cOne of the ironies of the Republican attack on the Affordable Care Act is it\u2019s made it more popular in voters\u2019 eyes, especially as voters have a chance to compare the Affordable Care Act to the Republican alternatives,\u201d Garin said. \nRepublican attempts to repeal Obamacare met a wall of opposition last year as the details of GOP alternatives became clear and Americans realized what it would mean for people who now benefit from the law\u2019s protections and financial assistance. As part of a broader mobilization against the Trump administration and its policies, Obamacare supporters showed up at town halls and protests around the country, leading to high-profile confrontations and pleas to keep the health care law in place. \nHealth care is one of the most personal of issues \u2015 far more so than tax cuts, which is what Republicans apparently want to run on this cycle \u2015 and Democrats are using it in powerful campaign ads. Health care costs are still a significant concern for people, and the GOP has largely dropped any efforts to make health care more affordable. \nAnna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster at Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research, cautioned that while there\u2019s no doubt that people are concerned about health care costs, she\u2019s not sure if that issue \u2015 or any other particular issue \u2015 will be what drives people to the polls in November. In political discussions, people talk more about how much they hate the divisiveness in the country, she said.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be interesting to see how Democrats can bring the health care issue in as an indictment of Republicans and their values, but also as an economic conversation at a time when a lot of this is being driven by this kind of larger mood in the country,\u201d she said. \nRepublicans sense that health care is no longer an issue they own. Rep. Mike Bishop (R-Mich.) is in what should be a reliably Republican district, but in an election year that\u2019s already bringing unexpected wins to Democrats, Bishop\u2019s seat is considered a bellwether that could be up for grabs. Last year, his campaign site had a section about repealing Obamacare.\u00a0\nThis year, Bishop\u2019s \u201cissues\u201d page has no mention of health care. Stu Sandler, a campaign consultant for Bishop, told The Washington Post that the new site reflects the congressman\u2019s accomplishments and that he hasn\u2019t changed his position on Obamacare. \n\u201cI\u2019m sure Republicans want to change the topic,\u201d said Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic consultant who works with groups on the health care issue. \u201cIf you asked the captain of the Titanic, he\u2019d want to change directions too. But after you\u2019ve already hit the iceberg, it\u2019s too late.\u201d \nTax cuts seem to be where Republicans are focusing their energy and pinning their 2018 hopes. \n\u201cI think running for the benefits of tax reform is where I\u2019m going to focus my attention on speaking about why ... we should be the party in power and in control, and what that means for the American people,\u201d\u00a0Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) said Tuesday when asked about health care in the midterms.\nBut so far, that measure \u2015 which was supposed to be the highlight of the GOP legislative agenda \u2015 isn\u2019t resonating as much as the party would have liked. Toward the end of the heated special election in Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th Congressional District last month, Republicans largely abandoned ads touting their signature piece of legislation.\nOn Tuesday, House GOP leadership told its members that they needed to get out there and start talking more about the tax cut law,\u00a0because right now, it\u2019s not at the top of the public\u2019s minds. \nRepublicans did run ads on Obamacare in the Pennsylvania special election, going after Democrat Conor Lamb for supporting the health care law. And Republican Rick Saccone supported repeal. But ultimately, it didn\u2019t work. Lamb won in a district where the Republican incumbent (who resigned over a sexual misconduct scandal) had run unopposed in the previous two cycles. Trump won there by 20 percentage points as well.\u00a0\nA Democratic poll found that the health care message was a winning issue in the race, with a majority of voters opposed to what the Republicans wanted to do to the Affordable Care Act.\nOn the anti-Obamacare side, the American Action Network is running the greatest number of ads \u2015 and spending the most money ($1,253,700) \u2015 this cycle, according to the data compiled by Kantar Media/CMAG for HuffPost.\u00a0On the pro-Obamacare side, the group Save My Care has the highest number of spots, while J.B. Pritzker, who just won Illinois\u2019 Democratic gubernatorial primary, has spent the most money ($2,173,010).\u00a0\nYet the ongoing efforts to undermine the law \u2015 and how that affects voter sentiments \u2015 are an X-factor in all of this. Last year\u2019s GOP tax bill eliminated the financial penalty for people who don\u2019t get insurance. Without that penalty in place, healthy people are less likely to buy insurance, causing premiums for those who keep insurance to rise. \u00a0\nAt the same time, Republicans at both the state and federal levels are doing what they can to change the rules on the kinds of insurance available. This is expected to result in cheap but less generous plans for people in good health \u2015 and more expensive premiums for people who want or need more comprehensive coverage, including those with pre-existing conditions. \u00a0\nThe effects of some of these changes will become apparent this fall, right before Election Day, as consumers begin to learn what coverage for next year will cost.\nRepublicans will likely respond as they always have, making the argument Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.) did in a closed-door event this month. The problem, they\u2019ll say, is still with the law itself. Give Republicans more seats in Congress, and this time, they\u2019ll actually repeal it.\nIgor Bobic contributed reporting.
