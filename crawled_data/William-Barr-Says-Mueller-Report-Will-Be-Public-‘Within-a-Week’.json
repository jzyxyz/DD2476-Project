Barr said he will deliver the Mueller report to Congress and the public within a week, reiterating his earlier promise to release it by mid-April.\n\u2022 Testifying before the House Appropriations Committee on Tuesday, Mr. Barr said he would be transparent about redactions in the report. But he demurred when asked whether he has briefed the White House on it.\n\u2022 The Justice Department inspector general expects to finish an examination of aspects of the Russia investigation by May or June, Mr. Barr revealed.\n\u2022 Mr. Barr has tried to keep the appropriations hearing focused on the department\u2019s proposed $29.2 billion budget, which includes money for 100 new immigration judges as President Trump hardens his stance on immigration along the southwestern border.\nMr. Barr, hit immediately with questions about his handling of the Mueller report by Democrats, reiterated his vow to be as transparent as possible and said that he will turn over a redacted version of the report to Congress and the public within a week.\nMr. Barr went over the categories of information he says he must black out \u2014 like information that is subject to grand-jury secrecy rules \u2014 and said that whatever he censors in the report, he will identify the reason.\n\u201cThis process is going along very well and my original timetable of being able to release this by mid-April stands,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so I think that from my standpoint, within a week I will be in a position to release the report to the public.\u201d\nRepresentative Jos\u00e9 E. Serrano, Democrat of New York and the head of the appropriations subcommittee that covers the Justice Department, pressed Mr. Barr to say whether the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, or his staff had played any role in drafting or reviewing two letters that Mr. Barr sent to Congress late last month about the report. Mr. Barr said that the special counsel had not participated in writing those letters, nor seen them in advance, though he gave Mr. Mueller the chance to see his letter summarizing the investigation\u2019s main findings.\n\u201cThe letter of the 24th, Mr. Mueller\u2019s team did not play a role in drafting that document, although we offered him the opportunity to review it before we sent it out and he declined that,\u201d Mr. Barr said. \u201cThe letter on the 29th, I don\u2019t believe that that was reviewed by Mr. Mueller or that they participated in drafting that letter.\u201d\nRepresentative Nita M. Lowey, Democrat of New York and chairwoman of the full Appropriations Committee, pressed Mr. Barr to say whether the White House has seen or been briefed on the contents of the Mueller report beyond what was in his letters about it to Congress. But Mr. Barr refused to answer.\n\u201cI\u2019ve said what I\u2019m going to say about the report today,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve issued three letters about it. I was willing to discuss the historic information of how the report came to me and my decision on Sunday,\u201d March 24, when he wrote a four-page letter to Congress laying out the special counsel\u2019s top-line findings.\n\u201cBut I\u2019ve already laid out the process that is going forward to release these reports hopefully within a week,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say anything more about it until the report is out and everyone has a chance to look at it.\u201d\nIn the past, Justice Department officials have said that Mr. Barr had not shown the White House any part of the Mueller report or briefed Mr. Trump\u2019s team about its contents. His demurral on Tuesday raised the possibility that the situation has shifted and the White House knows more than the public or Congress about what Mr. Mueller said.\nDemocrats who lead the House Appropriations Committee were eager to press Mr. Barr on what one called \u201cthe elephant in the room\u201d: his handling of the highly anticipated special counsel\u2019s report.\n\u201cThe American people have been left with many unanswered questions; serious concerns about the process by which you formulated your letter; and uncertainty about when we can expect to see the full report,\u201d Mr. Serrano said in his opening remarks.\n\u201cI think it would strike a serious blow to our system and yes to our democracy if that report is not fully seen,\u201d he added.\nDemocrats have criticized Mr. Barr\u2019s decision to share Mr. Mueller\u2019s top-line findings in a four-page letter that quoted sparingly from the report itself and his declaration that Mr. Trump had not committed an obstruction-of-justice offense after Mr. Mueller declined to make a prosecutorial judgment. They renewed their complaints after The New York Times revealed last week that some of Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigators have complained that Mr. Barr failed to fully represent their findings and that they were more damaging for the president than the attorney general indicated.\nOn Tuesday, they had their first chance to level criticism in person. Ms. Lowey called Mr. Barr\u2019s handling of the Mueller report \u201cunacceptable\u201d and questioned how quickly he summarized the findings in his March 24 letter.\n\u201cEven for someone who has done this job before,\u201d she said, referring to Mr. Barr\u2019s first stint as attorney general in the 1990s, \u201cI would argue it is more suspicious than impressive.\u201d\nBatting back Democrats\u2019 criticism, Mr. Barr insisted that he had accurately delivered the \u201cbottom-line\u201d conclusions of the special counsel\u2019s investigation in his letter to Congress and warned that attempting to quickly summarize the report more fully would have exposed him to a minefield of potential criticism.\nAsked about The Times\u2019s reporting on frustrations among some of Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigators about the narrow scope of his letter laying out their findings, Mr. Barr appeared unswayed.\n\u201cI was not interested in putting out summaries or trying to summarize,\u201d Mr. Barr said, \u201cbecause I think any summary, regardless of who prepares it, not only runs the risk of being under-inclusive or over-inclusive, but also would trigger a lot of discussion and analysis that really should await everything coming out at once.\u201d\nEach page of the report was marked that it might contain secret grand jury material and could not be readily released anyway, he said. He also said he had asked the intelligence community to review the report for any information that might compromise their sources and methods of intelligence-gathering and would thus need to be redacted.\nBut he did not address his decision to step in and make a judgment on whether Mr. Trump illegally obstructed justice after Mr. Mueller\u2019s team conspicuously did not.\nRepublicans tried to help Mr. Barr hammer home the report\u2019s top-line findings.\n\u201cThe conclusions were simple: no collusion, no obstruction,\u201d said Representative Tom Graves, Republican of Georgia, ignoring Mr. Mueller\u2019s statement that the investigation did not \u201cexonerate\u201d Mr. Trump of obstruction and that it found no criminal conspiracy between any Trump associates and Russia\u2019s election interference.\nMr. Graves added, \u201cIs there anything new you have seen that would change your conclusions?\u201d\nMr. Barr responded, \u201cThere is nothing to suggest to me\u201d that the conclusions have changed. \u201cThe letter speaks for itself.\u201d\n[Congress waits as Barr blacks out parts of the Mueller report.]\nOne of the key reasons Mr. Barr has said he must black out portions of the Mueller report before showing it to Congress is a federal rule of criminal procedure that forbids Justice Department officials from disclosing grand-jury information to outsiders.\nOn its face, that rule \u2014 known as 6(e) \u2014 makes no exception for Congress. There are exceptions to the rule, however, particularly if a judge issues an order permitting the material to be disclosed. That happened in 1974, when a judge overseeing the Watergate grand jury permitted the evidence it gathered to be sent to the House Judiciary Committee, which had opened an impeachment inquiry into President Nixon.\nBut the executive branch in 1974 supported sending the evidence to Congress. Mr. Barr was asked whether his Justice Department would be willing to join a similar motion to allow Congress to see the grand-jury material that Mr. Mueller gathered.\nBut Mr. Barr said he has no such intention. He said if House Judiciary Committee members want to see that material, they can ask the judge.\n\u201cThe chairman of the Judiciary Committee is free to go to court if he feels one of those exceptions is applicable,\u201d Mr. Barr said, adding: \u201cMy intention is not to ask for it at this stage. I mean, if the chairman has a good explanation of why 6(e) does not apply and his need for the information, I\u2019m willing to listen.\u201d\nUnder pressure to give Congress the entire text of the Mueller report, Mr. Barr repeatedly reminded his critics that he is operating under rules written by Clinton administration officials to prevent a repetition of the Whitewater-Monica Lewinsky scandal, where Ken Starr gave lawmakers a long report that contained detailed narrative description of the evidence, including lurid sexual details and extensive legal analysis of potential crimes by the president.\nMr. Barr\u2019s point seemed to be: If you have a problem with this process, blame the Clinton Democrats.\n\u201cThis whole mechanism for the special counsel, as I said, was established during the Clinton administration in the wake of Ken Starr\u2019s report,\u201d Mr. Barr said. \u201cThat\u2019s why the current rule says the report should be kept confidential, because there was a lot of reaction against the publication of Ken Starr\u2019s report and many of the people who are right now calling for release of this report were basically castigating Ken Starr and others for releasing the Starr report.\u201d\nMr. Starr, the independent counsel leading the Clinton investigation, was operating under a now-defunct law that gave him the authority to send a report directly to Congress. The Republican-controlled Congress promptly made the whole thing public.\nThat experience helped persuade members of Congress of both parties that the independent counsel law should be permitted to lapse in 1999. But there was still a need for some kind of mechanism for prosecutors with a degree of independence to investigate potential high-level executive-branch wrongdoing.\nUnder then-Attorney General Janet Reno, the Clinton administration issued the special counsel regulation that governed Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation. Among other things, it called for the special counsel to write a \u201cconfidential\u201d report for the attorney general, who would then relay his own report to Congress saying the investigation was over. In short, those rules did not envision a lengthy report from Mr. Mueller going to Congress and being published for the public to read \u2014 in any form.\n\u201cYou will recognize that I\u2019m operating under a regulation that was put together during the Clinton administration and does not provide for the publication of the report,\u201d Mr. Barr said. \u201cBut I am relying on my own discretion to make as much public as I can.\u201d\nRepresentative Matt Cartwright, Democrat of Pennsylvania, assailed Mr. Barr and the Justice Department for declining to defend the Affordable Care Act in federal court in Texas, where a judge recently struck down the sweeping health care law as unconstitutional.\nMr. Cartwright accused Mr. Barr of putting the weight of the Justice Department behind a political effort to invalidate the law and warned that it could result in millions of people losing their health care coverage.\nMr. Barr did not dispute that he had decided to no longer defend the law but told Mr. Cartwright that he had \u201cnothing to worry about\u201d if he thought that the department had taken \u201csuch an outrageous position\u201d because the government was likely to lose the case in question. \u201cLet the courts do their job,\u201d Mr. Barr said.\nRepublicans have challenged the law in various court cases since it was passed nine years ago. Late last year, a federal judge in Texas struck down the law on the grounds that its requirement that Americans buy health insurance was unconstitutional. The Justice Department had said last summer that it would no longer defend that mandate, and broadened its attack on the law last month, telling a federal appeals court that it believed the entire law should be invalidated.\nIf the court accepts that argument, millions of people could lose health insurance. Mr. Barr declined to speculate about the impact of the Justice Department\u2019s decision not to defend the law, though he acknowledged that it could end with no plan in place for those who depend on the law to maintain coverage.\nThe exchange underscored Mr. Barr\u2019s sweeping view of executive power and that the attorney general ultimately answers to the president. Though the Justice Department generally defends the law in any challenges to it, Mr. Barr indicated he was willing to make an exception in a case where the president asked for something different so long as it was legally defensible.\nMr. Barr is requesting an additional $72.1 million for immigration enforcement \u2014 an amount that would fund 100 new immigration judges \u2014 at a time when Mr. Trump has hardened his stance against illegal immigration and asylum seekers. Over the past two days, he has purged top immigration and security leaders to accelerate that goal.\nWhile the additional judges will \u201cprovide some relief from a critical backlog in the immigration courts,\u201d Mr. Barr said, he also said that an influx of cases \u201cconstrains our ability to manage the backlog of cases, and other reforms are necessary.\u201d\nThe Justice Department oversees the nation\u2019s immigration judges, who are separate from the judicial branch.\nMr. Barr also said that \u201cattacking those transnational criminal organizations is a high priority\u201d for the department and noted that the Justice Department is asking for more than $140 million in budget increases at the F.B.I., the Drug Enforcement Administration and elsewhere to address drug crimes.\nThe Justice Department inspector general intends to complete by May or June his investigation into aspects of the Russia inquiry, including whether law enforcement officials abused their surveillance powers to spy on a Trump campaign aide, Mr. Barr said.\nThe inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, has been examining how the F.B.I. and Justice Department obtained a secret warrant in October 2016 to wiretap Carter Page, a former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser. Republicans have accused law enforcement officials of improperly obtaining the warrant because they relied in part on Democratic-funded opposition research compiled by Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence officer who was also an F.B.I. informant, in seeking permission from the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to surveil Mr. Page.\nAs part of his investigation, Mr. Horowitz is also scrutinizing the F.B.I.\u2019s relationship with Mr. Steele.\nMr. Barr also said he was studying the F.B.I.\u2019s decision to begin investigating ties between Russia and Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign during the 2016 election, Mr. Barr said. He said he was trying to get his \u201carms around all the aspects of the counterintelligence investigation.\u201d", "date": "April 9, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/09/us/politics/william-barr-testimony.html", "tags": "public \u2018 report within week department \u201d justice says barr congress william mueller"}
