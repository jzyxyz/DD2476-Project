{"title": "Ilhan Omar Talks Of 'Sisterhood' With Female Democrats In Congress", "content": "In an interview with director Ava DuVernay, Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) talked about how she and other congresswomen \u2015 especially the group of barrier-breaking, progressive freshmen\ufeff \u2015 support each other in their work in Washington, D.C. \n\u201cThere are lots of text threads. There is a lot of hugging and high-fiving,\u201d Omar said in the conversation published Wednesday in Interview magazine. \n\u201cWe are also developing a sisterhood with many of the members who are our seniors here.\u201d \nOmar name-dropped some of the other freshman Democrats who made history alongside her in the November elections: Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) was one of the nation\u2019s first Muslim congresswomen (along with Omar); Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) was the youngest woman elected to the body; and Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) was her state\u2019s first black congresswoman. \nOmar spoke to DuVernay \u2015 a trailblazer in her own industry \u2015 about the pressures of being the \u201cfirst.\u201d \n\u201cYou get to feel like you\u2019re drowning in it, because you don\u2019t want to mess this first thing up for everyone you want to hold the door open for,\u201d Omar said. \u201cIt has a negative weight.\u201d\nWhile the 116th Congress sworn in earlier this year was the nation\u2019s most diverse ever, the legislative body is still overwhelmingly white and male. In this environment, the new crop of \u201cvery untraditional members,\u201d as Omar put it, find their own ways to support each other. \n\u201cThere is this tradition here of men going to have their cocktail hours to drink their scotch and do their plotting,\u201d Omar said, adding that she and other women representatives look out for each other\u2019s \u201cwell-being.\u201d \u201cWe understand that we don\u2019t have a lot of time to sit around.\u201d \n\u201cWe\u2019re creating good trouble, and we\u2019re going to need one another,\u201d she added, echoing the words of civil rights icon and fellow Rep. John Lewis, who often urges young people to make \u201cgood trouble, necessary trouble\u201d in the fight for justice.\u00a0\nOmar and Ocasio-Cortez met during their campaigns as one might expect in 2018: through Twitter DM. \n\u201cMy daughter and husband mentioned this young woman who was running and challenging an incumbent, so I followed her on Twitter. Then she followed me back,\u201d she recounted. \u201cI inboxed her and I was like, \u2018You\u2019ve got this.\u2019\u201d\nSince they\u2019ve started their work in Congress earlier this year, both have been under intense scrutiny by the media and other politicians. Ocasio-Cortez faces near constant coverage, much of it negative and often outright sexist, by right-leaning news pundits. \nAnd Omar faced significant controversy around her comments questioning the U.S. relationship with Israel, which some painted as anti-Semitic. \nAsked how they\u2019ve been managing, Omar credited how she and other young Democratic freshmen are of a generation familiar with values borne of activism and \u201cmovement building.\u201d \n\u201cWe understand what self-care looks like. We understand what being in solidarity looks like. We understand what Shine Theory really looks like,\u201d she said, using a term coined by feminist podcasters Ann Friedman and Aminatou Sow to describe women supporting other women. \n\u201cSo we uplift one another,\u201d Omar added. \u201cWe understand that my sadness is the sadness of my sisters here in Congress. And their success is my success. We\u2019re not fighting for the limelight ... What we\u2019re fighting for is for our people.\u201d ", "date": "\n04/04/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ilhan-omar-interview-sisters-congress_n_5ca65c30e4b0409b0ec5be81", "tags": "female understand first democrats omar \u201d one \u2015 ocasio-cortez ilhan like congress talks"}
