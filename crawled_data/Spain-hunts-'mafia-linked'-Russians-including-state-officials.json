His wife Diana Gindin is on the list too.\nSome of the 12 were also named in an indictment issued by Spanish prosecutors last year, which listed 27 Russian suspects. \nPetrov was among 20 people arrested as part of a major investigation known as Operation Troika.\nSpanish prosecutors say Petrov's group had contacts with some senior government officials, including former defence minister Anatoly Serdyukov and former prime minister Viktor Zubkov. \nFormer Russian intelligence agent Alexander Litvinenko, murdered in London with radioactive polonium-210 in 2006, had been helping Spanish officials to investigate Russian organised crime. His activities in Spain emerged in the official British inquiry into his death.", "date": "3 May 2016", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-36194899", "tags": "russians officials russian judge petrov accused issued former including spanish state top hunts spain"}
