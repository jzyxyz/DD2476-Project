{"title": "'Game Of Thrones' Actor Says Cut Scene Would've Explained Confusing Finale Moment", "content": "Warning! Spoilers below for \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d Season 7! \n\u201cHow do you answer these charges ... Lord Baelish?\u201d\nWhen Sansa (Sophie Turner)\u00a0uttered those words in the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d Season 7 finale, we all pretty much went, \u201cWhoa.\u00a0What?\u201d\nIncluding Littlefinger (Aidan Gillen) ...\nArya (Maisie Williams) then answered Littlefinger\u2019s confusion with a wry, \u201cMy sister asked you a question.\u201d\nAgain, we were all like, \u201cWhaaaaat??\u201d\nDespite Littlefinger\u2019s attempts to tear the sisters apart, it appeared that at some point the Stark kids got together off screen and, with the help of Bran\u2019s (Isaac Hempstead Wright) limitless knowledge, planned Petyr Baelish\u2019s demise.\u00a0\nBut how? And when?\nWas the season-long tension between Sansa and Arya just a show for setting up Littlefinger? Were they conspiring the whole time?\nIt turns out there is a reason the moment the Stark kids came together felt sudden \u2015 because it was.\nIsaac Hempstead Wright told HuffPost that a deleted finale scene would\u2019ve explained things a little better.\n\u201cFunny enough, we did actually shoot a scene that didn\u2019t make it into that episode where Sansa knocks on Bran\u2019s door, and I don\u2019t know whether they actually want to change the story, but as I understand it, Sansa came to Bran and goes, \u2018Can you just look some of this up before I kill my sister?\u2019 That kind of sentiment. Sansa just checking that fact,\u201d said the actor.\nSo apparently, Sansa\u2019s scene with Littlefinger where she questions whether Arya was going to kill her was legit. She was actually worried, but then decided to check with Bran before doing something she might regret.\n\u201cI think it suddenly occurred to her that she\u2019s got the best fact-checker in the universe, someone who\u2019s gonna look up the entire history of time,\u201d Hempstead Wright continued. \u201cSo she stops by Bran\u2019s office and goes, \u2018Look, bro, can you just check up on what this crazy guy is actually about,\u2019 and Bran goes, \u2019Yeah, no worries. I got you,\u2019 and they all come together, and the three of them just fuck him up.\u201d\nThe Three-Eyed Raven continued dropping knowledge on us about what to expect in Season 8, and he even had a Bran-tastic reaction to one of HuffPost\u2019s original theories.\u00a0\nSo what\u2019s the deal with Bran holding back so much information?\nIt\u2019s less of Bran just holding back this information because right now Bran doesn\u2019t actually have the entire history of the world in his head. It\u2019s like he\u2019s got Kindle libraries of all the history of the universe, but he just hasn\u2019t read every volume yet. The old Three-Eyed Raven sat and actually went through every single page and read every single word, so he has known by heart everything that happens. Bran still has to look stuff up in a massive encyclopedia, so it\u2019s not that he doesn\u2019t know. It\u2019s like if people guide him in the right direction he can tell you anything. In his own time, he\u2019s working through everything that\u2019s happened. He needs like Samwell Tarly saying, \u201cCan you see this?\u201d Bran goes, \u201cOh, shit. Yeah, that actually did happen.\u201d [He needs] Sansa to say, \u201cWhat happened with Littlefinger?\u201d Boom.\nNow that Sam is there, people are saying Bran\u2019s like Google search.\nExactly!\u00a0And that\u2019s great because Bran doesn\u2019t necessarily have quite the initiative now to be able to formulate complex plans about, \u201cOh what do we need to know about this?\u201d It\u2019s just kind of like a slightly glazed-over super computer saying, \u201cOh, this happen. This happened. This happened. Oh, that\u2019s important. This happened. This happened. This happened.\u201d When Sam goes, \u201cOoh! Ooh! Tell me about this!\u201d Oh, here we go \u2026 Branipedia ... WikiBran.\nBran can be kind of emotionless, so how do you expect he\u2019s going to deliver the news to Jon and Dany?\nI\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll be Samwell Tarly that breaks that news. It\u2019d be a bit of an underwhelming reunion for Jon to come back like, \u201cBran, how are you?\u201d [And Bran goes], \u201cGreat.\u00a0I know everything and you\u2019re the heir to the Iron Throne.\u201d\u00a0Probably don\u2019t want that kind of delivery. Samwell Tarly. I think that\u2019ll be a little more interesting to play out on screen.\nIt looks like Jaime might be on the way to Winterfell, what do you want to see in a Bran and Jaime reunion?\nYeah,\u00a0I\u2019d love to see that. I think it could be interesting because clearly Jaime has now noticed that his lover and sister is completely fucking insane, and Jaime\u2019s been one of the most interesting character evolutions in the whole show. It\u2019s been fascinating to watch him develop.\u00a0From the outset, he was clearly morally reprehensible, but to see how ambiguous that actually is, and perhaps what a good person he is inside, has been really, really fun. I\u2019d be really interested to see his response to Bran, especially now that Bran knows everything about Jaime. Really freak Jaime out. I\u2019d like to see Jaime apologize. I think that\u2019d be really cool.\nWhere do you want to see Bran go in Season 8?\nI hope to make it through most of the episodes, but I also wouldn\u2019t mind getting to do a death scene now that it\u2019s the last season. I can rest easy knowing that I made it to the last season. But more than anything else, I\u2019d just like to see mankind triumph over the supernatural.\nOn \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d there\u2019s a lot of talk about \u201cbreaking the wheel.\u201d And we\u2019ve already seen the concept of a time loop introduced in Season 6. So I\u2019m theorizing that breaking the wheel could actually be breaking out of a time loop everyone\u2019s in. What do you think?\nOoohh! Damn! Damn! I like it! I like it! I\u2019ll email David [Benioff] and Dan [Weiss]. I\u2019ll see what we can [do].", "date": "\n08/30/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bran-stark-actor-says-cut-scene-wouldve-explained-confusing-game-of-thrones-finale-moment_n_59a5d56ee4b00795c2a26a71", "tags": "confusing see finale moment actor cut scene explained would \u201d season sansa says actually jaime thrones bran like littlefinger"}
