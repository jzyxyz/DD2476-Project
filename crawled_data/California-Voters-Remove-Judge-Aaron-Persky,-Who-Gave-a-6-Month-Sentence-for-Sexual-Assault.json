{"title": "California Voters Remove Judge Aaron Persky, Who Gave a 6-Month Sentence for Sexual Assault", "content": "Aaron Persky, the California judge who drew national attention in 2016 when he sentenced a Stanford student to just six months in jail for sexually assaulting an unconscious woman, was recalled on Tuesday, according to The Associated Press. He is the first judge recalled in California in more than 80 years.\nWith nearly all precincts reporting on Wednesday, just under 60 percent of voters were in favor of removing Judge Persky from the Santa Clara County Superior Court, where he had served since 2003. Cindy Hendrickson, a prosecutor, was elected to replace him.\nThe recall stemmed from the case of Brock Turner, who sexually assaulted a woman near a dumpster in 2015 after she had blacked out from drinking. In March 2016, a jury found Mr. Turner, then 20, guilty on all three felony charges against him: sexual penetration with a foreign object of an intoxicated person, sexual penetration with a foreign object of an unconscious person, and intent to commit rape.\nThe maximum sentence in Mr. Turner\u2019s case was 14 years, and Judge Persky had sentenced him to six months. Mr. Turner served only three months before being released in September 2016. (He also received three years of probation and was required to register as a sex offender, and Stanford forced him to withdraw and barred him from campus.)\n\u201cThe voters of Santa Clara County are the winners of this election,\u201d Michele Dauber, a law professor at Stanford who led the recall campaign, said in a statement. \u201cWe voted that sexual violence, including campus sexual violence, must be taken seriously by our elected officials, and by the justice system.\u201d\nLaDoris Cordell, a retired judge and a spokeswoman for Judge Persky, called the recall an attack on judicial independence and said it had \u201cencouraged people to think of judges as no more than politicians.\u201d\nThe judge said he thought Mr. Turner would \u201cnot be a danger to others\u201d and expressed concern that \u201ca prison sentence would have a severe impact\u201d on him. He did not mention the impact of the assault on the victim, known publicly only as Emily Doe, who described her suffering in a more than 7,000-word statement that went viral soon after it was published by BuzzFeed. The CNN host Ashleigh Banfield devoted more than 20 minutes of airtime to reading it almost in its entirety.\nJudge Persky was cleared of any official misconduct, but talk of a recall campaign began almost as soon as he handed down his sentence. Early this year, the Santa Clara County registrar announced that supporters of a recall \u2014 led by Ms. Dauber, whose daughter is friends with Emily Doe \u2014 had collected enough signatures to put the question on Tuesday\u2019s ballot. Among the effort\u2019s most prominent backers were Anita Hill and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York.\nIn a statement filed with the county registrar in response to the effort, Judge Persky said he had a legal and professional responsibility to consider alternatives to imprisonment for first-time offenders.\n\u201cAs a judge, my role is to consider both sides,\u201d he said in the statement. \u201cIt\u2019s not always popular, but it\u2019s the law, and I took an oath to follow it without regard to public opinion or my opinions as a former prosecutor.\u201d\nMs. Dauber said Tuesday\u2019s result \u201cdemonstrated that violence against women is a voting issue,\u201d and that \u201cif candidates want the votes of progressive Democratic women, they will have to take this issue seriously.\u201d\nOpponents of the recall, including some who disagreed with Judge Persky\u2019s decision in Mr. Turner\u2019s case, argued that this electoral punishment would make other judges reluctant to be lenient in cases where leniency might be appropriate.\n\u201cThey had a very emotional appeal: You say \u2018rape, dumpster, six months,\u2019 everyone goes \u2018ahhh\u2019 without looking at the facts,\u201d Ms. Cordell said, arguing that Judge Persky had been unfairly targeted by people whose real complaint was with California law at the time of Mr. Turner\u2019s sentencing.\nIn fact, the sentence, and the backlash to it, prompted California lawmakers to change the law. Within four months, they enacted mandatory minimum sentences in sexual assault cases and closed a loophole in which penetrative sexual assault could be punished less harshly if the victim was too intoxicated to physically resist.", "date": "June 6, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/06/us/politics/judge-persky-brock-turner-recall.html", "tags": "sentence gave aaron judge voters remove \u201d turner california months sexual recall persky assault"}
