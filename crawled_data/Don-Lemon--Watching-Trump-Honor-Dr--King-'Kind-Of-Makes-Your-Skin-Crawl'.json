{"title": "Don Lemon- Watching Trump Honor Dr- King 'Kind Of Makes Your Skin Crawl'", "content": "CNN anchor Don Lemon was astounded that President\u00a0Donald Trump could in all seriousness pay homage to civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr. a day after the president referred to Haiti and African nations as \u201cshithole\u201d countries.\n\u201cKind of makes your skin crawl,\u201d\u00a0said Lemon,\u00a0who contrasted Trump\u2019s words honoring King on Friday to the president\u2019s \u201cdisgraceful, racist\u201d comments Thursday.\n\u201cThe president has not apologized\u201d for the comments, Lemon noted. \u201cNo surprise.\u00a0Trying to deny that he used those words. But there\u2019s no denying it,\u201d Lemon added, referring to witnesses Rep. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Sen. Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.). They heard Trump say the words as he refused to protect immigration rights for people from those\u00a0\u201cshithole\u201d nations.\n\u201cIt\u2019s painfully ironic,\u00a0or for some, just plain painful,\u201d Lemon said, to hear what Trump had to say about the giant of the civil rights movement when the president signed a proclamation in the Oval Office honoring King\u00a0(shortly before a CNN reporter asked Trump if he was a racist).\nOn a video during the event, Trump said that Rev. King preached,\u00a0\u201clove\u00a0\u2014 love for each other, for neighbors and for our fellow Americans.\u201d He hailed King for \u201cstanding up for the self-evident truth that Americans hold so dear: That no matter what the color of our skin or the place of our birth, we are all created equal by God.\u201d\nLemon noted: \u201cKind of makes your skin crawl to hear him talk about Dr. Martin Luther King\u2019s values.\u201d\nKing\u2019s message, said Lemon, is \u201cjust as\u00a0 powerful today as it was 50 years ago.\u201d But \u201cDonald Trump has proved over and over with his words and actions that his presidency is a step backwards for race relations ... a step backwards from the real ideals of Dr. King: racial and economic justice.\u201d\nCheck out the rest of the segment above.", "date": "\n01/13/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/skin-crawl-trump-donlemon_n_5a598da3e4b03c418965bdfe", "tags": "crawl dr- makes president words rights \u201d trump skin lemon- king watching honor lemon"}
