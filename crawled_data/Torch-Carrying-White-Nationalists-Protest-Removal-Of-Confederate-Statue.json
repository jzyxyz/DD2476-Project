{"title": "Torch-Carrying White Nationalists Protest Removal Of Confederate Statue", "content": "White nationalists protesting the removal of a Robert E. Lee statue in Charlottesville, Virginia, stormed two of the city\u2019s parks on Saturday chanting Nazi slogans and brandishing torches.\u00a0\nDozens of protesters led by white nationalist Richard Spencer gathered in Jackson Park on Saturday afternoon and assembled again that night in the city\u2019s Lee Park, where they took up torches and surrounded the statue of Confederate general Lee slated for removal by the city council, according to reporters on the scene.\u00a0\nThe protesters chanted\u00a0\u201cYou will not replace us,\u201d \u201cRussia is our friend,\u201d \u201cAll white lives matter\u201d and the Nazi slogan \u201cBlood and soil,\u201d\u00a0MSNBC reported.\u00a0\nCharlottesville mayor Mike Signer (D) condemned the protest, both lashing out at Spencer on Twitter and issuing a statement against the group\u2019s intimidation tactics.\n\u201cThis event involving torches at night in Lee Park was either profoundly ignorant or was designed to instill fear in our minority populations in a way that hearkens back to the days of the KKK,\u201d Signer said. \u201cEither way, as mayor of this City, I want everyone to know this: we reject this intimidation. We are a Welcoming City, but such intolerance is not welcome here.\u201d\nOnetime Virginia congressman Tom Perriello, who\u2019s now running for the governor\u2019s office on an unapologetically progressive platform, denounced the protests as acts of hatred unleashed by the election of President Donald Trump.\u00a0\n\u201cAs much as we all wish this was an isolated incident, it\u2019s not,\u201d he said in an email to supporters. \u201cEmboldened by President Trump, this racism is spreading in our communities, our Commonwealth, and our country. After Trump\u2019s election, many of these racist leaders were given a platform and vindication. They want us to regress by decades.\u201d\nSpencer, an alumnus of the city\u2019s University of Virginia who is credited with originating the term\u00a0\u201calt right\u201d\u00a0in an attempt to rebrand white nationalism, claimed the protests were a way to preserve and celebrate his heritage.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cYou are not going to tear down the statue, and you are not going to replace us,\u201d he told local NBC affiliate WVIR\u00a0was his message to the city of Charlottesville.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an expression of force. It\u2019s an expression of occupying a space,\u201d said Spencer, who tweeted a photo of himself carrying a torch at the evening protest.\u00a0\nDuring a conference he hosted in November, Spencer famously yelled\u00a0\u201cHail Trump, hail our people, hail victory!\u201d to enthusiastic Nazi salutes from the crowd.\nThe fate of the Lee statue remains up in the air. After the city council voted to remove it in February, plaintiffs filed a lawsuit to stop its removal. A judge issued a temporary injunction earlier this month preventing the city from going through with the removal for the next six months.\u00a0", "date": "\n05/14/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/white-nationalist-statue-protest_n_5918a2d9e4b0031e737e63f1", "tags": "protest nationalists city confederate lee white torch-carrying \u201d spencer charlottesville statue removal"}
