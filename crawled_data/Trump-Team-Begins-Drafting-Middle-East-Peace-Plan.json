{"title": "Trump Team Begins Drafting Middle East Peace Plan", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump and his advisers have begun developing their own concrete blueprint to end the decades-old conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, a plan intended to go beyond previous frameworks offered by the American government in pursuit of what the president calls \u201cthe ultimate deal.\u201d\nAfter 10 months of educating themselves on the complexities of the world\u2019s most intractable dispute, White House officials said, Mr. Trump\u2019s team of relative newcomers to Middle East peacemaking has moved into a new phase of its venture in hopes of transforming what it has learned into tangible steps to end a stalemate that has frustrated even presidents with more experience in the region.\nThe prospects for peace are caught up in a web of other issues consuming the region, as demonstrated in recent days by Saudi Arabia\u2019s growing confrontation with Iranian-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon. Israel is likewise worried about Hezbollah as well as efforts by Iran to establish a land corridor across southern Syria. If a war with Hezbollah broke out, it could scuttle any initiative with the Palestinians.\nNonetheless, Mr. Trump\u2019s team has collected \u201cnon-papers\u201d exploring various issues related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and officials said they expected to address such perennial dividing points as the status of Jerusalem and settlements in the occupied West Bank. Although Mr. Trump has not committed to a Palestinian state, analysts said they anticipated that the plan will have to be built around the so-called two-state solution that has been the core of peacemaking efforts for years.\n\u201cWe have spent a lot of time listening to and engaging with the Israelis, Palestinians and key regional leaders over the past few months to help reach an enduring peace deal,\u201d said Jason D. Greenblatt, the president\u2019s chief negotiator. \u201cWe are not going to put an artificial timeline on the development or presentation of any specific ideas and will also never impose a deal. Our goal is to facilitate, not dictate, a lasting peace agreement to improve the lives of Israelis and Palestinians and security across the region.\u201d\nMr. Trump, who considers himself a dealmaker, decided to adopt the challenge when he took office in January, intrigued at the idea of succeeding where other presidents failed, and he assigned the effort to Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser. Neither had any background with the issue and the effort was greeted with scorn, but the fact that the president entrusted it to a close relative was taken as a sign of seriousness in the region.\nMr. Trump\u2019s team sees the convergence of factors that make the moment ripe, including an increased willingness by Arab states to finally solve the issue to refocus attention on Iran, which they consider the bigger threat. With that in mind, Egypt is brokering a reconciliation between Mahmoud Abbas, who presides in the West Bank, and Hamas, which controls Gaza, a deal that would cement the Palestinian Authority as the representative of the Palestinian people. Saudi Arabia has summoned Mr. Abbas to Riyadh to reinforce the importance of a deal.\n\u201cThe stars begin to align in a way that creates a moment,\u201d said Nimrod Novik, a fellow at the Israel Policy Forum who served as foreign policy adviser to former Prime Minister Shimon Peres, who negotiated the Oslo Accords in the 1990s. \u201cBut obviously the two key questions are will Prime Minister Netanyahu decide to go for it\u201d and \u201cwill President Trump, once he\u2019s presented a plan by his team, decide it\u2019s worth the political capital required.\u201d\nStill, neither Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel nor President Abbas of the Palestinian Authority is in a strong position to negotiate. Mr. Netanyahu faces corruption investigations and pressure from the right in his narrow coalition not to make concessions, while Mr. Abbas is aging and endures strong opposition among his own constituents.\nSkepticism abounds, especially among those who spent years struggling to overcome the same challenges with the same set of tools. President Barack Obama and his advisers debated for months putting forth their own parameters for a deal, ultimately outlining a general set of principles at the end of last year in a speech by Secretary of State John Kerry as time ran out on the administration.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing new under the sun when it comes to Middle East peace,\u201d said Philip Gordon, a White House Middle East coordinator under Mr. Obama. \u201cWhen you get into these details, that\u2019s when you come up against the strong objections of the two sides. If they don\u2019t want it to be dead on arrival, they may wind up with vague principles, but as we\u2019ve seen, even vague principles are beyond what the parties are willing to embrace.\u201d\nTamara Cofman Wittes, a State Department official under Mr. Obama, said both Israeli and Palestinian leaders \u201care heavily constrained\u201d not only by their own governing coalitions but by suspicious and risk-averse publics. \u201cIt\u2019s hard even for willing political leaders to make major concessions under those circumstances,\u201d she said.\nThe core four-member team drafting the plan includes Mr. Kushner, Mr. Greenblatt, Dina H. Powell, a deputy national security adviser, and David M. Friedman, the ambassador to Israel. They are consulting with Donald Blome, the consul general in Jerusalem, and others from the State Department and National Security Council. Officials said the effort may take until early next year.\nMr. Trump and his team make no bones about being pro-Israel. The president has boasted of being Israel\u2019s \u201cbiggest friend\u201d and Mr. Kushner, Mr. Greenblatt and Mr. Friedman are all Orthodox Jews with ties to Israel. But Ms. Powell is an Egyptian-born Coptic Christian and Mr. Kushner has developed strong ties with the Saudis and other Arabs and recently returned from a visit to Riyadh. Mr. Trump has met with Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Abbas three times each.\nThe team has drawn praise from across the spectrum. \u201cWe do believe this is a historic opportunity, and we will spare no effort to support President Trump\u2019s investment in a better future,\u201d Husam Zomlot, the Palestinian Authority\u2019s envoy to Washington, said in an interview. During a trip to London this month, Mr. Netanyahu said, \u201cThey are trying to think out of the box.\u201d\nBarak Ravid, an Israeli journalist who has broken stories on the American effort, wrote in the left-leaning Haaretz newspaper last spring that Mr. Trump had \u201csucceeded in bringing peace, which in recent years had become a dirty word, back to the center of Israeli public and political discourse.\u201d\nBut privately, officials from both sides express concern that Mr. Trump and his team are still na\u00efve about the Middle East and ineffective in accomplishing their objectives.\nDennis Ross, the veteran Middle East peace negotiator, said Mr. Trump\u2019s team has \u201cdone a very good job of presenting themselves as having listened\u201d and is now \u201ctaken seriously\u201d in the region.\nThe decision to present a concrete plan makes sense if ground is prepared in advance. \u201cIf you simply resume negotiations and nothing accompanies it, nobody will take it seriously,\u201d Mr. Ross said. \u201cPeople will say we\u2019ve seen this movie before. You have to show people \u2014 no, something is different this time.\u201d\nSome analysts said they believed Mr. Trump\u2019s plan may come with confidence-building provisions that each side will already have agreed to. For Israel, it could include limiting settlement construction to current blocs without taking new land, recommitting to a two-state solution and redesignating a small part of the West Bank to give Palestinians more control.\nFor the Palestinians, it could include resuming full security cooperation with Israel, holding off seeking further international recognition and ending payments to families of Palestinians imprisoned for terrorist attacks. Arab states, particularly Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan, could add their own commitments, like overflights by Israeli passenger planes, visas for business people and telecommunications links.\nA White House official dismissed that as mere speculation. But the challenges of getting even to that stage are formidable, much less tackling harder questions.\nMr. Zomlot, the Palestinian envoy, said any plan must establish a sovereign Palestinian state along the borders from before the 1967 Arab-Israeli war with East Jerusalem as its capital. \u201cThis is not our maximum. This is our minimum,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat everybody needs to understand is the historic compromise has already been made.\u201d\nIsrael\u2019s allies in Washington are pressing from the other side. The House Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday will consider a bill to cut aid to the Palestinian Authority unless it ends payments to families of Palestinian attackers.\n\u201cIf the Palestinians are going to be trustworthy partners in any kind of peace discussion, they have to show that they\u2019re not inciting terrorism,\u201d said Representative Doug Lamborn, a Republican from Colorado sponsoring the legislation. \u201cAnd when you pay people \u2014 and, in fact, if you pay them more, the more Jews they kill \u2014 that\u2019s pure incitement to terrorism.\u201d\nPalestinian leaders say the payments are meant to help destitute families, not promote terrorism, and they accuse Israel of subsidizing violence by encouraging settlers in the West Bank. One compromise floated recently would have the Palestinian Authority help those families through a general welfare program that does not prioritize relatives of prisoners.\nStill, some analysts think Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Abbas are simply playing along with the goal of ensuring the other is blamed when the process collapses.\n\u201cThe biggest impediment to the peace process is the two leaders,\u201d said Grant Rumley, a scholar at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. \u201cUltimately, both Netanyahu and Abbas just have this long, long history and they\u2019ve played this game really well. And they don\u2019t trust each other and I don\u2019t think they will ever get to the point where they will trust each other.\u201d", "date": "Nov. 11, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/11/world/middleeast/trump-peace-israel-palestinians.html", "tags": "palestinian drafting \u201c palestinians middle team peace israel trump begins plan said east"}
