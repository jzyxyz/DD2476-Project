{"title": "Trump's Latest Health Care Move Will Cause Pain, But Not For The Poor", "content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to halt a series of payments to health insurers could eventually affect millions of Americans who buy coverage through one of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s exchanges or on their own, directly from insurers. \nBut for now, at least, the decision is likely to affect one group in particular. And it\u2019s not the group you might expect.\nThe payments, known as \u201ccost-sharing reductions,\u201d or CSRs, reimburse insurers for special plans they offer to low-income consumers. Those payments, worth $7 billion this year alone, have been the subject of an ongoing legal dispute over whether the federal government has authority to spend that money.\n A federal district judge issued an initial ruling blocking the payments in 2015, but an appeal on the case is pending \u2015 and in the meantime, the president basically gets to decide whether to make the payments. President Barack Obama said yes. Now Trump is saying no.\nBecause low-income consumers are the primary beneficiaries of the payments Trump just stopped, many politicians and pundits are saying it\u2019s low-income consumers who will have to pay more for their coverage.\u00a0That\u2019s not correct.\u00a0For the time being, the people who end up paying more will tend to be middle- or upper-middle-class consumers.\nThat\u2019s because, by eliminating those insurance payments, Trump will trigger an increase in another form of financial subsidy that the Affordable Care Act created.\u00a0And that leads to some counterintuitive results.\nHealth insurers selling through one of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s exchanges, whether it\u2019s healthcare.gov or one of the state exchanges like Covered California, offer plans in four different tiers: bronze, silver, gold and platinum. Bronze is the least generous. It\u2019s basically a catastrophic plan where, except for three routine doctor visits per year, beneficiaries pay every medical bill until they hit a high deductible. Platinum plans look like a really generous employer plan, with low co-pays and deductibles. \u00a0\nThese plans are available to anyone buying health care on the exchanges. People whose incomes are below 400 percent of the poverty line ($98,400 for a family of four) qualify for tax credits that discount some or all of the premiums. The tax credits get bigger as premiums do, in the hopes of keeping insurance affordable. The formula for determining those tax credits uses the premiums for a \u201ctypical\u201d plan \u2015 which, for each market, the law defines as the second-cheapest silver plan on the exchanges. \u00a0\nThese insurers sell other plans, too \u2015 among them, a special set of silver plans that come with lower deductibles and co-payments. These are available only to people with incomes below 250 percent of the poverty line, or $61,500 for a family of four. The Affordable Care Act requires insurers to offer these plans, which are more expensive to provide because they cover more. The CSR funds are supposed to reimburse the carriers for that extra cost.\nThere\u2019s one more kind of plan insurers offer: plans that they sell directly to consumers, through their own websites, or through insurance brokers. On paper, many of these plans look like the ones insurers sell through the exchanges, with one critical difference: People who buy them can\u2019t get the tax credits that discount premiums. They will pay the full sticker price, however high it gets. Not surprisingly, most of the people buying coverage this way make too much to qualify for tax credits anyway. \nThat\u2019s how everything is supposed to work. But now, thanks to Trump stopping the CSRs,\u00a0insurers have a problem. By law,\u00a0they still have to offer those special silver plans with low deductibles and low co-pays to the people who qualify for them. And without the CSRs, they are going to lose money on these plans.\u00a0\nIn response,\u00a0insurers are raising premiums, but not necessarily on all plans. Working with state regulators,\u00a0the majority of insurers have\u00a0decided to increase only the prices of their silver plans \u2015 and in many cases only those plans they sell through the exchanges. (At the moment, nobody has a reliable count of exactly how many.)\u00a0The tax credits increase right along with the premiums for the silver plans, so people buying them won\u2019t have to pay more.\u00a0Prices for the other plans aren\u2019t changing.\nAnd here\u2019s the truly bizarre part: People who qualify for the premium tax credits can use those tax credits to buy any plan they want. With much bigger tax credits, some of them will discover that a more-generous gold plan costs less than they would pay for a less-generous silver plan.\nThis setup, which some analysts are calling the \u201csilver switcharoo,\u201d sounds like a great deal \u2015 except, perhaps, for taxpayers, because the new federal spending on larger tax credits is likely to exceed any savings from cutting off CSRs. But there\u2019s a lot more to the story.\nNot every insurer and state is approaching the problem this way. In places where insurers raise premiums on all plans, consumers at higher income levels will certainly end up paying more for equivalent plans \u2015 and many of them already pay extremely high premiums for their coverage.\nTo be clear, insurers don\u2019t seem particularly happy about this situation. They are losing CSR payments for October, November and December of this year and it\u2019s too late to increase premiums in response. The big carriers can absorb that pretty easily. They can even sue the government, because the law entitles them to the payments even if Congress never appropriated the funds. But smaller insurers will have a harder time with the losses, and they can\u2019t wait two years or more for a case to work its way through the courts.\u00a0\nRegardless, Trump\u2019s decision has gotten their attention \u2015 and not in a good way. It\u2019s the clearest signal yet that he has zero interest in making the newly reformed insurance markets work and that, as former White House adviser Steve Bannon admitted over the weekend, Trump is actively trying to \u201cblow up\u201d the markets.\nProviding insurance through the Affordable Care Act has not been an easy endeavor. Healthy people aren\u2019t enrolling in the numbers everybody had hoped, making it difficult to balance the books. Officials in many states have been uncooperative or downright hostile. And, at the behest of congressional Republicans, the federal government failed to make another set of payments that insurers were supposed to get.\nA critical mass of insurers has remained in the program because, as of this year,\u00a0their\u00a0financials were finally improving and they could see the makings of the stable,\u00a0profitable market that the law\u2019s architects always envisioned. But that future was dependent on an administration that wanted the program to succeed. The Trump administration feels differently, and insurers will be thinking about that, hard, in the spring when they make their decisions about whether to stay in the program for 2019 and beyond.", "date": "\n10/16/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-affordable-care-act_n_59e505f0e4b02a215b322ad5", "tags": "credits latest cause tax silver insurers plan poor premiums trump move payments pain plans care health"}
