{"title": "These Are The Types Of Islamophobia Fox News Is OK With", "content": "\u201cThink about it. [Rep. Ilhan] Omar wears a hijab,\u201d Fox News host Jeanine Pirro looked straight into the camera and told her viewers Saturday night. \u201cWhich, according to the Quran 33:59, tells women to cover so they won\u2019t get molested. Is her adherence to this Islamic doctrine indicative of her adherence to Sharia law, which in itself is antithetical to the United States Constitution?\u201d\nHer on-air comments, which explicitly questioned Omar\u2019s loyalty\u00a0as an American lawmaker simply because of her religious beliefs, were widely criticized, with civil rights groups nationwide calling for Pirro\u2019s resignation. Her employer even condemned\u00a0her comments in a statement released on Sunday, saying they \u201cdo not reflect those of the network.\u201d \nOmar\u00a0(D-Minn.), one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress, later thanked the network\u00a0on Twitter for its condemnation. Shortly after that, Pirro released a statement defending her segment, saying that she did not call Omar un-American and that her \u201cintention was to ask a question and start a debate, but of course because one is Muslim does not mean you don\u2019t support the Constitution.\u201d\nBut to say Pirro\u2019s comments do not reflect Fox News\u2019 position is far from the truth. For years, she has propagated anti-Muslim disinformation without any consequence \u2014 and so have her colleagues throughout the network. Fox News has amassed a well-documented history of spewing anti-Muslim propaganda with impunity.\nIn a 2016 segment of \u201cFox News Live,\u201d Pirro advocated for mosques to be surveilled and supported Newt Gingrich\u2019s call to \u201ctest every person here who is of a Muslim background, and if they believe in Sharia, they should be deported,\u201d\u00a0as he told the network\u2019s Sean Hannity.\nIn 2015 she invited a Steve Emerson, a \u201chigh-profile Muslim-basher,\u201d\u00a0according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, to discuss his since-disproved theory\u00a0about so-called no-go zones in the U.K. and France; he claimed Muslims who refuse to assimilate reside in enclaves that are beyond the control of local law enforcement and even bar non-Muslims from entering.\nAfter the 2015 Charlie Hebdo attack in France, Pirro\u2019s show promoted bigoted inaccuracies \u2014 among many during Fox News\u2019 coverage. The network was forced to issue not one but four corrections in a single day for wildly inaccurate reporting\u00a0about Muslims in Europe. \nThat year, she went on a seven-minute Islamophobia-riddled tirade\u00a0in which she said a \u201creverse Crusade\u201d was in progress against white Christians. In another instance, she called for the mass murder of Islamists \u2014 a label used to describe politicians who run on political platforms influenced by the Islamic faith. \nA few days after the 2015 National Prayer Breakfast, a national interfaith event held in Washington, D.C., Pirro again took to her show and collectively blamed Muslims, a community of 1.6 billion people, for a series of terrorist attacks. She berated then-President Obama to \u201cstop defending Islam\u201d and to \u201cstart protecting Americans.\u201d \n\u201cConsider this: The first World Trade Center attack in 1993, by Muslims. The USS Cole bombers were Muslim. The Fort Hood shooter was Muslim. The shoe bomber was Muslim. The underwear bomber was Muslim. The Boston bombers were Muslim. The Sept. 11 hijackers were Muslim,\u201d she said. \u201cMr. President, please identify what other violence is being committed against Americans in the name of any other religion, or is it just coincidence?\u201d\nFox News has repeatedly pushed anti-Muslim conspiracy theories, hosted numerous Islamophobic personalities and consistently weaved in blatant hate and bigotry in its coverage of Muslims.\u00a0\nA Fox News representative told HuffPost that these instances occurred under old management.\u00a0\nMedia Matters, a nonprofit research center dedicated to monitoring and correcting misinformation in American media, has long documented Fox News\u2019\u00a0Islamophobic history.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely not isolated to her show. That\u2019s a given,\u201d said Rebecca Lenn, Media Matters\u2019 director of external affairs. \u201cFox News has definitely been a leading driver of the anti-Muslim fervor in the media landscape for a long time. There is no doubt, taking a step back, that bigotry and extremism are at the very heart of the network, and that\u2019s becoming even more of a reality since the network has positioned itself as Trump\u2019s go-to propaganda network.\u201d\nThere is no shortage of examples of blatant anti-Muslim rhetoric broadcast on Fox News.\u00a0\nOn \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d co-host Brian Kilmeade claimed in 2010 that \u201call terrorists are Muslims.\u201d In another episode of the same program that year, co-host Pete Hegseth had some advice for the Muslim community, saying, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to be portrayed in a negative light, maybe don\u2019t burn people alive and set off bombs and things like that.\u201d\n\u201cMuslim immigration means more Islamic terrorism,\u201d said Pamela Geller\u00a0on Sean Hannity\u2019s show in 2017. The Southern Poverty Law Center designated her \u201cthe anti-Muslim movement\u2019s most visible and flamboyant figurehead.\u201d \n\u201cYou have to admit, there is a Muslim problem in the world,\u201d\u00a0Jesse Watters said on \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor\u201d in 2017.\nThe anti-Muslim hatred goes back for years. In 2010, when Muslim Americans wanted to construct an Islamic center known as Park51 in lower Manhattan, Fox News commentators regularly demonized idea in a number of segments. In August of that year, Fox News legal analyst Peter Johnson said New York Muslims should \u201cgive up their rights\u201d in order to be \u201cgood neighbors.\u201d One month later, Fox News host Bill Hemmer said the center \u201ccould also be the first stop for a radical jihadist who comes to America who wants to go pray.\u201d \nWhile Obama was running for president and throughout his time in the White House, Fox News anchors continually recycled the narrative that he was a Muslim (he isn\u2019t), insinuating that just being of the Islamic faith would be problematic.\nAs with Pirro\u2019s recent smear against Omar, former Fox News contributor Eric Bolling claimed in 2012 that Obama was a Muslim who \u201canswered to the Quran first and to the Constitution second.\u201d \nOther examples of Fox News\u2019 perpetuation of anti-Muslim hysteria include pushing the conspiracy that Sharia, a religious framework that Muslims adhere to in everyday life, is set to take over the U.S. government and replace it with a violent, backward legal framework. (No national Muslim organization has ever called for Sharia to supersede American courts. In fact, the sheer idea goes against how Sharia actually works.)\nLenn said Pirro\u2019s latest comments are just another example of an overarching problem at Fox News that is unlikely to end anytime soon. \n\u201cFox News\u2019 condemnation of her remarks is definitely disingenuous. Pirro is going to continue to push these narratives forward, and so will other Fox News hosts,\u201d Lenn said. \u201cNo doubt has Fox News at its core driven the Islamophobia problem that we see today and has mainstreamed it.\u201d\nThis story has been updated to include a comment from Fox News.\nCORRECTIONS: A previous version of this story stated incorrectly that Brian Kilmeade claimed in 2017 that \u201call terrorists are Muslims\u201d (he made the comment in 2010) and that Eric Bolling is a Fox News contributor (he is no longer with the network).", "date": "\n03/12/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/fox-news-islamophobia_n_5c8811ebe4b038892f482d12?74", "tags": "anti-muslim fox network news muslims ok islamophobia \u201d types muslim pirro"}
