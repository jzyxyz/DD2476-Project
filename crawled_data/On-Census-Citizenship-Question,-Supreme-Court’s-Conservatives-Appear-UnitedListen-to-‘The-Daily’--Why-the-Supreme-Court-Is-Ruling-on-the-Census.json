{"title": "On Census Citizenship Question, Supreme Court\u2019s Conservatives Appear UnitedListen to \u2018The Daily\u2019: Why the Supreme Court Is Ruling on the Census", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court\u2019s conservative majority seemed ready on Tuesday to allow the Trump administration to add a question on citizenship to the 2020 census, which critics say would undermine its accuracy by discouraging both legal and unauthorized immigrants from filling out the forms.\nThe case, the latest test of executive power in the Trump era, was heard by the court against the backdrop of the administration\u2019s aggressive efforts to reduce illegal immigration as well as accusations of bad faith against the architect of the revised census questionnaire, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. It appeared to divide the court along the usual lines, with its five conservative members poised to defer to the administration and the court\u2019s four liberal members ready to question its motives and methods.\nThe court\u2019s decision, expected in late June, will be consequential. By one government estimate, about 6.5 million people might not be counted if the citizenship question is allowed. That could reduce Democratic representation when congressional districts are allocated in 2021 and affect how hundreds of billions of dollars in federal spending are distributed. Courts have also found that Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, New York and Texas could risk losing seats in the House, and that several states could lose federal money.\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, who took the lead in challenging the administration\u2019s proposal, said that adding the question would do damage to the fundamental purpose of the census, which is to count everyone in the nation. \u201cThere is no doubt that people will respond less,\u201d she said. \u201cThat has been proven in study after study.\u201d\n[How the Supreme Court\u2019s decision on the census could alter American politics.]\nSolicitor General Noel J. Francisco, representing the Trump administration, acknowledged that the question could depress participation. But he said the information it would yield was valuable.\n\u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d he said, \u201cif you add any particular question onto the census, you\u2019re always trading off information and accuracy.\u201d\nHow to strike that balance, he said, was a policy judgment properly made by Mr. Ross. The more conservative justices appeared to agree.\nJustice Neil M. Gorsuch noted that questions about citizenship had been asked on many census forms over the years and are commonplace around the world.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like anybody in the room is suggesting the question is improper to ask in some way, shape or form,\u201d Justice Gorsuch said. \u201cAnd what we do, as well, with the evidence of practice around the world and virtually every English-speaking country and a great many others besides ask this question in their censuses?\u201d\nJustice Brett M. Kavanaugh also discussed international trends. \u201cThe United Nations recommends that countries ask a citizenship question on the census,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd a number of other countries do it. Spain, Germany, Canada, Australia, Ireland and Mexico ask a citizenship question.\u201d\nBarbara D. Underwood, New York\u2019s solicitor general, representing states and localities challenging Mr. Ross\u2019s decision, responded that \u201cthe U.N. also says to be careful to test questions to make sure they don\u2019t interfere with the enumeration.\u201d\nShe said the court should protect the accuracy of the census form given that information about citizenship can be obtained in other ways.\n\u201cThe question,\u201d she said, \u201cis whether it should be collected on the very instrument whose principal function is to count the population, when we have such strong evidence that it will depress that count and make it less accurate.\u201d\nMuch of the argument, which lasted 80 minutes rather than the usual hour, concerned statistical modeling. \u201cThis gets really, really technical,\u201d Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. said in a frustrated voice.\nThe case \u2014 United States Department of Commerce v. New York, No. 18-966 \u2014 has its roots in the text of the Constitution, which requires an \u201cactual enumeration\u201d every 10 years, with the House of Representatives to be apportioned based on \u201cthe whole number of persons in each state.\u201d\nIn addition to counting the number of people in the nation, the census has also sought other kinds of information. Whatever the Supreme Court rules, the 2020 short form will include questions about sex, age, race and Hispanic or Latino origin. Some of those questions may discourage participation, too.\nDale E. Ho, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, said the citizenship question would do more than suppress the response rate. It would also introduce inaccuracies, he said. \u201cThe evidence shows,\u201d he said, \u201cthat noncitizens respond to the question inaccurately one-third of the time.\u201d\nThe more liberal justices said that was a reason to defer to expert statisticians in the Census Bureau who opposed adding the question.\nJustice Elena Kagan said she could not understand why Mr. Ross had rejected the conclusions of his own experts. \u201cI searched the record,\u201d she said, \u201cand I don\u2019t see any reason.\u201d\nMr. Francisco said the evidence supplied by the experts was not definitive. \u201cLook,\u201d he said, \u201cthere\u2019s no question that the bureau staff preferred not to have this question on the census. But what they were telling the secretary was that they couldn\u2019t tell which model would be more or less accurate.\u201d\nThe federal government has long gathered information about citizenship. But since 1950, it has not included a question about it in the census forms sent once a decade to each household. Mr. Ross, the commerce secretary, has said he ordered the citizenship question to be added back solely in response to a December 2017 request from the Justice Department, which said data about citizenship would help it enforce the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\nThree federal trial judges have ruled that the evidence in the record demonstrates that Mr. Ross was not telling the truth. He had long before decided to add the question, the judges found, and he pressured the Justice Department to supply a rationale.\nJustice Sotomayor suggested Mr. Ross had manufactured the reason. \u201cThis is a solution in search of a problem,\u201d she said.\nMr. Francisco rejected that critique. \u201cIt is quite common,\u201d he said, \u201cfor cabinet secretaries to come into office with ideas and inclinations to discuss with their staff and discuss with their colleagues whether there is a legal and policy basis for that inclination.\u201d\nDocuments disclosed in the case showed that Mr. Ross had discussed the citizenship issue early in his tenure with Stephen K. Bannon, the former White House chief strategist and an architect of the Trump administration\u2019s tough policies against immigrants, and that Mr. Ross had met at Mr. Bannon\u2019s direction with Kris Kobach, the former Kansas secretary of state and a vehement opponent of unlawful immigration.\nBut Mr. Francisco said the Justice Department\u2019s request was the key to the case. \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence in this record that the secretary would have asked this question had the Department of Justice not requested it,\u201d Mr. Francisco said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s no evidence in this record that the secretary didn\u2019t believe that the Department of Justice actually wanted this information to improve Voting Rights Act enforcement.\u201d\nJustice Kagan said the record contained plenty of evidence that Mr. Ross had been \u201cshopping for a need\u201d to ask the question by approaching both the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security.\nShe described Mr. Ross\u2019s efforts: \u201cGoes to the Justice Department. Justice Department says we don\u2019t need anything. Goes to D.H.S. D.H.S. says they don\u2019t need anything. Goes back to the Justice Department. Makes it clear that he\u2019s going to put in a call to the attorney general. Finally, the Justice Department comes back to him and says, \u2018O.K., we can give you what you want.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cSo you can\u2019t read this record without sensing,\u201d Justice Kagan said, \u201cthat this need is a contrived one.\u201d\nThe Supreme Court heard the case on an expedited schedule, stepping in before any appeals court had ruled on the matter. The court\u2019s speed was almost certainly a result of a looming deadline \u2014 the census forms are set to be printed in June.", "date": "April 23, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/23/us/politics/supreme-court-census-citizenship.html", "tags": "census \u2018 court daily department \u201d supreme ruling justice citizenship unitedlisten conservatives appear question"}
