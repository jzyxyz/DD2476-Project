{"title": "Christchurch shootings: NZ police admit error in naming murder charge victim", "content": "New Zealand police have admitted that the person named on a charge sheet as the murder victim of the alleged Christchurch mosques attacker is actually alive.\nThey said the naming on the document for the first court appearance of Australian Brenton Tarrant, 28, was an administrative error.\nThe attacks left 50 dead but only one charge of murder was initially brought.\nThe error would not affect the legal case, police said.\nPolice Minister Stuart Nash told New Zealand's RNZ: \"It was an administrative error, it will have no impact whatsoever on the court process, I understand it's been rectified. Let's bring this guy to justice.\"\nPolice said they had apologised to the person incorrectly named on the charging document, which would be amended. The person's name has been suppressed by a court order.\nThe defendant appeared in court on Saturday. He was remanded in custody without a plea and is due in court again on 5 April.\nFifty people lost their lives in the shootings at two mosques in the city. \nLaw Prof Warren Brookbanks, from Auckland University, said there was no risk the accused could be released.\n\"They can alter the charges, they can have the information withdrawn and have the fresh information, which has the proper facts\u2026 In the circumstances and given the nature of the offences, I don't think there's any chance he's going to be released,\" he told RNZ. \nAll of the victims have now been formally identified, police have confirmed.\nThe attack on two mosques in Christchurch on 15 March was the deadliest in the country's history.", "date": "21 March 2019", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-47649833", "tags": "victim mosques admit charge murder shootings court person new zealand naming christchurch police named nz error"}
