{"title": "What We Know About Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov, Suspect In The Deadly NYC Attack", "content": "PATERSON, N.J. \u2015 Police have identified 29-year-old Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov as the suspected driver who plowed a Home Depot rental pickup into a bike path in lower Manhattan on Tuesday afternoon, killing at least eight people and injuring at least 12 more. He is a self-described member of the Islamic State,\u00a0and was charged Wednesday with one count of material support to a terrorist organization and violence and destruction of a motor vehicle.\nThe details surrounding Saipov\u2019s time in the United States remained murky in the hours after the attack. He emigrated legally from Uzbekistan in 2010, first getting his bearings with family friends in Ohio, and has reportedly lived in several states since.\nSaipov apparently had been planning his attack for several weeks and acted in the name of ISIS,\u00a0John Miller, the New York Police Department deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism, said Wednesday during a news conference. Saipov \u2015 who was not previously the subject of an FBI or NYPD investigation \u2015 may have \u201ctouched subjects of other investigations,\u201d Miller said.\u00a0\nPolice found multiple knives in the vehicle, in addition to two imitation weapons on the scene, Miller added. The department said the suspect left notes indicating his belief that ISIS would \u201cendure forever.\u201d\u00a0\nWhile recovering from a gunshot wound at a hospital in New York, Saipov asked investigators if he could display ISIS flags in his room, according to a complaint\u00a0 released by the United States Attorney Southern District of New York. In court papers, prosecutors noted Saipov said \u201che felt good about what he had done.\u201d\u00a0\nThe suspect had planned to put ISIS flags on his vehicle but later thought better of it, afraid it would draw attention to him, the complaint says. The Associated Press notes Saipov\u2019s cellphones contained about 90 videos and 3,800 photos, many related to ISIS. The images included content of ISIS prisoners being beheaded, shot or run over by a tank.\nPresident Donald Trump referred to Saipov as a \u201cvery sick and deranged person.\u201d\u00a0New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the suspect had been radicalized in the U.S. Shortly before midnight on Wednesday, the president tweeted that Saipov \u201cSHOULD GET THE DEATH PENALTY!\u201d\nPeople who knew Saipov \u2015 albeit vaguely \u2015\u00a0offered differing descriptions of him,\u00a0with some calling him calm and one person characterizing him as \u201csometimes aggressive.\u201d\nSaipov passed a background check to become an Uber driver in New Jersey, the ride-sharing company said in statement provided to HuffPost. He was an active driver at the time of the attack,\u00a0having recorded over 1,400 trips in six months, but has since been banned from the app, Uber said.\u00a0\n\u201cWe are aggressively and quickly reviewing this partner\u2019s history with Uber, and at this time we have not identified any related concerning safety reports,\u201d the company said, adding that it has been in contact with the FBI.\nLyft also said Wednesday that Saipov had been registered as a driver on the ride-hailing app but did not specify when or for how long.\nSaipov had traffic citations in Missouri \u2015 he was arrested after not showing up in court for a misdemeanor offense \u2015 and Pennsylvania, according to\u00a0online records. His driver\u2019s license reportedly was issued in Florida.\u00a0\nAn address from 2015 also linked Saipov\u2019s name to Stow, Ohio, but he had reportedly been\u00a0living in Paterson, New Jersey, for the past few months with his wife and two children.\nCarlos Batista, 23, one of the family\u2019s neighbors in Paterson, first saw a Home Depot truck parked outside Saipov\u2019s apartment building about three weeks ago, he told HuffPost. He said Saipov would get in the truck with the same two men almost every day, usually around 9 a.m., and return in the afternoon. All of the men had long beards, Batista said, but only Saipov wore a long robe.\u00a0\nBatista said his interactions with Saipov were mostly limited to neighborly hellos and waves. Once, though, he said he got into a small altercation with the men who rode in the truck with Saipov.\u00a0They men were upset with Batista for riding a noisy dirt bike up and down the street,\u00a0Batista said.\u00a0\nBatista said they gave him some attitude, so he gave some attitude back. That\u2019s when Saipov stepped outside.\u00a0\n\u201cHe was the peacemaker,\u201d Batista said of Saipov. \u201cHe calmed everything down.\u201d\u00a0\nFrom what he could tell, Batista said, Saipov seemed like a \u201cgood guy.\u201d\nAn Uzbek immigrant who knew Saipov agreed. \u201cHe was a very good person when I knew him,\u201d Kobiljon Matkarov told The New York Times. \u201cHe liked the U.S. He seemed very lucky and all the time he was happy and talking like everything is OK. He did not seem like a terrorist, but I did not know him from the inside.\u201d\nAnother acquaintance from Cincinnati, whose family housed Saipov for several weeks in 2010 as he tried to get his green card, described him as hard-working and introverted.\n\u201cHe was really calm,\u201d Dilnoza Abdusamatova told The Cincinnati Enquirer. \u201cHe always used to work. He wouldn\u2019t go to parties or anything. He only used to come home and rest and leave and go back to work.\u201d\nHe left after two weeks and moved to Florida, she added.\u00a0However,\u00a0public records from 2011 show a business, Sayf Motors Inc., registered under his name at Abdusamatova\u2019s home address in Ohio.\u00a0\nSaipov was \u201cspontaneously religious,\u201d Mirrakhmat Muminov,\u00a0a truck driver and Uzbek community activist who lives in Stow, Ohio, told Reuters.\u00a0\n\u201cHe started studying religion in the United States.\u00a0He was withdrawn, nervous, sometimes aggressive,\u201d\u00a0Muminov said. \u201cBecause of that he was lonely, he lived in his own world. He was not very popular.\u201d\nSaipov drove down the bike path along the West Side Highway and hit multiple bikers and pedestrians, police say. He then drove the truck into a Stuyvesant High School bus before exiting the vehicle and waving what police described as \u201cimitation firearms.\u201d He was confronted by a New York City police officer, shot and then taken to a hospital.\u00a0He remained in police custody at Bellevue Hospital as of Wednesday.\n\u201cHopefully people don\u2019t go \u2018round discriminating against Muslim people or Arabic people,\u201d said Angel Batista, Carlos\u2019 older brother. \u201cThis is a Muslim community. We have the mosque, a lot of schools for Muslims ... They\u2019re not bad people. They\u2019re nice genuine people willing give up what they have for other people.\u201d\nAhmad, a 46-year-old truck driver from Jersey City who asked to be identified only by his first name for security reasons,\u00a0found the gate locked when he arrived to pray at Omar Mosque on Wednesday. The mosque is believed to be where Saipov worshipped, according to multiple media reports.\u00a0\nAhmad apologized for his English not being good enough to express how disgusted he was by Saipov\u2019s actions.\n\u201cIn our religion,\u201d he told HuffPost, \u201cif you kill a cat, you go to hell. How [can you] you kill innocent people?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Ahmad added. \u201cHe is not a Muslim. If he is doing that he not a Muslim.\u201d\nHe added that \u201cvery, very few people\u201d misunderstand Islam, saying that\u00a0\u201cthey give the world a bad picture of Muslims.\u201d\nThis is a developing story.
