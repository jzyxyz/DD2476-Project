Angela Merkel, the Continent\u2019s most powerful figure, is expected to win a fourth term as chancellor after a colorless campaign. Yet if many Germans seem satisfied enough with their leader, others are unhappy with the wishy-washy consensus of the main political parties.\nTroubled by her migration policy and her long tenure, some Germans are turning more toward smaller, more ideological parties. For the first time in more than 60 years, they are expected to vote a far-right, anti-immigration party \u2014 the Alternative for Germany, known by its German initials, AfD \u2014 into the federal Parliament.\nIn recent weeks, the party has regained lost ground in the opinion polls. It could emerge as Germany\u2019s third-largest party \u2014 and even become the leader of the opposition, if the current coalition of the two largest parties falls apart.\nSuch a scenario would represent a big shift in the consensus-driven style of politics in Germany. And the historical import is undeniable in a country still shadowed by the Nazi legacy of World War II, which is why the election is generating some angst.\nEven the party\u2019s entrance into Parliament \u201cwould be a dramatic milestone,\u201d said Frank Decker, a political scientist from the University of Bonn. \u201cIn the past there were a few individual old Nazis who made it into the national Parliament, but there has never been a party on the far-right of the political spectrum.\u201d\nFar-right parties have held seats in state legislatures and municipal councils in Germany for decades. But since the federal Parliament of West Germany was established in 1949 after the Nazi defeat in World War II, no party to the right of the Christian Democratic Union has surpassed the 5 percent threshold necessary to win seats there.\nSeveral polls estimate that the AfD, which has morphed from an anti-euro currency party to one opposed to immigration, will win 10 percent to even 15 percent of the vote.\nMs. Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats \u2014 who vote as a bloc with their Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union \u2014 remain on track to emerge as the strongest party, with about 36 percent of the vote. The Social Democrats \u2014 whose leader, Martin Schulz, has struggled to differentiate himself from Ms. Merkel after his party has ruled together with hers for the last four years \u2014 are estimated to win about 22 percent.\nEntrance into Parliament would also strengthen the AfD by making it eligible for public financing and increasing its visibility. Its members would serve on parliamentary committees and would force more established political parties to respond more clearly on issues like immigration and redefining the national identity.\n\u201cThe AfD has already sharply changed the discourse, as can be seen from the election campaign,\u201d said Niko Switek, a professor at the NRW School of Governance at the University of Duisburg-Essen. \u201cGerman politics have become polarized again.\u201d\nYes and no. The main German parties are solidly pro-European and the campaign has actually been criticized as too dull, leaving room for smaller, more extreme parties, like the AfD and the Left party, the inheritor of the East German Communist Party, to make inroads.\nGerd Feichtinger, a sanitation technician who was born in the former East Germany, said that after decades of supporting the chancellor\u2019s conservatives, the AfD was getting his vote.\n\u201cI want to finally see a real opposition in Parliament,\u201d he said in a phone interview from his home near the former West German capital of Bonn. \u201cWhatever happens, Ms. Merkel has to go. I am going to do what I can to make that happen.\u201d\nAt the same time, representation for the AfD in parliament, given Germany\u2019s complicated system of proportional representation, would acknowledge democratic reality and give 10 percent or more of the Germans, who like Mr. Feichtinger feel isolated and alienated, a voice in the national political debate.\nThe AfD remains strongest in the formerly Communist east and has dealt the Christian Democrats humiliating election defeats in state elections there. But it has failed to do as well in the west, although it entered the regional Parliament of the most populous state, North-Rhine Westphalia, for the first time in May.\nAs campaigning began in the summer, the immigration issue had largely slipped out of the collective consciousness, the party\u2019s support dipped into the single digits from the near 20 percent it enjoyed just after the arrival of nearly a million refugees in 2015.\nBut after the only televised debate between Ms. Merkel and Mr. Schulz focused heavily on the immigration issue \u2014 revealing the similarities in their position \u2014 the AfD appeared to gain again, said one pollster, Nico Siegel, of Infratest dimap.\n\u201cThere was hardly any difference in their positions,\u201d Mr. Siegel said.\nFour smaller parties, up from the current two, are expected to make it into Parliament: the AfD; the liberal Free Democrats, who are running almost neck-and-neck for third place; the Greens; and the Left party. But a significant number of voters say that they remain undecided.\nMs. Merkel could face a tough choice between two options for forming a government, particularly if the AfD comes in third. One would be trying to revive the \u201cgrand coalition\u201d of the past four years with the Social Democrats, many of whom think they would be better off with a time in opposition.\nHer preference would appear to be a coalition with the Free Democrats \u2014 who are poised to re-enter Parliament after failing to secure enough support in 2013 \u2014 and, if they fail to win enough seats to secure a majority together, the Greens.\nBut that would lead to extremely complicated coalition negotiations, which could take weeks, if not months, to resolve.\nIf AfD were to become the leader of the opposition, that would grant it the right to respond to the chancellor after she addresses Parliament and would give the far-right party more exposure.\nConcern is already building about how the far right\u2019s greater prominence would affect the largely respectful demeanor of debate that has been a cornerstone of German politics for decades.\nThe president of the Parliament, Norbert Lammert, who has announced his retirement after 12 years in that position, earned resounding applause this month when he urged lawmakers to uphold the \u201cconsensus of democrats over the competition between parties that fanatics and fundamentalists consider to be more important.\u201d\nRecent weeks have been marked by an increasingly aggressive tone in the AfD\u2019s campaign strategy, notably in an online ad accusing Ms. Merkel of breaking her oath of office by admitting so many refugees, and in protests by demonstrators who have disrupted the chancellor\u2019s rallies by blowing whistles and shouting, \u201cGet lost!\u201d\nAlexander Gauland and Alice Weidel, the AfD\u2019s co-leaders, held two separate news conferences in the final weeks of campaigning, highlighting different elements of the party\u2019s stance on immigration in an apparent effort to remind voters of the issue.\nMr. Gauland, one of the founders of the party four years ago, has also taken on a more extreme, nationalist tone. He stood by his call last month for Ms. Merkel\u2019s integration minister to be \u201cdisposed of\u201d in Anatolia, the home of her grandparents, even when the chancellor pointedly called the remarks racist.\nHe has also taken on the country\u2019s postwar culture of atonement and remembrance of that period, calling for Germans to \u201ctake pride in the performance of German soldiers in two world wars.\u201d\nSuch extreme statements seem to be mobilizing party loyalists, said Bernhard P\u00f6rksen, a media professor at the University of T\u00fcbingen.\n\u201cThe success of the AfD is in its strategy of choosing aggressive polarization,\u201d he said, \u201cwhile the other parties are more careful, more weighed; and they are notable to make the differences between them clear.\u201d\nWhile the party seems to have energized its adherents, its critics have also been galvanized. Some Germans look on the prospect of AfD in Parliament with trepidation.\n\u201cI think about it a lot and it scares me,\u201d said Markus Pesch, 41, who studies ecotourism in Berlin. \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll get more than 10 percent, and will probably beat out the Greens and the Left,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m worried that they get to help make political decisions and that they\u2019ll have a real influence.\u201d\nOthers are more sanguine. \u201cI\u2019m not really worried about the rise of the AfD. Not everyone who is voting for them are actually right wing,\u201d said Christian Sekula, 54, a goods trader from Berlin. \u201cThey\u2019re just not happy, and they haven\u2019t found what they are looking for with the current parties.\u201d", "date": "Sept. 21, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/21/world/europe/far-right-german-party-poised-to-break-postwar-taboo.html", "tags": "postwar parties break poised german party afd \u201d parliament far-right \u2014 taboo"}
