{"title": "Jorah Mormont, King Of The Friend Zone, Doesn't Know What The 'Friend Zone' Is", "content": "On \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d Jorah Mormont isn\u2019t just in the friend zone, he is the friend zone. He\u2019s king on the friend-zone throne. And with the memes upon memes dedicated to Jorah\u2019s lack of romance with Dany, there are no usurpers.\u00a0\nFor example ...\nBut with\u00a0\u201cJack Taylor,\u201d a series based on the Ken Bruen novels, that\u2019s the last thing on actor Iain Glen\u2019s mind. Glen plays the titular Taylor on the show, which is now streaming its latest installments on Acorn. He\u2019s an Irish ex-cop-turned-private-eye who drinks a bit too hard, deals with psychopathic killers and, with his on-and-off romance, has no time for friend-zone frustrations.\u00a0\nWith such a contrast between the characters \u2014 Mormont doing anything for Dany and Taylor doing pretty much whatever he wants \u2014 The Huffington Post asked Glen what it\u2019s like to portray someone who\u2019s not concerned with playing the Game of Zones: Friend Zones.\nThat\u2019s when we came to a startling revelation: Despite all those Jorah Mormont memes, Glen doesn\u2019t know what we\u2019re talking about.\n\u201cI\u2019m not entirely sure that I know what the friend zone is,\u201d said Glen, \u201cI hold my hand up. I\u2019m social media illiterate. I\u2019ve never tweeted and don\u2019t have Facebook.\u201d\nWhat? Jorah kidding us, right?\n\u201cIf I\u2019m talking about the right thing here,\u201d he added, \u201cI\u2019m a bit like Jack Taylor to be honest [with] that sort of stuff, which he\u2019s very suspicious of.\u201d\nThe actor continued chatting with HuffPost about \u201cJack Taylor,\u201d \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and, yes,\u00a0friend zones.\u00a0\nYou\u2019re Jack Taylor. In pop culture, there\u2019s also Jack Reacher and Jack Ryan. Why are guys named Jack always badasses?\nI don\u2019t know,\u00a0but it\u2019s a cool name. Every single syllable blunt, to the point, go for the jugular. I have no idea. I always quite fancied playing a private eye since when I started acting, and I think that was because I saw Jack Nicholson in \u201cChinatown,\u201d which I adored, and maybe it\u2019s a hangover from that. I think all actors secretly want to play a private eye.\nAnd Jack Nicholson is also named Jack. So it all makes sense.\nExactly!\u00a0\nYou\u2019ve done nine Jack Taylor projects now. What are you proudest of?\nJack Taylor requires more of me, and I\u2019ve enjoyed that very much so, developing scripts, working with the writer and working with\u00a0the director. In terms of the product, I hope and feel that it\u2019s more characterful than a lot of the crime milieu.\u00a0It has more personality for me. Crime should exclude nothing. That\u2019s what I love.\u00a0\nHow did you prepare to speak in an Irish accent?\nI\u2019ve always enjoyed playing a dialect. It\u2019s like wearing a different pair of clothes if it works. It\u2019s a releasing thing instead of a restricting thing, and I don\u2019t know why, but Ireland has always been very kind to me. I\u2019ve done about two or three TV things there, and I\u2019ve done three or four features there. Either people have been forgiving or accepting of me playing Irish.\nThe people of Galway are very sweet and very forgiving.\u00a0If I\u2019m not doing it right, they make me believe I am. They\u2019re always calling out to me while we\u2019re filming and saying, \u201cHey, Jack. It\u2019s great! Did you catch him yet?\u201d\nSo, you really don\u2019t know what the friend zone is or look at the memes online?\nI honestly don\u2019t. I\u2019m honest when I say so. So, tell me, what is \u201cJorah in the Friend Zone,\u201d so I can just make sense of what that is.\nWell ...\u00a0(At this point,\u00a0I wanted to tell him the horrors of the friend zone: how it\u2019s as cold as the land beyond the wall of Westeros. No sunlight shines there, there is no happiness, and there is no escape.\u00a0But I couldn\u2019t do that to Ser Jorah.) ... It\u2019s like this area when you\u2019re with a girl where you don\u2019t move the relationship forward, and then you\u2019re just stuck as her friend.\nThat\u2019s right, yes. [Laugh]\n(Oh, sweet summer child ... )\u00a0\nWith Jorah, people love how he\u2019s so enamored with Dany despite zero chance of any romance.\nWell, I think that\u2019s true, but I think it has evolved. [We\u2019re]\u00a0sort of 80 hours into the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d story [and]\u00a0during the course of the journey, many things have happened. There was a complexity to Jorah\u2019s first approach to Daenerys. He was actually seeking his own redemption from the exile that had been put upon him, but very soon into meeting her, he fell very much in love with her, not just fell in love but also hugely admired her and had a profound conviction that she would make a great and benign leader, so it was a complex mixture.\nI do think, over the course of many happenings, he came to realize that love, and certainly a sexual love, was not going to be reciprocated, but he\u2019s in love with her. That doesn\u2019t kill it. In a way, it sort of makes it grow.\u00a0Life has taught me that, anyway. It certainly hasn\u2019t stopped his admiration or belief in her. It has evolved over the course of time.\nI\u2019m trying to remember where we are, what\u2019s been seen and what hasn\u2019t been seen, but I think a point comes where he just wants her forgiveness for what she believes is the wrong that he has done. And that takes precedent over any belief that she\u2019s gonna return or want him to be her lover. Anyway, I\u2019m babbling, but that\u2019s the territory of it, and I supposed if people like that \u2014 people like things unfulfilled, and things held in suspense \u2014 I think is partly why people are drawn to it, and I\u2019m glad people like the thrust of those storylines.\nLadies and gentlemen, may I present Jorah Mormont, King of the Friend Zone. Long may he reign.", "date": "\n03/28/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/iain-glen-jorah-mormont-friend-zone_n_58d294dfe4b0f838c62e73bb", "tags": "think know mormont jack king \u201d taylor love friend jorah zone like"}
