{"title": "GOP Lawmaker Asks Why Men Pay For Maternity Care- Woman\u2019s Reply Is Gold-", "content": "A GOP congressman\u00a0asked why men should have to pay for maternity care, and this woman\u2019s response is now resonating across the country.\nBarbara Rank, 63, wrote to her local newspaper, the Dubuque Telegraph Herald, after Rep. Rod Blum (R-Iowa) made the comments at a town hall last Monday.\nBlum said he\u2019d voted in favor of legislation that repeals and replaces major parts of the Affordable Care Act\u00a0to \u201cget rid of some of these crazy regulations that Obamacare puts on [\u2026] such as a 62-year-old male having to have pregnancy insurance.\u201d\nWatch the clip below:\nHis remark did not sit well with Rank, however, who was in the audience.\nIn her letter to the newspaper, which was published Friday, Rank explained how the lawmaker\u2019s comment had caused her to rhetorically ask herself \u201cwhy should I pay for a bridge I don\u2019t cross, a sidewalk I don\u2019t walk on, a library book I don\u2019t read?\u201d\n\u201cWhy should I pay for a flower I won\u2019t smell, a park I don\u2019t visit, or art I can\u2019t appreciate?\u201d the retired special education teacher continued. \u201cWhy should I pay the salaries of politicians I didn\u2019t vote for, a tax cut that doesn\u2019t affect me, or a loophole I can\u2019t take advantage of?\u201d\nRank ended her missive\u00a0explaining why she did actually believe in people paying for all of those things \u2015 by saying how it was all about \u201cdemocracy,\u201d \u201ca civil society\u201d and \u201cthe greater good.\u201d\nSomeone\u00a0posted a photograph of her letter to Reddit over the weekend, and it\u2019s now gone viral, sparking positive reactions across the internet:\nRank said she\u2019d laughed at the response to her letter because it\u2019s \u201csuch a silly little piece.\u201d The conclusion to the note, however, was something she \u201calways\u201d ends up saying, she added.\n\u201cEvery argument I\u2019ve ever had with somebody, friends or relative: Don\u2019t you want to live in a civil society?\u201d she told The Washington Post. \u201cGovernment is the structure of the country we live in. It\u2019s not as bad as people make it out to be.\u201d\nJohn Ferland, a representative for Blum, later claimed the congressman\u2019s comment (which can be heard in the clip above) had been \u201ctaken out of context.\u201d\n\u201cHe was referring to the idea of patients being able to choose health insurance policies that fit their needs, rather than one-size-fits-all policies filled with government mandates,\u201d Ferland told the Telegraph Herald. \u201cObviously, he understands that taxes pay for things that not everybody uses.\u201d\nRank, however, told The Des Moines Register that the popularity of her letter \u201cjust shows that a lot of people have the same feelings and thoughts that I did.\u201d", "date": "\n05/16/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/rod-blum-obamacare-newspaper-response-viral_n_591ad88de4b07d5f6ba5dee3", "tags": "letter congressman rank lawmaker gop woman maternity \u201d care- asks blum pay told reply men however gold-"}
