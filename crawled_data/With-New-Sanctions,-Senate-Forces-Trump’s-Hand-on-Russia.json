{"title": "With New Sanctions, Senate Forces Trump\u2019s Hand on Russia", "content": "The Senate on Thursday approved sweeping sanctions against Russia, forcing President Trump to decide whether to accept a tougher line against Moscow or issue a politically explosive veto amid investigations into ties between his presidential campaign and Russian officials.\nThe Senate vote, 98 to 2, followed the passage of a House bill this week to punish Russia, Iran and North Korea for various violations by each of the three American adversaries. In effect, the measure would sharply limit Mr. Trump\u2019s ability to suspend or lift sanctions on Russia \u2014 handcuffing a sitting president just six months into his term with the nearly unanimous support of a Republican-led Congress.\nThe Trump administration has opposed the sanctions against Russia, arguing that it needs flexibility to pursue a more collaborative diplomacy with a country that, by American intelligence consensus, interfered in last year\u2019s presidential election. But now the president faces a decision he had hoped to avoid, even though the administration supports sanctions against Iran and North Korea.\nWhite House aides have acknowledged privately that a veto would be politically awkward, at best, for Mr. Trump to justify during the continuing investigations into whether his campaign colluded with Russia.\nLast week, after House and Senate leaders announced an agreement on sanctions, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the incoming White House press secretary, suggested that Mr. Trump would sign the final package. Since then, though, the administration has hedged, saying that Mr. Trump will have to review whatever plan reaches his desk.\n\u201cThe administration supports sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea. We continue to support strong sanctions against those three countries,\u201d Ms. Sanders said on Thursday. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to wait and see what that final legislation looks like, and make a decision at that point.\u201d\nThe sanctions target suppliers of weapons to the Assad regime in Syria and those undermining cybersecurity, among others. The Senate last month passed a similar bill, 98 to 2, that punished only Russia and Iran.\nBut the effort had languished for weeks amid technical holdups in the House, compelling Democrats to accuse Republicans of stalling on the president\u2019s behalf. As the legislation sat, the administration lobbied against it, finding common cause with oil and gas companies, defense contractors and other financial players who argued that some of the sanctions provisions could harm their profits.\nThe House version included a handful of changes from the initial Senate bill, some made in response to concerns raised by American energy companies. Those tweaks, combined with the addition of sanctions against North Korea that were drafted by the House, helped end the impasse.\nOn Tuesday, the House approved the measure, 419 to 3.\nNow, as ever, attention turns to the president.\nSenator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he \u201ccannot imagine\u201d Mr. Trump rejecting legislation with such veto-proof majorities in Congress.\n\u201cIf I were giving advice to the president, which I\u2019m not on this issue,\u201d he began before offering some, \u201cit\u2019s just not a good way to start a presidency to veto something and then be soundly overridden.\u201d\nFor years, a hawkish approach to Russia has been central to Republican foreign policy doctrine. But conservative lawmakers have found themselves at odds with their own president amid Mr. Trump\u2019s stated desire to find common ground with Russia, against the background of Russia-tinged scandals that have consumed his administration.\nSenator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who has long advocated an aggressive stance toward Russia, cheered colleagues for summoning bipartisanship \u201cto respond to Russia\u2019s attack on American democracy.\u201d\n\u201cWe will not tolerate attacks on our democracy. That\u2019s what this bill is all about,\u201d Mr. McCain said. \u201cWe must take our own side in this fight, not as Republicans, not as Democrats, but as Americans.\u201d\nDemocrats took more explicit aim at Mr. Trump, suggesting that the legislation reflected a dim view of his credibility on Russia.\n\u201cThis bill will prevent President Trump from relaxing sanctions on Russia without congressional review,\u201d said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, who urged Mr. Trump to sign the legislation as quickly as possible. \u201cWe\u2019re all concerned about that.\u201d\nSenator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, called on Republican leaders in Congress to publicly commit to overriding any veto, in the hopes of deterring Mr. Trump before he tries. And Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, said that \u201cit won\u2019t matter what President Trump decides\u201d given Congress\u2019s overwhelming support for the sanctions.\nThe Kremlin\u2019s perspective on the matter is clear.\nSeveral days ago, as details of the final sanctions agreement came into focus, Dmitri S. Peskov, a spokesman for President Vladimir V. Putin, was asked by the government-run news agency RIA to characterize Moscow\u2019s view.\n\u201cHighly negative,\u201d he said.", "date": "July 27, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/us/politics/senate-russia-sanctions-trump.html", "tags": "forces sanctions hand administration \u201c president trump house senate russia new"}
