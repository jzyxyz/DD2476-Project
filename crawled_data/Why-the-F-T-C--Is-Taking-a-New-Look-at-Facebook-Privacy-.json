{"title": "Why the F.T.C. Is Taking a New Look at Facebook Privacy ", "content": "After a yearlong string of news reports that have called Facebook\u2019s data-sharing practices into question, federal regulators are taking a hard look at how the social media company handles the personal information of its users.\nIt is not the first time Facebook has drawn government scrutiny. About seven years ago, after charges were leveled by the Federal Trade Commission, the company made an agreement with the agency to overhaul its privacy practices. \nThat agreement, called a consent decree, provides a road map for how the F.T.C. is likely to scrutinize Facebook over the coming months.\nIn 2007, Facebook introduced Facebook Beacon, a program that broadcast details on users\u2019 online purchases to their friends, initially allowing users to opt out of sharing their purchases only on a case-by-case basis. \nFacebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, apologized with what an article in The New York Times described as a \u201csymphony of contrition.\u201d In a Facebook post that year, Mr. Zuckerberg wrote: \u201cI\u2019m not proud of the way we\u2019ve handled this situation and I know we can do better.\u201d\nAt the end of 2009, a coalition of nonprofit consumer and privacy groups, led by the Electronic Privacy Information Center, petitioned the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Facebook\u2019s handling of user data. \nThe groups filed a complaint saying that Facebook had repeatedly disregarded users\u2019 expectations and diminished their privacy. The complaint argued that the company had violated a federal law prohibiting unfair and deceptive business practices. \nIn 2011, the F.T.C. filed charges against Facebook that said the company had deceived consumers about their privacy.\nThe F.T.C.\u2019s complaint charged Facebook with a number of deceptive privacy practices. Among them:\n\u25a0 Facebook shared users\u2019 personal details with advertisers even though the company had promised not to do so, the agency said.\n\u25a0 Facebook allowed third-party apps that users had installed to have access to nearly all of their personal data \u2014 even though Facebook had stated the apps could obtain only the personal information they needed to operate, the agency said.\n\u25a0 In 2009, the agency said, Facebook changed its information-handling practices, making certain personal details \u2014 like users\u2019 friends lists \u2014 public, overriding the choices of people who wanted to keep that data private. The policy change, the F.T.C.\u2019s complaint said, exposed users\u2019 profile information, including \u201cpotentially controversial political views or other sensitive information,\u201d to third parties.\n\u25a0 The agency said Facebook claimed it certified the security practices of apps participating in its \u201cVerified Apps program,\u201d but the company did not do so.\nIn November 2011, Facebook agreed to settle charges that it had deceived consumers by \u201ctelling them they could keep their information on Facebook private, and then repeatedly allowing it to be shared and made public,\u201d the F.T.C. said in a statement at the time.\nThe agreement, which became final in 2012, prohibited Facebook from misleading consumers about their data privacy and security. The social network committed to getting the explicit consent of users before making changes that overrode their privacy preferences.\nThe agency ordered Facebook to put a comprehensive privacy program in place to protect the privacy and confidentiality of users\u2019 information and to manage the risks of existing and new products. \nIt also required Facebook over the next 20 years to undergo biennial audits by an independent third party to certify that the privacy program was properly protecting the information of the company\u2019s users.\nIn March 2018, The New York Times reported that a voter-profiling company, Cambridge Analytica, had harvested the personal data of millions of Facebook users without their knowledge or permission. \nThe voter-profiling company obtained the data from a researcher who had offered a personality survey app on Facebook. Although only about 270,000 Facebook users agreed to share their data to participate in the survey, the Facebook platform enabled the app to improperly harvest the personal details of millions of those users\u2019 friends \u2014 consumers who had not agreed to share their information with the survey app, The Times reported.\nPrivacy experts, law professors and at least one former F.T.C. official have argued that Facebook\u2019s failure to prevent the survey app from obtaining the data of users\u2019 friends violated the federal consent agreement. So did Facebook\u2019s failure to prevent the app developer from sharing both users\u2019 data and the data of users\u2019 friends with Cambridge Analytica, these critics said.\nThey said the Cambridge Analytica episode suggested that Facebook had failed to adequately conduct the risk assessments the agreement required it to do. It also failed to obtain required, explicit consent from users\u2019 friends for the sharing of their data with third parties, the privacy experts said.\nThey also argued that Facebook had failed to operate a comprehensive privacy protection program and take reasonable precautions \u2014 steps the company was obligated to take under the consent decree.\n\u201cThe consent decree requires Facebook to always be vigilant to possible privacy problems and try to solve them,\u201d said David C. Vladeck, a professor at Georgetown Law and a former director of consumer protection at the F.T.C. who oversaw the investigation that led to the consent decree. \u201cCambridge Analytica made clear that Facebook was not auditing third-party apps.\u201d \nOn March 26, the F.T.C. said it was conducting an investigation into Facebook\u2019s privacy practices. An agency spokeswoman declined to comment last week on the progress of the investigation.  \nSince then, Facebook has made other admissions about privacy problems that experts said could potentially violate the consent agreement or trigger new federal charges of deceptive privacy practices.\n\u25a0 In June, the company said a software bug made public the posts of up to 14 million users who thought the posts were private. \n\u25a0 Also in June, The New York Times reported that Facebook had allowed device makers like Amazon, Apple, Blackberry, Microsoft and Samsung access to the data of users\u2019 friends without their explicit consent, even after the company said that it would no longer share such information with outsiders.\n\u25a0 In September, the company said a security breach had exposed the personal data of nearly 50 million users. \n\u25a0 In October, Facebook said Russian firms had scraped user data, including \u201cmatching photos from individuals\u2019 personal social media accounts in order to identify them.\u201d \n\u25a0 In December, Facebook said a software bug had given apps access to a larger set of users\u2019 photos than usual.\n\u25a0 Also in December, The New York Times reported that Facebook had shared user data with Amazon, Microsoft, Yahoo and other companies without users\u2019 knowledge or permission.\nIn addition to the F.T.C., Facebook is under investigation by the Justice Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Securities and Exchange Commission and several government agencies in Europe over Cambridge Analytica\u2019s harvesting of user data.\nFacebook said it had developed a privacy program as required by federal regulators and it had not violated the consent decree.\n\u201cWe are transparent with people about how we use their information and respect people's privacy settings,\u201d Sally Aldous, a Facebook spokeswoman, said in a statement. \u201cWe have a privacy program, which ensures we protect people's information, which we continuously evolve to address the privacy risks of our products and services.\u201d\nMs. Aldous said the company\u2019s privacy program involved more than three dozen control mechanisms \u2014 including a privacy governance team and security teams that \u201censure privacy risks for product launches and major changes are identified, discussed, and escalated for decisions when necessary.\u201d\nFacebook said it disagreed with The Times\u2019s characterization of its sharing of user data with Amazon, Apple, Blackberry, Microsoft, Samsung, Yahoo and other companies. \nThe social network said device makers used information from Facebook to integrate certain Facebook features on their platforms and agreed not to use that information for their own purposes. The company also said Spotify and other third-party apps had access to users\u2019 Facebook data only after users signed in with their Facebook account in the third-party apps.\n\u201cNone of these partnerships or features gave companies access to information without people\u2019s permission, nor did they violate our 2012 settlement with the F.TC.,\u201d Konstantinos Papamiltiadis, director of developer platforms and programs at Facebook, wrote in a company news release last week.", "date": "Dec. 22, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/22/technology/facebook-consent-decree-details.html", "tags": "users company taking information consent \u201d facebook look data new f.t.c privacy"}
