While wind and rain may be kept outside, so are light and air\". \nTrump 'would win' trade war with China\nTrump and trade: A radical agenda?\nChina goes big in Davos - and here's why\nMr Xi called for international co-operation to address issues like income disparity and inadequate global governance. \nHe also said that while some consider globalisation a sort of \"Pandora's box\" full of all the world's evils, it cannot be blamed for the plight of Syrian refugees or the 2008 financial crisis.\nHe told the forum that China's economy was expected to have grown 6.7% in 2016, despite the sluggish world economy.\nMinutes before Mr Xi's speech, one of Donald Trump's closest advisers told the BBC that the US would win any trade war with China.\nAnthony Scaramucci warned that if China chose to retaliate when the Trump administration imposed tariffs on imports, it would cost them \"way more\" than it would cost the US.\nHe added that the current trade deal was \"more favourable to China than us\".\nMr Scaramucci will enter the White House on 20 January as a senior adviser to the president.", "date": "17 January 2017", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-38650487", "tags": "tells winners forum world xi us china wars trump economic trade told"}
