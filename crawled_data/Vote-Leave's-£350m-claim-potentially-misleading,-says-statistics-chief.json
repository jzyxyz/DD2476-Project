Given the high level of public interest in this debate it is important that official statistics are used accurately, with important limitations or caveats clearly explained,\" he wrote.\nThe comments were seized on by the Britain Stronger in Europe campaign. Mr Lamb said it was \"a damning indictment of the Leave campaign\" and \"yet another example of their desperate attempts to mislead people in this referendum campaign\".\nBut Vote Leave stood by the figure, and said the campaign would be writing to Sir Andrew on the issue.\nA spokesman said: \"As the Office for National Statistics makes clear, the EU takes \u00a3350m from us every week. That is the total debit made from our national accounts.\n\"We get some money back but that is controlled by the EU - if we vote Leave we will take back control of all of this money. We will be able to spend our money on our priorities like the NHS.\"", "date": "21 April 2016", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36104163", "tags": "figure uk leave eu statistics claim chief campaign potentially says money misleading sir vote"}
