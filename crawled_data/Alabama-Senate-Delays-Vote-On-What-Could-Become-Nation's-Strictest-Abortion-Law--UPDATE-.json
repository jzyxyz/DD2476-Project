{"title": "Alabama Senate Delays Vote On What Could Become Nation's Strictest Abortion Law -UPDATE-", "content": "Alabama state senators on Thursday postponed a vote on what could become the nation\u2019s strictest abortion ban when the chamber erupted into chaos over a procedural vote.\nSome Republicans hastily tried to remove exemptions for rape and incest from the bill without holding an official vote, according to local news reports.\nLawmakers then tabled the final vote until at least next Tuesday.\nThe bill, the\u00a0Human Life Protection Act, would make it a felony for a doctor to perform an abortion. The act would be punishable by at least 10 years in prison.\nThe state House passed the bill last week. The version passed in the House did not include exceptions for rape or incest, only permitting abortions if the pregnant woman\u2019s life would be in danger.\nThe Senate version of the bill included an amendment with exceptions for rape and incest. Republican legislators attempted to remove those exemptions at the last minute on Thursday, which led to the abrupt postponement of the vote.\nAccording to Senate Minority Leader Bobby Singleton (D), state Lt. Gov. Will Ainsworth (R), who presides over the chamber, tried to quickly table the amendment using a voice vote.\nSingleton had called for a full roll call vote on the amendment, so that it could be on the record. Singleton said that three members, which is required under the chamber\u2019s rules, had raised their hands to sustain a motion for a roll call vote. But Ainsworth had already begun the voice vote.\nAfter a shouting match among the lawmakers, Senate President Pro Tem Del Marsh (R) moved to table the vote until next Tuesday.\nSingleton said that Ainsworth \u201crefused to respect the Democratic side\u201d of the chamber, and accused him of \u201ca plot and a scheme to run over\u201d the legislative process.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to stand back and just be pushed around,\u201d Singleton told HuffPost.\nGov. Kay Ivey (R) has not made it clear whether she would sign the bill into law.", "date": "\n05/09/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/alabama-strict-abortion-law-felony_n_5cd44a1be4b054da4e857a4a", "tags": "-update- rape alabama singleton law chamber amendment become strictest senate abortion bill could state delays nation incest vote"}
