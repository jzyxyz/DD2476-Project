{"title": "Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Introduce Legislation To Cap Credit Card Rates", "content": "Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) are teaming up on new legislation to take down credit card interest rates.\nAt a live-streamed press conference Thursday, the two introduced what they\u2019re calling the \u201cLoan Shark Prevention Act.\u201d If passed, the law would cap interest rates on credit cards and consumer loans at 15 percent, dealing a massive blow to the payday loan industry and other predatory lenders.\nWhile some states like New York have outlawed payday lending, high-interest credit cards have moved to fill the gap \u2015 and proved just as harmful to those trying to climb out of poverty. So instead of saving money and building wealth, the poor are stuck paying interest on loans they had to take out to cover things like unexpected medical bills.\n\u201cWhen banks charge higher and higher interest rates,\u201d said Rep. Ocasio-Cortez, \u201cessentially your credit card becomes a payday loan.\u201d\nAccording to data tracked by CreditCards.com, 39 million Americans have carried credit card debt for at least the past two years and another 8 million can\u2019t recall how long they\u2019ve been in debt. Together, that\u2019s 44 percent of all cardholders. At the same time, credit card interest rates are higher than they\u2019ve ever been.\nThe representatives repeatedly compared their legislation to usury laws, which, prior to 1978, empowered states to limit the amount of interest that could be charged on loans.\nA Supreme Court ruling that year in Marquette National Bank v. First of Omaha Service Corp held that national banks could export the interest rate of wherever they were headquartered, prompting states like South Dakota and Delaware to drop their usury laws in a successful bid to attract banks to their state.\n\u201cHalf the U.S. had usury laws until the 1970s when they were repealed,\u201d Sanders said Thursday. \u201cSince then, big banks have had a blank check to charge extortion-level interest rates to the poor.\u201d\n\u201cUltimately, what this comes down to is the issue of greed, which is permeating every aspect of our society,\u201d he added, continuing:\n\u201cIt is Wall Street; it is the drug companies; it is the insurance companies that pay their CEOs outrageous compensation packages while you can\u2019t afford health insurance; it is the fossil fuel industry making billions of dollars as they destroy the planet. On and on it goes.\u201d\u00a0", "date": "\n05/09/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bernie-alexandria-cap-interest-rates_n_5cd463afe4b0796a95d859fe", "tags": "card credit introduce banks alexandria rates loans payday states \u201d ocasio-cortez bernie interest cap legislation sanders"}
