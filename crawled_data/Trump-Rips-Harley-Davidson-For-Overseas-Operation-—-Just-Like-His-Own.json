{"title": "Trump Rips Harley-Davidson For Overseas Operation \u2014 Just Like His Own", "content": "Donald Trump is continuing to hammer Harley-Davidson over the motorcycle company\u2019s plans to relocate some production overseas to dodge European tariffs triggered by the president\u2019s trade war. What Trump isn\u2019t mentioning is that the president and his family own businesses abroad and that most Trump products are produced in foreign factories.\nDuring a GOP primary debate before the presidential election, Trump was challenged on outsourcing products overseas. He defended the practice then, arguing:\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re allowed to do it\u201d \u2014 as is Harley-Davidson. \u201cSo I will take advantage of it,\u201d he added. In a unit of \u201cstudy\u201d in the now-defunct Trump University, Trump wrote that outsourcing jobs is sometimes a \u201cnecessary step.\u201d (Trump agreed to pay $25 million to settle fraud claims against his \u201cuniversity.\u201d)\u00a0\nBut the president again slammed the Wisconsin motorcycle company on a Fox News program Sunday, saying the company will take a \u201cbig hit\u201d from consumers angry that an American company is moving some of its production abroad.\u00a0\n\u201cEverybody who ever bought a Harley-Davidson voted for Trump ... and they are very unhappy about it,\u201d\u00a0Trump said. He added that the company \u201cshouldn\u2019t play cute.\u201d He accused Harley-Davidson on Twitter earlier in the week: \u201cThey surrendered,\u00a0they quit! The aura will be gone.\u201d\nAn ad by Hillary Clinton during the presidential campaign attacked Trump for outsourcing manufacturing to 12 different countries. An investigation by The Washington Post confirmed that. Import records revealed that Trump shirts, suits, sports coats, eyeglasses, home goods\u00a0\u2014 such as furniture, lighting fixtures and mirrors\u00a0\u2014 and hotel amenities including shampoo, towels and laundry bags were all made abroad. Factories used are located in China, Germany, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Vietnam and South Korea, among others.\nWhen Trump hosted his \u201cMade in America\u201d\u00a0week at the White House last year, he was slammed for hypocrisy. \u201cInstead of lecturing us, Trump should try setting an example,\u201d said a statement from the Democratic National Committee.\nWhite House senior adviser and Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump has not manufactured a single product for her business operations in the U.S.\u00a0She relies exclusively on low-wage workers in foreign factories in countries including Bangladesh, Indonesia and China, according to another investigation by The Washington Post.\nEarlier this year, Trump slammed Amazon for failing to pay state sales taxes on its goods. While Amazon was collecting sales taxes for sales to 45 states at the time, the\u00a0TrumpStore.com\u00a0website was collecting sales tax only on orders shipped to buyers in Florida and Louisiana.\nAfter White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was ordered out of a Virginia restaurant last month, Trump tweeted that the restaurant was \u201cfilthy.\u201d The restaurant had no violations in its last health inspection, which was not the case with Trump-owned restaurants.", "date": "\n07/01/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-rips-harley-davidson-over-overseas-operation-like-trump-has_n_5b396a24e4b007aa2f810ed1", "tags": "company like overseas \u201c rips sales outsourcing trump operation factories harley-davidson \u2014 abroad"}
