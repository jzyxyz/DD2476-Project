{"title": "Running on Book Sense and Charm", "content": "TORONTO\nIN the last few years, Michael Ignatieff\u2019s friends in the United States and England began receiving self-deprecating e-mail messages from him lamenting how dull and low-profile his life had suddenly become.\nHe had spent most of the preceding four decades making a name for himself in both countries \u2014 writing essays on the world\u2019s war zones for The New Yorker, The New Republic and The New York Review of Books; writing novels and screenplays; enjoying popularity as a television-show host in Britain and a regular at the Groucho Club; and teaching at Harvard and Cambridge universities.\nNow, he joked, he was stuck in the pedestrian life of a freshman civil servant \u2014 in Canada no less.\nMr. Ignatieff shocked friends and colleagues three years ago by chucking the life of the mind for the hurly-burly of politics and returning, after a long exile, to his native country to win a seat in Parliament. And if he was bored, it wasn\u2019t for long. Last December, after a tumultuous fortnight of machinations in parliament, Mr. Ignatieff, 61, became the leader of the opposition Liberal Party, which has been called Canada\u2019s \u201cnatural ruling party\u201d and has been in power for much of the last century.\nShould his party win control of the government, something it came close to doing last week and still hopes to in the coming months, he would become the next prime minister of Canada.\nAmong the circles in which Mr. Ignatieff once traveled, there might be a sense that anybody capable of writing a novel (\u201cScar Tissue\u201d) that becomes short-listed for the Booker Prize \u2014 anybody, for that matter, who had the writer Martin Amis and Michael Palin of Monty Python as guests at his wedding \u2014 could figure out a way to jump the queue of Canadian politics.\nEven so, his ascendancy puts his country on the cusp of an unusual moment, in some ways a throwback to the era of the dashing Pierre Trudeau, another smart-set intellectual who served as prime minister.\n\u201cHe was brought in to reinvigorate the liberal brand, to go for the big game right away,\u201d said Nelson Wiseman, a political scientist at the University of Toronto. \u201cI think a lot of the party thought, \u2018We need someone who has the intellectual gravitas of Pierre Trudeau.\u2019 Like Trudeau, he came in as a fresh figure, but he also had a reputation abroad that Trudeau didn\u2019t.\u201d\nMr. Ignatieff has proven savvy enough in his own country. Although his opposition coalition split apart and backed down last week from its efforts to defeat the Conservative government led by Prime Minister Stephen Harper, political watchers say that Mr. Ignatieff is probably just biding his time.\n\u201cHe wants the crown in his own right \u2014 not through a coalition but via an election, which most of the pundits think we\u2019ll have later this year,\u201d Mr. Wiseman said. \u201cHe also wants the Harper administration to have to wear the recession for a while.\u201d\nMr. Ignatieff\u2019s rise in Parliament happened fast, he said in an interview in late January. He said that he gave up a lot by leaving behind the private contentment of a serious writer\u2019s life to run for office.\n\u201cBut I\u2019m in here to be serious,\u201d he said, and added: \u201cThis is the only place where I can be a participant, not a spectator. I\u2019ve been a spectator, and now I\u2019m in the boat fishing. That part of it, from a spiritual point of view, it feels good.\u201d\nA FEW years ago, a survey conducted by Foreign Policy magazine and Prospect, a British journal, ranked Mr. Ignatieff as the 37th-most influential \u201cpublic intellectual\u201d in the world (the Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe was 38th). Although the clauses \u201cfor a Canadian\u201d or, now, \u201cfor a politician\u201d are often attached, people almost always describe Mr. Ignatieff as glamorous. Maclean\u2019s magazine once named him Canada\u2019s \u201cSexiest Cerebral Man.\u201d He was famous in London during the 1980s and 1990s when he was the host of a television talk show devoted to books and ideas. He was a sort of Anglophone version of Bernard-Henri L\u00e9vy, but with a pedigree and without the money or aversion to shirt-buttoning.\nMr. Ignatieff\u2019s big-time ambition is so much a part of his public identity that he often scores points by making fun of it himself. At a recent address to a group of 700 business leaders, he opened with a shout-out to a member of the audience who, he kindly noted, had run against him for his parliamentary seat. \u201cAnd I beat him,\u201d Mr. Ignatieff said, after a nicely timed comedic pause. The crowd laughed heartily.\nMr. Ignatieff\u2019s life story is positively novelistic in its detail. His father, George Ignatieff, was a Canadian diplomat, and his grandfather and great-grandfather were both Russian counts who served as cabinet ministers in the czarist government. His mother\u2019s brother, George Grant, was a famous political philosopher.\nMr. Ignatieff held the captainship of his boarding-school soccer team, produced a Harvard dissertation that involved spending nights watching over state prison inmates in Massachusetts and has written more than a dozen books: political tracts, three novels, a family history, a biography of his former mentor Isaiah Berlin, and \u2014 mobilized by what he saw in the Balkans \u2014 several books about human rights and intervention.\nIn 2004, when he was serving as the director of Harvard\u2019s Carr Center for Human Rights Policy, Mr. Ignatieff was visited by three strategists from Canada\u2019s Liberal wing who were leading an effort to infuse a party weakened by scandal with new blood. \u201cIt was a bolt from the blue,\u201d he recalled, when during dinner they asked him to consider coming back to run for office.\n\u201cThe chance to be in the arena was pretty irresistible,\u201d he said.\nIt was simultaneously of a piece with his background and somewhat incongruous. \u201cMy dad worked for four prime ministers,\u201d he said. \u201cI grew up in a house where public service was something you ought to do. But elected public service my father thought of with horror, because he knew how brutal it was.\u201d\nIn seeking his party\u2019s leadership position in 2006 and 2008, Mr. Ignatieff ran both times against Bob Rae, a longtime politician who happened to be one of his best friends; they had been roommates at the University of Toronto.\n\u201cIt was difficult running against Bob \u2014 we are old, old friends, and our dads were in the foreign service together, \u201d Mr. Ignatieff said.\u201d\nIn 2006, neither was elected leader, but in 2008, Mr. Rae bowed out of the contest at the last minute to throw his support to Mr. Ignatieff.\n\u201cWe had some very emotional conversations,\u201d Mr. Rae said in an interview in Toronto. \u201cMy feeling was that Michael had the support of the small and influential group of party officials who were voting \u2014 these were special, last-minute circumstances \u2014 but that if it had been a broader election throughout the party, I\u2019d have won.\u201d\nTo this, Mr. Ignatieff said, \u201cWe\u2019ll never know, because Bob pulled out of the race, because he made a very fine gesture.\u201d\nMr. Ignatieff\u2019s friend Leon Wieseltier, the literary editor of The New Republic, described him as \u201ca genuinely introspective individual,\u201d but said that in the more than two decades he has been editing him, he had never heard mention of an interest in running for office. \u201cHe is, in spirit, a humanist, not a politician,\u201d he said.\nMr. Wieseltier added: \u201cWhen I would see Michael, he and I would stroll arm in arm around Covent Garden singing \u2014 poorly, of course \u2014 some of the great quintet in the first act of \u2018Cos\u00ec Fan Tutte.\u2019 There was in him a hunger for intellectual authority and for a certain degree of social recognition, but it was never about power.\"\nWhile Mr. Ignatieff is blessed with many attributes that an elected official is supposed to possess \u2014 poise, focus and an instinct for self-preservation \u2014 he has a number of other traits that probably wouldn\u2019t play on an American stage.\nHe has openly acknowledged, without much self-censorship, regret over his initial support of the Iraq war and has movingly \u2014 if painfully \u2014 wrung his hands in print, most notably in The New York Times Magazine, over both the decision and his ensuing volte-face.\nIn Canada, he has faced criticism for his stance on the war, not simply because of all the agonizing, but because, as Andrew Potter wrote in a 2006 issue of Maclean\u2019s, \u201chis arguments reek of the necessary compromises you need to make as a liberal in the U.S.\u201d\nIn fact, over the years, Mr. Ignatieff has been very plain about his affinity for a country not his own. In 2002, writing in Granta, a literary magazine, he discussed his youthful opposition to the Vietnam War: \u201cI loved my own country, but I believed in America in a way that Canada never allowed. I was against the war because I thought it betrayed something essential about the country. I marched because I believed in Jefferson and Lincoln.\u201d\nConsidering those words now over tea and biscuits in Toronto, Mr. Ignatieff said, \u201cThere are moments when I\u2019ve identified passionately with America, and there are moments of total recoil.\u201d (The invasion of Iraq, he said, came to encompass both feelings.)\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve always felt passionately and proudly Canadian, and the way I prove that is that I\u2019ve never sought another passport,\u201d he said, then smiled as he added that he keeps a statue of Thomas Jefferson in his study.\nCharges of carpetbagging \u2014 Mr. Ignatieff and his second wife, Zsuzsanna Zshoar, moved into a condominium in an area of Toronto that he doesn\u2019t represent \u2014 and impatience to rise to the top have also provided red meat to conservatives and Canadian tabloids.\nDavid Rieff, an American friend and author, said: \u201cCanada, like a lot of culturally small countries, has an ambivalent relationship with countrymen who leave and make it big in the United States or in Europe. He\u2019s considered a celebrity at home, and they\u2019re very proud of him, but there\u2019s also some graceless carping. It\u2019s tall-poppy syndrome.\u201d\nMR. IGNATIEFF\u2019S next book, \u201cTrue Patriot Love: Four Generations in Search of Canada,\u201d will be published in late April, on the eve of a possible federal election. He described it as an exploration of Canadian identity \u2014 his, as well as those of his grandfather, father and children (he has two).\n\u201cEvery generation, they are all obsessed with the idea of how to maintain a Canadian empire in the face of America, this behemoth right next door.\u201d", "date": "JAN. 30, 2009", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/01/fashion/01ignatieff.html", "tags": "sense book party toronto charm \u201d canada ignatieff \u2014 running canadian"}
