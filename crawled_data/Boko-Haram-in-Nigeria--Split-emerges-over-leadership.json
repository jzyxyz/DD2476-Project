{"title": "Boko Haram in Nigeria: Split emerges over leadership", "content": "This story was last updated on 5 August 2016.\nThe disputed leader of Boko Haram has said he is still in charge of Nigeria's militant Islamist group despite a statement by so-called Islamic State that he had been replaced.\nAbubakar Shekau denounced the IS declaration that Abu Musab al-Barnawi was now leader.\nShekau accused al-Barnawi of trying to stage a coup against him.\nBoko Haram is fighting to overthrow Nigeria's government and establish an Islamic State in the north.\nIn the last 18 months it has lost most of the territory it had controlled after being pushed back by an offensive by the forces of Nigeria and its neighbours.\nBoko Haram aligned itself with IS in March 2015.\nShekau was last heard from in an audio message last August, saying he was alive and had not been replaced - an IS video released in April said the same.\nIn a 10-minute audio message in both Arabic and Hausa, Shekau appeared to distance Boko Haram from IS, but still called its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi \"caliph\".\nHe said that some in Boko Haram had stopped him communicating with al-Baghdadi.\n\"I was asked to send my ideology in writing to the caliph but it was manipulated by some people in order to achieve their own selfish interests,\" he added, describing a coup attempt against him.\nHe said he had sent eight different letters to IS leaders but they did not act on them, only to hear the news that he had been replaced. \nHe then described al-Barnawi and his followers as polytheist.\nBoko Haram has split before but this is the most serious division to date.\nAbubakar Shekau's outburst clearly shows that there are deep disagreements, which could translate into clashes between the foot soldiers loyal to the two leaders.\nIt is also a sign of the weakness of the group, possibly foreshadowing an eventual collapse.\nMilitary officials say the split is an indication that the group is breathing its last.\nBut some security analysts caution that the internal wrangling could make it more deadly and unpredictable.\nNigeria and the other regional forces will now need to turn this factionalism to their advantage.\nShekau had been accused of hoarding food and ammunition and also of driving away IS military advisers.\nBBC's Abuja bureau editor Naziru Mikailu says this split is likely to have a major impact on the way the group operates and could be a turning point in the fight against the insurgents. \nShekau took over as the group's leader after its founder, Muhammad Yusuf, died in Nigerian police custody in July 2009.\nUnder his leadership Boko Haram became more radical, carried out more killings and swore allegiance to IS in March 2015.\nIn numerous videos, Shekau taunted the Nigerian authorities, celebrating the group's violent acts, including the abduction of the more than 200 Chibok schoolgirls in April 2014.\nNigeria's army has claimed to have killed him on several occasions, and he has not appeared in a video since Boko Haram aligned itself with IS.", "date": "16 July 2018", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-36973354", "tags": "haram al-barnawi emerges replaced leadership nigeria leader last boko group split shekau"}
