{"title": "Susan Bro Wants To Shift The Focus From Heather Heyer\u2019s Death To Racial Injustice", "content": "CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. \u2015 As Susan Bro drove to the University of Virginia campus on Saturday, she let out a nervous sigh as she looked in the rearview mirror.\n\u201cThere\u2019s an ambulance,\u201d she said. \u201cI wonder where it\u2019s going. Probably where we\u2019re going.\u201d\nShe\u2019d been nervous all morning as cars and emergency vehicles sped past her. This weekend marks the anniversary of both the Unite the Right rally in which violent white supremacists marched through town and the murder of her daughter, Heather Heyer, at the hands of a neo-Nazi. When she sees an emergency vehicle, she wonders whether something has already happened this weekend \u2015 had there already been an incident downtown where the Nazi rally took place? Or on campus, where on Aug. 11 last year, a torch-wielding group of white supremacists marched and then attacked student protesters?\nThe ambulance behind her turned off the main road, and she sighed again.\n\u201cI have to remember things happen the way they\u2019re supposed to happen, and just let them happen,\u201d she said.\nBro was on her way to an event on campus called \u201cThe Hope That Summons Us: A Morning Of Reflection And Renewal.\u201d She sat in the front row at Old Cabell Hall, where members of the community and the university\u2019s new president, James Ryan, stood on stage to honor her daughter and apologize for what happened. Speakers sometimes focused their attention directly on her. Everyone here knows who Susan Bro is.\nThis is her life now. She\u2019s essentially a public figure, thrust into a career of activism locally and in media appearances across the world. As the founder of the Heather Heyer Foundation \u2015 a scholarship program for those seeking an education in social justice and paralegal work as her daughter did \u2015 she\u2019s made the aftermath of Unite the Right her full-time job.\nIt goes without saying that this is not the position she asked for. But she recognizes that her platform is an opportunity.\n\u201cI got thrown into the deep end. But it was a choice I made,\u201d Bro said. \u201cI thought, wouldn\u2019t it be a waste of Heather\u2019s sacrifice if I didn\u2019t call for action? But not vengeance and not forgiveness either ... I\u2019m calling for action, and I\u2019m waiting for accountability. But I\u2019ll let the courts decide that.\u201d\nOver the whirlwind of the past year, Bro has seen how her daughter\u2019s image has served as a beacon for social justice and activism against the white supremacists who still invade her town, her country and her government. Heather\u2019s face and name have been used by activists all over the world in protest of fascism and violence; we\u2019ve seen her featured on activist imagery\u00a0as far as Greece. Locally, a sign declaring \u201cAvenge Heather Heyer\u201d hung over the highway in Richmond\u00a0on Friday.\nTo Bro, the use of her daughter\u2019s legacy is beginning to miss the mark. She\u2019s proud of Heather and always knew her daughter would be a \u201cfocal point for change\u201d \u2015 she said so the last time HuffPost interviewed her, a day after Heather\u2019s death last year. But as Heather\u2019s image has evolved, so has her mother\u2019s mission: She wants to turn that energy and attention away from her family and toward solving the crisis of extremism that\u2019s gone mainstream.\n\u201cIt took me a while to get it. I kept saying that I don\u2019t get it. But a couple weeks ago, I had the a-ha moment,\u201d she said. \u201cI asked, what if it had been a person of color who died? It probably would have made the news briefly, and then we\u2019d have forgotten it like so many other deaths like we so conveniently forget. But it was a white woman, and people said, \u2018Oh my God, it was a white woman, we must have a problem.\u2019 We always had a problem. There\u2019s a great divide.\u201d\nShe wants Heather\u2019s name to inspire activism, but she said her daughter wouldn\u2019t like that her visage is the symbol that represents extremist violence and the fight against it. She recognizes that this city has grappled with white supremacy since its founding. She references the slavery that built Charlottesville; the echoes of the Jim Crow era; the Confederate monuments that the Unite the Right march was ostensibly slated to defend; issues of racial disparity and injustice; the rallies in town that still feature the Ku Klux Klan, Nazis and what she calls the \u201calt-not-right.\u201d\nActivists who have been fighting this for decades, especially those of color, should be the faces of this movement, she said.\n\u201cI want Heather to be remembered as someone who was there on that one day, a quiet individual who stood up to support this community,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I want \u2015 and she would want \u2015 her role downplayed so we can focus on the issues, which were going on well before her. Aug. 12 was a mainstream explosion brought by the other side, but this community has faced these issues forever.\u201d\nThat said, there are still questions left unanswered. For one, Bro seeks more information from local police and their new chief, RaShall Brackney; she says she still hasn\u2019t seen investigation documents pertaining to her daughter\u2019s death, and she wants an explanation for the\u00a0stagnant government response on Aug. 12 that allowed Nazis to brawl with counterprotesters for hours.\n\u201cHonest to God, looking from the outside in, standing by and watching people kill each other makes it look like the police are complicit \u2015 I just don\u2019t know their mindset,\u201d she said. \u201cThe new police chief introduced herself, and that\u2019s an answer I\u2019d like from her, as well as why I\u2019ve not read the police report.\u201d\nThis weekend, though, Bro just wants a peaceful conclusion. There\u2019s a tension in Charlottesville made palpable by the police and military units that dot every corner. Bro has a few interviews lined up, and on Sunday she\u2019ll march to lay flowers at the corner of the street now named after her daughter, Heather Heyer Way. When this dark anniversary passes, though, there\u2019s still work to be done.\n\u201cThe city\u2019s been going through a reckoning for a long time,\u201d she said. \u201cSome want to put our problems on outsiders; even I did at first. But no, this came from inside. I think a lot of people are just starting to wake up.\u201d", "date": "\n08/11/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/heather-heyer-mom-susan-bro-interview_n_5b6ef78ae4b0ae32af9882b8", "tags": "injustice racial death wants \u201d \u2015 focus susan white shift bro heather daughter still like heyer"}
