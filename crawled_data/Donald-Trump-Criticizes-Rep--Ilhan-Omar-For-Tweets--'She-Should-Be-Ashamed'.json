{"title": "Donald Trump Criticizes Rep- Ilhan Omar For Tweets- 'She Should Be Ashamed'", "content": "President Donald Trump weighed in Monday on a series of controversial tweets sent by Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), saying the freshman lawmaker should be \u201cashamed of herself\u201d for the comments some have called anti-Semitic.\n\u201cI think it was a terrible statement, and I don\u2019t think her apology was adequate,\u201d Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One while en route to El Paso, Texas, for a rally. When asked what Omar should have said instead, the president simply replied that \u201cshe knows what to say.\u201d\nOmar, who has been battling several accusations of anti-Semitism, found herself embroiled in controversy again this weekend. The lawmaker, who became one of the first Muslim women elected to Congress in November, wrote a tweet Sunday night in which she suggested American support for Israel was merely about money.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about the Benjamins baby,\u201d Omar wrote in reply to a tweet from journalist Glenn Greenwald, who was commenting on Republican support for pro-Israeli policies.\nCritics from both parties, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), said the statement played into negative stereotypes about Jewish people.\n\u201cAnti-Semitism must be called out, confronted and condemned whenever it is encountered, without exception,\u201d Pelosi and other House Democrats said in a statement. \u201cWe condemn these remarks and we call upon Congresswoman Omar to immediately apologize for these hurtful comments.\u201d\nOmar issued an apology on Monday, saying anti-Semitism was \u201creal\u201d and that she was \u201cgrateful for Jewish allies and colleagues who are educating me on the painful history of anti-Semitic tropes.\u201d\n\u201cWe have to always be willing to step back and think through criticism, just as I expect people to hear me when others attack me for my identity,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThis is why I unequivocally apologize.\u201d\nThe lawmaker also apologized last month for another tweet about Israel sent in 2012 in which she said the country had \u201chypnotized the world.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s response to Omar\u2019s apology comes as his own administration has faced many allegations of racism. Trump has regularly demeaned Mexicans, people from the Middle East and Native Americans, among others, but has rarely apologized.", "date": "\n02/11/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-ilhan-omar-anti-semitism_n_5c622340e4b09247fcc115e5", "tags": "think ashamed anti-semitism lawmaker omar \u201d trump said donald statement ilhan apology rep- criticizes tweets-"}
