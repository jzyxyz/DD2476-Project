{"title": "Even Before He Takes Office, Trump Knocks Automakers on Their Heels", "content": "DETROIT \u2014 Donald J. Trump has promised to change the way American automakers do business. Less than three weeks before his inauguration as president, he has already knocked the companies on their heels.\nIn a stunning reversal, Ford Motor, the nation\u2019s second-largest automaker, said on Tuesday that it would scrap plans to build a small-car assembly plant in Mexico that Mr. Trump has repeatedly criticized.\nJust a few hours earlier, Mr. Trump threatened to impose tariffs on cars made in Mexico by General Motors, the nation\u2019s largest automaker. His message forced the company to defend itself.\nBoth developments indicate how Mr. Trump is having an enormous impact on how American car companies run their operations, even before he takes office. They also illustrate that one of Mr. Trump\u2019s particular points of criticism, manufacturing in Mexico, has become particularly sensitive.\nBut the moves raise questions about how competitive the country\u2019s auto industry can be if its manufacturing options shrink in Mexico, and what the implications will be for consumers. For now, at least, some executives are praising Mr. Trump\u2019s economic plans.\n\u201cWe are encouraged by the pro-growth plans that President-elect Trump and the new Congress indicate they will pursue,\u201d Mark Fields, Ford\u2019s chief executive, said at an event on Tuesday.\nThe decision by Ford to drop plans for a new plant in Mexico \u2014 what would have been a $1.6 billion investment \u2014 came at the same time the company announced it would add 700 jobs to build electric and hybrid vehicles at a plant in Flat Rock, Mich.\nThe new Mexican factory was to build Ford Focus sedans currently manufactured at another Michigan plant near Detroit. Now the company will build those cars at an existing plant in Mexico.\nFord officials said that the revised plans were tied to market conditions that have depressed small-car sales, and that they did not consult with the incoming Trump administration before making the decision.\nThey did, though, tell Mr. Trump about the change just before the announcement. And on Tuesday, Mr. Fields made clear that Mr. Trump\u2019s policies were playing a role in the company\u2019s thinking. He added in an interview that the president-elect\u2019s emphasis on tax changes and cutting regulations should have an overall positive effect on automakers such as Ford.\n\u201cWe have a president-elect who has said very clearly that one of his first priorities is to grow the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cThat should be music to our ears.\u201d\nFord has been a target of Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism since last spring, when he singled the company out during his campaign for planning to create jobs in Mexico instead of pushing employment in the United States. After the election, Ford dropped plans to move production of a Lincoln S.U.V. to Mexico from Kentucky. That move followed discussions between Mr. Trump and William C. Ford Jr., the company\u2019s chairman.\nOne industry analyst, Ron Harbour of the consulting firm Oliver Wyman, said Ford was under intense pressure to alter its Mexican plans \u2014 or risk a constant drumbeat of criticism from Mr. Trump.\n\u201cIt was an embarrassment for them, and they said, \u2018Let\u2019s turn this thing around,\u2019\u201d Mr. Harbour said.\nNow Mr. Trump has turned his attention to G.M. In a Twitter post early Tuesday, he attacked the company for making a hatchback version of a Chevrolet in Mexico for sale in the American market.\n\u201cGeneral Motors is sending Mexican made model Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers tax-free across the border,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote. \u201cMake in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!\u201d\nA central tenet of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic platform has been to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, which allows for the free flow of manufactured goods between the United States, Canada and Mexico. Instead, he favors tariffs of up to 35 percent on products made in Mexico and sold in America.\nIndustry analysts have questioned whether automakers like G.M. and Ford can profitably build smaller vehicles in the United States instead of in Mexico, where wages rarely cross $10 an hour, compared with the $29 an hour earned by a majority of unionized American workers.\nFor consumers, those higher wages could add up to higher sticker prices. And that could potentially reduce sales.\nBut Mr. Trump is hardly backing off on his vow to scrap Nafta, and has found an unlikely ally in the powerful United Automobile Workers union, which represents hourly employees at G.M., Ford and Fiat Chrysler in the United States.\nWhile the U.A.W. leadership supported Mr. Trump\u2019s rival, Hillary Clinton, in the presidential election, the union has consistently attacked Nafta for encouraging car companies to invest in Mexico.\n\u201cThe U.A.W. has long believed that companies that sell in our country should build their products in our country,\u201d the union\u2019s president, Dennis Williams, said on Tuesday.\nThe hatchback made by G.M. in Mexico is a version of its Cruze compact car produced primarily at a factory in Lordstown, Ohio.\nSales of the Cruze, like many other passenger cars, have fallen in recent months because of low gas prices and shifting consumer demand toward more spacious sport utility vehicles. The Lordstown factory is among five American plants that G.M. will temporarily idle this month to reduce its growing inventories of slow-selling cars.\nG.M. officials declined to comment on Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter attack, other than to say in a statement that only a \u201csmall number\u201d of Cruze hatchbacks were built in Mexico for the American market.\nBut G.M. has a large exposure to any potential changes looming on Nafta, having committed up to $5 billion in long-term investment in Mexico. Foreign car companies like Volkswagen and Toyota are also adding jobs and new products at their Mexican facilities.\nWith Nafta under fire from the incoming administration, Ford, in particular, has tried to adapt.\nIn a recent interview, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, Robert L. Shanks, said the automaker was expecting changes in trade deals, and increasing its focus on expanding its manufacturing in the United States. \u201cThe bigger principle is we want to grow the U.S. economy,\u201d he said.\nOn Tuesday, the company packaged a series of announcements on new electrified vehicles with a promise to invest $700 million in its Flat Rock assembly plants.\nThe addition of 700 jobs at the plant will help it build a new fully electric S.U.V. to debut in 2020, as well as a new autonomous vehicle that has no steering wheel and operates entirely by computer.\nFord\u2019s vice president of global purchasing, Hau Thai-Tang, said the company chose the Flat Rock facility \u201cto really show we are making a commitment to the United States and to technology.\u201d\nMr. Fields, however, was more circumspect on why the company had dropped its plans for the new Mexican factory. \u201cWe didn\u2019t need it anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just don\u2019t need the capacity anymore given the demand for small cars.\u201d\nStill, the news about the Mexican plant and the new jobs in Michigan were conveyed directly to Mr. Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence before they were publicly announced.\n\u201cWe called the president-elect and the vice president-elect this morning and gave them the news,\u201d Mr. Fields said Tuesday. \u201cThey were very pleased, obviously, that we were making these investments in the U.S.\u201d", "date": "Jan. 3, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/03/business/ford-general-motors-trump.html", "tags": "automakers company office \u201c even new takes trump mexico knocks plans heels ford"}
