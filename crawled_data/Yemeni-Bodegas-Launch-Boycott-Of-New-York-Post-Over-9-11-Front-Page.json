{"title": "Yemeni Bodegas Launch Boycott Of New York Post Over 9-11 Front Page", "content": "The Yemeni American Merchants Association launched a boycott of The New York Post Saturday to protest the newspaper\u2019s incendiary front page that invoked 9/11 to attack Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.).\nMore than 1,000 bodegas and delis owned by Yemeni-Americans in New York represent an important portion of the Post\u2019s market. Bodega owners backed by\u00a0thousands of Yemeni-Americans and supporters\u00a0last flexed their political muscle two years ago when they closed up shop and hit the streets to protest President Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban\u00a0targeting several Muslim-majority nations. \u00a0\nThis time YAMA is taking action to protest the Post\u2019s front page Thursday that featured a photo of the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center with an isolated\u00a0 quote from a recent speech by Omar saying that \u201csome people did something\u201d while discussing the aftermath of 2001 terrorist attack on the U.S.\nThe implication was that Omar was dismissing the importance of 9/11. But the focus of her remarks was on the widespread discrimination that Muslims in America faced following the attack.\nA YAMA statement said the front page \u201cprovoked hatred,\u201d fueled \u201cthreats,\u201d and \u201caims to harm Omar,\u201d who has been the target of death threats since taking her seat in Congress early this year.\n\u201cThis rhetoric threatens the safety and wellbeing of Omar, Muslim leaders, and the larger Muslim American community at a time when Islamophobia is at an all-time high,\u201d the statement added.\u00a0\nThe group said it was calling on \u201call Yemeni American bodega and deli owners\u201d as well as \u201cour community and allies across New York City\u201d\u00a0to boycott the Post.\nYAMA issued a statement later Saturday saying that representatives would hold a press conference outside the Post\u2019s midtown Manhattan offices about the action on Sunday.\nOn Friday, Trump fell in line behind the Post\u00a0as he tweeted a video juxtaposing Omar\u2019s words with horrifying scenes of the terror attack. Trump added the message: \u201cWe will never forget!\u201d\u00a0\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear how long the boycott will last.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not the first time that the New York Post basically spreads hate and fear in their newspapers,\u201d Ayyad Algabyali, the merchant association\u2019s director of advocacy, told The Guardian. \u201cThis might be for good.\u201d\nThe Post could not immediately be reached for comment.\nPeople stepped up to support the boycott on Twitter and called for a consumer boycott of the newspaper.\nHere\u2019s a bit on the history of YAMA, which was formed after the 2017 bodega strike:", "date": "\n04/13/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/yemeni-bodega-association-boycotts-new-york-post_n_5cb2636ce4b098b9a2d49267", "tags": "american attack launch york yemeni yama omar bodegas \u201d front post new page boycott"}
