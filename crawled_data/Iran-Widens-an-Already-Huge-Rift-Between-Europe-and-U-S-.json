{"title": "Iran Widens an Already Huge Rift Between Europe and U.S.", "content": "BRUSSELS \u2014 Of all the issues dividing Europe and the Trump administration, Iran has become the sharpest, with the Europeans actively working against United States policy, placing them in league with Russia, China and Iran.\nSince earlier this year, when it pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal that was a centerpiece of former President Barack Obama\u2019s diplomacy, the Trump administration has pressed ahead with punishing sanctions against Tehran.\nThe leading countries of Europe, meanwhile, trying to preserve the nuclear accord, are looking to set up an alternative payment mechanism that would sidestep the American-dominated banking system, and Washington\u2019s new sanctions.\nAs they do so, they are pressing Iran to adhere strictly to the terms of the nuclear agreement, to avoid giving the United States and Israel a pretext for starting a war \u2014 an increasing concern.\nAnd they are counseling Tehran to keep calm and wait out President Trump\u2019s term, in the hope that he will not be re-elected, senior European diplomats say.\nThat, of course, could be wishful thinking, but the divergent policies toward Iran are leading to deeper tensions between the European Union and the Trump administration.\nLast month, the national security adviser, John R. Bolton, mocked the European Union for being \u201cstrong on rhetoric and weak on follow-through,\u201d adding: \u201cWe do not intend to allow our sanctions to be evaded by Europe or anyone else.\u201d\nMr. Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal \u201copened a rift between the U.S. and its European allies that is unlikely to close again as long as he is in office,\u201d wrote Volker Perthes, director of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin.\n\u201cEurope and the U.S. are not simply taking different approaches to Iran, but are actively working against one another in a policy field which is of significant strategic interest to both sides,\u201d he said.\nThe dispute over the Iran deal, he continued, \u201cis a major driver of European debates about a form of \u2018strategic autonomy\u2019 \u201d from the United States and represents a more serious cleavage in the Western alliance than did the invasion of Iraq in 2003.\nThe latest American sanctions against Iran, scheduled to take effect Nov. 4, will be the toughest so far, hitting the country\u2019s  oil industry and  central bank. The sale of Iranian oil and petrochemical products will be restricted, and foreign financial institutions will face sanctions for transactions with the Iranian central bank of other financial institutions designated under legislation Congress passed in 2012.\nTo get around the penalties, the Europeans are hoping to create a \u201cspecial purpose vehicle\u201d to allow payments related to Iranian exports, including oil, and Iranian imports, \u201cto assist and reassure economic operators pursuing legitimate business with Iran,\u201d according to the European Union.\nThe mechanism could use a form of barter, offsetting values of imports and exports priced in euros while avoiding banking transactions. The main objective is to allow Iran to keep selling its oil, on which much of its economy depends \u2014 exactly the reason Washington is trying to restrict that commerce.\nBut it remains unclear if the European efforts will succeed. Big multinational firms like Total, Peugeot, Renault, Eni, Siemens and Daimler are already pulling out of Iran, saying they cannot risk being shut out of the American financial system.\nIran\u2019s oil exports have declined significantly since August, putting pressure on supporters of the nuclear deal in Tehran and strengthening more hard-line elements that want to break the deal and start enriching uranium again, in greater quality as well as quantity.\n\u201cThe primary objective of the European Union is to provide a face-saving way for Iran to stay in the\u201d nuclear deal, said Ellie Geranmayeh of the European Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cThe Europeans are trying with Russia and China to create an economic package for Iran, but also some political steps to keep Iran in the deal, especially after Nov. 4.\u201d\nThe Europeans are also trying to help small and medium enterprises with little exposure in the United States to continue trading with Iran.\nThe question is how far the Trump administration will go to enforce sanctions, and whether it will allow waivers, as it has in the past, for work with Iran\u2019s civilian nuclear program, Ms. Geranmayeh said.\n\u201cBut if the deal collapses altogether, you can bet Iran will expand its nuclear program,\u201d she said, \u201cand that would put everyone back in the pre-2013 condition, and Europe especially does not want to be there.\u201d\nGiven the existing tensions between Iran and Sunni Arab states like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, not to speak of those with Israel, a war is not inconceivable.\nA conflict over Syria, especially with Iranian and Iranian-backed forces near the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, could create a pretext for Israel to bomb Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, as it wanted to do before the nuclear deal was signed. And while Mr. Obama restrained Israel, Mr. Trump might not.\nThe Europeans are telling Tehran that the nuclear pact is not just an economic deal, \u201cbut has important political and security dimensions for Iran, and so far Iran is listening,\u201d Ms. Geranmayeh said. Europe is emphasizing its efforts at de-escalating tensions, and has already had three meetings as part of a new security dialogue with Iran.\nWashington has said that the nuclear deal was faulty, in part because it did not restrain Iranian actions in the region, like its support for states and groups the Americans consider troublemakers: the Syrian government; Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite group; and Hamas, the militant group in Gaza.\nBut European governments say the Americans have done little to roll back Iranian influence. It is the Europeans who are trying to create a platform for dialogue with Iran and other regional actors, and who are pushing Iran to discuss its activities in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.\nThere is one other important difference, Ms. Geranmayeh said. While Washington now \u201csees no shades of gray in the Iranian leadership,\u201d she added, \u201cthe European Union countries, on the ground in Iran, see competitive factions inside the regime.\u201d\nThe Europeans are trying to support those in Iran, like Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and President Hassan Rouhani, whom they regard as more moderate, and whose political standing has been weakened by Mr. Trump\u2019s actions.\nJoseph Cirincione, a nuclear expert and the president of the Ploughshares Fund, which is committed to nonproliferation, wrote recently that the Trump administration seems to be heading toward a war in the Middle East.\nHe accused both Mr. Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo of \u201ccherry-picking intelligence and inflating threats,\u201d adding: \u201cThey\u2019re making specious connections between Iran and terrorists, including Al Qaeda and the Islamic State. And they\u2019re ratcheting up their rhetoric.\u201d\nThese tensions are about to get worse, Mr. Cirincione said, with the imposition of the stiff new sanctions. The likelihood that this pressure will explode into military conflict is rising dramatically,\u201d he said.\nHis dark view is precisely what European officials fear, and precisely why they are trying to persuade Iran to adhere to the nuclear deal, to modify its behavior in the region, and to wait out the Trump presidency.", "date": "Oct. 9, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/09/world/europe/europe-trump-iran.html", "tags": "iran widens european nuclear already \u201c europeans europe u.s rift iranian huge deal said"}
