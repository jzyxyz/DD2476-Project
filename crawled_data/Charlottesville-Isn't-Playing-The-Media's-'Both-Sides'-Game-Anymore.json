{"title": "Charlottesville Isn't Playing The Media's 'Both Sides' Game Anymore", "content": "CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. \u2015 The Associated Press reporter on the phone with Jalane Schmidt wanted two voices for her article: One would be Jason Kessler, the white supremacist who organized the Unite the Right rally here last year that left one dead and dozens injured. The other, the reporter hoped, would be Schmidt herself, a Black Lives Matter activist and associate professor of religious studies at the University of Virginia. \nThe story would be a debate, of sorts. Both sides would be represented.\n\u201cHell no,\u201d Schmidt said after she hung up.\nSchmidt gets a lot of calls from reporters. She can take you on a tour of Charlottesville with words alone. She\u2019ll tell the story of the slaves who worked on campus as students bustled to class through Nameless Field and the Rotunda, and juxtapose the image with that of torch-wielding white nationalists and Nazis who marched there on Aug. 11 last year. She\u2019s an expert on the white supremacy that has pervaded this city since its founding. It\u2019s only natural journalists would come to her.\nExcept a lot of journalists, locked into a mode of neutral reporting unsuited to stories about racism, also want \u201cthe other side.\u201d That\u2019s why, if you\u2019re reporting in Charlottesville, there\u2019s a question you\u2019ll have to answer if you want to interview certain activists, people of color, clergy members, educators and others affected by last year\u2019s Unite the Right rally:\nWill you also be interviewing a white supremacist for your article?\nIf the answer is anything but no, you\u2019re probably not getting your interview. A network of more than 40 activists like Schmidt \u2015 many of whom marched, provided respite, were injured or were otherwise affected during the violent white supremacist rallies on Aug. 11 and Aug. 12 \u2015 now take calls only if they have the green light from Charlottesville Anti-Racist Media Liaisons, a team of volunteers with a steadfast message for journalists seeking comment:\n\u201cNo platform for white supremacy,\u201d the group\u2019s Mimi Arbeit told HuffPost. \u201cNo face time, no interviews, no way. No platform to spread their violent views and actions.\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t some petty rule aimed at making reporters\u2019 jobs more difficult. Giving column inches to violent racists and white supremacists \u2015 like Kessler, or fellow UVa graduate and white supremacist Richard Spencer, or their pals \u2015 alongside local activists is creating an equivalency where none exists, tantamount to President Donald Trump saying there were good people \u201con both sides\u201d of the Charlottesville confrontations.\nJournalists are trained to seek out the two poles of any given question, as if truth could be found somewhere between them. This approach can have its virtues, but what happens when the question is about whether a class of people is fully human? Charlottesville Anti-Racist Media Liaisons members have no patience for any outlet that considers this a matter for debate. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a deep betrayal to the entire community of Charlottesville,\u201d Arbeit said. \u201cFascism uses the press to normalize itself and recruit followers and gain social power. The press is not a neutral player in history.\u201d\nIn Schmidt\u2019s telling, the Unite the Right rally wasn\u2019t exceptional; it was Charlottesville white supremacy, same as it ever was.\u00a0Not long before the city\u2019s Stonewall Jackson statue was unveiled in 1921, for instance, there was a Klan ceremony at Thomas Jefferson\u2019s Monticello. \u201cHundreds of Charlottesville\u2019s leading business and professional men\u201d attended, per Schmidt\u2019s research, and a cross-burning ceremony was held at Jefferson\u2019s tomb.\nWhile the expressions of white power became more genteel over the course of the 20th century, the underlying dynamic remained. That\u2019s what made Emancipation Park and UVa\u2019s campus so appealing to Nazis in the first place; it\u2019s why the Ku Klux Klan felt comfortable marching in town a month prior, and why Spencer felt safe coming back two months later; it\u2019s why locals are still fighting over monuments to slavery and the Confederacy that tower over courthouses, in parks, and on campus.\u00a0\nVery often the best ally to a white supremacist is a reporter stuck in neutral. In November, The New York Times dedicated 2,000 empathic words to \u201cthe Nazi sympathizer next door,\u201d giving him space in the newspaper of record to deny the Holocaust, demonize Trayvon Martin and \u201chail victory\u201d in Charlottesville, all in one story. \nIn their surface neutrality, these kinds of articles assume a liberal cosmopolitanism in readers that the very existence of the articles seemingly contradicts. If Americans could be counted on to recoil from baldly stated white supremacy, well, we wouldn\u2019t be here, would we?\nThis is where Charlottesville Anti-Racist Media Liaisons comes in. Formed in May 2017 in the aftermath of a tiki-torch rally in Charlottesville that was a precursor to the Unite the Right event, the group is made up of volunteer flacks and activists from various anti-racist organizations in town. They coordinate interviews between reporters and activists, issue press releases that identify different extremist groups and leaders so that local and national media know whom they\u2019re covering, and publicize anti-fascist action, when necessary. They also act as a go-between for activists who don\u2019t want to be identified by the press, but want to get a message out.\nIn recent months, various activists and representatives of the group have fielded calls from reporters who wanted to interview their people alongside Kessler or other extremists tied to the Unite the Right rally. Last year, they got similar requests after the KKK marched in town. The answer each time is no. Sometimes, they\u2019ll point to an Associated Press style guide on white nationalism and the alt-right, which suggests giving context when calling someone a white nationalist. Then they\u2019ll issue a press release with such context. A release from last year by Showing Up for Racial Justice, an adjacent activist group in Charlottesville, reads:\nThe activists of Charlottesville Anti-Racist Media Liaisons have seen up close how bad actors take advantage of the \u201cboth sides\u201d tendencies of the media.\nA few months prior to Unite the Right, Kessler was looking to get a local black politician fired. He surfaced some years-old tweets sent out by then-Vice Mayor Wes Bellamy. In one, from 2011, Bellamy reportedly retweeted a message about rape:\u00a0\u201cWord...RT: TAXSTONE: Eat it while she asleep if she moan it aint rape,\u201d the retweet read, according to the Cavalier Daily. In another: \u201cI\u2019m all for equal opportunity..but a Female Principal with a school full of female teachers is fkn a sure fire way to fk our lil boys up smh.\u201d\nSome of the tweets were certainly bad; others \u2014 \u201cI DONT LIK WHIT PEOPLE SO I HATE WHITE SNOW!!!!! FML!!!!\u201d\u00a0he reportedly tweeted in 2009 \u2014 were harmless. But they were all being offered up in fake outrage by a man whose agenda does not include standing up for the oppressed. And any story that allowed Kessler to cast himself as a concerned citizen was only helping his cause.\nKessler seized the opportunity and began a media tour to try and get Bellamy ousted from his seat on city council.\u00a0He found his mark in local freelancer Jackson Landers, who gave the white supremacist 1,000 words in C-VILLE Weekly to attack Bellamy\u2019s character. Prior to writing the story, Landers emailed local activist and lawyer Pam Starsia, wondering why she and her group, Showing Up for Racial Justice Charlottesville, were so up in arms about Kessler, rather than the vice mayor.\n\u201cI understand and agree with everything that you are saying about Kessler but what I\u2019m having trouble understanding is the strong support of Bellamy,\u201d Landers wrote in one email, provided to HuffPost by Starsia. \u201cWhat is the rationale for condemning one of these guys for his racist and sexist statements but excusing the other for his racist and sexist statements?\u201d\nThe point \u2015 that this was a bad-faith campaign launched in an attempt to unseat a black politician, not to mention that anti-white racism isn\u2019t a thing \u2015 had flown over Landers\u2019 head.\n\u201cHe was playing right into Kessler\u2019s thing,\u201d Starsia said this week. \u201cKessler wanted to attack a black man. I can\u2019t stress enough how hard Charlottesville fell for it. The media at the time was saying Wes\u2019 tweets were racist against white people.\u201d\nAnd, most egregious of all, the media let Kessler do all the talking. In Landers\u2019 story, Kessler was dubbed a \u201cconservative activist\u201d who wants, among other things, to preserve Confederate monuments in town because of their \u201cethnic significance to Southern white people.\u201d Landers even let Kessler define white supremacy in the piece:\nKessler\u2019s petition to remove Bellamy from office was later thrown out.\nLast week, Landers defended his story in an email to HuffPost, calling it an \u201caccurate piece of journalism.\u201d He said Kessler \u201chadn\u2019t shown an open affinity for Nazis or the KKK,\u201d though he admitted that he wouldn\u2019t allow Kessler to define white supremacy today.\n\u201cI think I may have been the first person to write any sort of article about Jason Kessler\u2019s antics,\u201d Landers said. But he wanted to make clear: \u201cIt is a fact that Wes Bellamy tweeted those statements and as a sitting politician that becomes news.\u201d\nThese are the types of stories that piss off local activists the most \u2014 the stories that soften or euphemize Kessler\u2019s intentions. The ones that make him the protagonist. \u201cKessler Harassed On Downtown Mall by SURJ,\u201d reads a headline. \u201cConfederate statue supporter Jason Kessler,\u201d someone writes. \u201cLocal blogger Jason Kessler,\u201d says another.\n\u201cThe feeling of being in close proximity to Nazis and in confrontation with Nazis is a weekly experience in Charlottesville,\u201d Arbeit said. \u201cPeople still living in Charlottesville have not stepped away from that visceral trauma, and we have to relive it regularly. We have a lot of court dates for Nazis being tried for violent crimes, we have lawsuits against them, we have lawsuits over the [Confederate monuments], the targeting of black men who defended themselves on Aug. 12, and constant threats.\u201d\nThat looming threat is that Arbeit and other activists draw a hard line when it comes to showing \u201ccivility\u201d to hateful people.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not debating. We\u2019re fighting against a genocidal agenda,\u201d she said, noting that Charlottesville Anti-Racist Media Liaisons keeps tabs on news reports that give white supremacy a platform. \u201cThe people have not forgotten or forgiven.\u201d", "date": "\n08/07/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/charlottesville-isnt-playing-the-medias-both-sides-game-anymore_n_5b63390ce4b0b15abaa0e48b", "tags": "game media landers \u201d white \u2015 sides charlottesville playing kessler activists anymore"}
