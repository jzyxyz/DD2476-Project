An attorney for Cohen said the FBI was acting in part on a referral from Mueller.\u00a0\u00a0\nEarlier on Monday, Trump floated the idea of firing the special counsel.\u00a0\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t I just fire Mueller?\u201d\u00a0he asked in response to a reporter\u2019s question. \u201cWell, I think it\u2019s a disgrace what\u2019s going on. We\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d\nTrump also said \u201cmany people have said\u201d he should sack Mueller. Dobbs is certainly one of them.\u00a0\nDobbs used his show to slam the entire Justice Department as well.\n\u201cIf there\u2019s anyone in this country who thinks that this Department of Justice leadership is competent, is impartial and fair and committed to justice instead of a partisan result in the interests of the deep state and not the United States of America, then they haven\u2019t been paying attention to anything \u2015 anything \u2015 that\u2019s been going on in the nation\u2019s capital,\u201d he said.\nDobbs has long advocated for Trump on the air. Last year, he described Trump as \u201cpretty close to perfect.\u201d He\u2019s also boasted about his support for the president.\n\u201cI hope he would consider me a friend and supporter,\u201d\u00a0Dobbs told the Washington Post last year, \u201cbecause I have been, on the air, from day one.\u201d", "date": "\n04/10/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/lou-dobbs-fire-robert-mueller_n_5acc2f69e4b07a3485e7af64", "tags": "sob dobbs tv live urges would \u201d trump robert lou \u2015 cohen flips mueller"}
