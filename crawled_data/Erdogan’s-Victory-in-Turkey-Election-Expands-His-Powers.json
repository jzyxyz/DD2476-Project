{"title": "Erdogan\u2019s Victory in Turkey Election Expands His Powers", "content": "ANKARA, Turkey \u2014 Turkish voters gave President Recep Tayyip Erdogan a decisive victory in national elections on Sunday, lengthening his 15-year grip on power and granting him vastly expanded authority over the legislature and judiciary.\nThe election was the first to be held since Turkish voters narrowly approved a referendum last year to give the president \u2014 once a largely ceremonial role \u2014 sweeping executive powers. Mr. Erdogan will also have a pliant Parliament, with his conservative party and its allies having won about 53 percent of the vote in legislative elections on Sunday.\nMr. Erdogan has overseen a crackdown on lawyers, judges, civil servants and journalists under a state of emergency declared after a failed coup two years ago. His critics had portrayed Sunday\u2019s election as their last chance to prevent Turkey from becoming an authoritarian state.\nThe victory has potentially grave consequences for cooperation within NATO, security in Iraq and Syria, and control of immigration flows into Europe.\nTurkey has continued to cooperate with its Western partners on counterterrorism efforts, but Mr. Erdogan has tested the NATO alliance by drawing closer to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, buying an advanced Russian missile defense system and planning a Russian-built nuclear reactor in Turkey.\nAs in other countries where strongmen have gained at the ballot box, many Turkish voters appeared to have accepted Mr. Erdogan\u2019s argument that powerful centralized authority was essential to forge a strong state and guard against the threat of terrorism.\nThe results released by the official Anadolu news agency showed Mr. Erdogan with just under 53 percent of the vote, enough to spare him from a runoff against his leading challenger, Muharrem Ince, who won nearly 31 percent.\nAt 10:30 p.m., Mr. Erdogan, 64, gave a short televised speech to applauding supporters at the gates of Huber Pavilion, one of his residences in Istanbul.\n\u201cIt seems the nation has entrusted me with the duty of the presidency, and to us a very big responsibility in the legislature,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said. \u201cTurkey has given a lesson of democracy with a turnout of close to 90 percent. I hope that some will not provoke to hide their own failure.\u201d\nMr. Erdogan said he would travel to Ankara, the capital, to make his traditional victory speech from the balcony of his party headquarters.\nFlag-waving crowds gathered after midnight at the party headquarters, waiting for him to appear. He finally emerged at 3 a.m. Monday.\nMr. Erdogan acknowledged that his own party had taken a hit in the campaign, but said the result was a vindication of his ability to deliver. \u201cThe winner is the politics of providing services,\u201d he said. \u201cThe winner is the supremacy of the national will. The winner is Turkey, the Turkish nation. The winner is all the aggrieved people in our region, all the oppressed in the world.\u201d\nOpposition parties initially called his claim of victory premature, but after midnight, Bulent Tezcan, the vice chairman of Mr. Ince\u2019s party, the Republican People\u2019s Party, conceded defeat in a brief televised speech.\n\u201cOur citizens should not be provoked, whatever the result is,\u201d he said, urging his supporters to continue their campaign for democracy through peaceful means.\nThe victory means Mr. Erdogan will almost certainly make good on his desire to become the country\u2019s longest-ruling leader, surpassing Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, who founded the modern Turkish republic out of the ruins of the collapsed Ottoman Empire.\nUnder the new system brought in by last year\u2019s referendum, Mr. Erdogan can run for a second term as president \u2014 and a third, if he were to call an early election \u2014 opening the possibility that he could stay in office until 2032.\nIn parliamentary races, Mr. Erdogan\u2019s party placed first, with more than 42 percent of the vote, the Anadolu agency reported, enough to retain a majority in alliance with the Nationalist Movement Party, which received about 11 percent.\nDefenders of Turkey\u2019s multiparty democracy did receive some cause for hope: The H.D.P. party, a liberal democratic party that emphasizes minority rights and is led by an imprisoned Kurd, Selahattin Demirtas, surpassed the 10 percent threshold needed to enter Parliament.\nThe deputy head of the Supreme Election Board said five parties had passed the threshold.\nSoner Cagaptay, a scholar and author who has called Mr. Erdogan a \u201cnew sultan\u201d in the vein of the absolute rulers of the Ottoman Empire, said the new Parliament would be the most politically diverse in 35 years, with nearly every major political faction represented.\nSupport for Mr. Erdogan appeared to be similar to its level in last year\u2019s constitutional referendum, \u201csuggesting that polarization around his simultaneously adored and loathed persona continues to divide Turkey,\u201d Mr. Cagaptay said.\nAmanda Sloat, an Obama administration official who is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said that \u201cone of the country\u2019s biggest challenges for the foreseeable future remains the deep polarization of Turkish society.\u201d\nShe said Mr. Erdogan\u2019s reliance on the Nationalist Movement Party for its majority \u201cmeans foreign policy will likely remain influenced by nationalist considerations.\u201d\nBut she said the hard-fought election showed that Turkish democracy was resilient.\n\u201cThe opposition parties ran surprisingly strong, energetic and competitive campaigns,\u201d Ms. Sloat said. \u201cParliament will be diverse, with the coalition system ensuring the representation of a wide range of parties \u2014 including the Kurds.\u201d\nThe victory for Mr. Erdogan and his allies appeared to defy last-minute polls indicating that they were in danger. The final opinion poll conducted by the independent Metropoll suggested that Mr. Erdogan might suffer a double blow, being forced into a second round of voting for the presidency and losing control of Parliament.\nThe election was seen in large measure as a referendum on Mr. Erdogan\u2019s rule, with many voters expressing concerns about what they say is his growing authoritarian streak and a struggling economy, which they blame on corruption and mismanagement.\nThe economy, once a strong point for Mr. Erdogan, has stumbled badly in the last year. Turkey has accumulated significant foreign debt, the Turkish lira has lost 20 percent of its value and direct foreign investment has plunged as investors have been scared off by the president\u2019s increasingly belligerent and anti-Western tone.\nThe economic turmoil may make Mr. Erdogan more careful about picking fights with the West, but it could also spell growing unrest and political challenges at home against a newly energized and unified opposition.\nBekir Agirdir, founder of the polling firm Konda, predicted that Mr. Erdogan would struggle to rule the country: His constitutional changes in 2017 to create an executive presidency were approved narrowly, 51 percent to 49 percent.\n\u201cHe cannot rule the remaining 49 percent,\u201d Mr. Agirdir said in an interview before Sunday\u2019s election. He suggested that Mr. Erdogan was bound to see a showdown eventually. \u201cThis is the rehearsal. The real election will be in two to three years\u2019 time.\u201d\nMany in the opposition saw the campaign as a final chance to save democracy. \u201cWe are crossing the last bridge before it falls,\u201d said Burcu Akcaru, a founder of the new Good Party. \u201cThen we leave the country.\u201d\nMr. Erdogan called the election two months ago \u2014 they had not been expected until November 2019 \u2014 in hopes of scoring a big win that he maintained would be a turning point for the country, allowing him to create a stronger, more powerful state.\nWhen he came to power 15 years ago, Mr. Erdogan won wide support as a pro-European, moderate Islamist who supported democracy and economic liberalization. But over the years the earlier philosophy was replaced by a more personal and dictatorial rule, particularly after the failed coup in July 2016. Along the way, he either abandoned or alienated many of his allies.\nThe new presidential system will codify the executive powers Mr. Erdogan has already been exercising under the state of emergency. Under the new system, the office of prime minister, which Mr. Erdogan held from 2003 to 2014, will be abolished. The cabinet will be composed of presidential appointees rather than elected lawmakers. And Parliament\u2019s powers are reduced, including oversight of the budget.\nMr. Erdogan has imprisoned many of his critics, including thousands of Kurdish politicians and activists, members of civil society organizations, and Islamists accused of being followers of Fethullah Gulen, the cleric whom Turkish leaders accuse of organizing the coup attempt.\nDevlet Bahceli, the leader of the Nationalist Movement Party, whose result on Sunday ensures the alliance\u2019s parliamentary majority for Mr. Erdogan, said of the opposition: \u201cThey wanted to demolish us, they couldn\u2019t manage; they wanted to ravage us, they failed.\u201d\n\u201cThose who spell disasters hit the consciousness of Turkishness and fell apart,\u201d he said.\nThe election\u2019s losers must now figure out how to maintain a voice in an increasingly authoritarian nation.\nMr. Demirtas, the imprisoned Kurdish leader whose left-leaning minority-rights party won 11 percent of the vote, had urged Turks to vote against Mr. Erdogan and his allies, encouraging them to grab an opportunity before entering a \u201cdark and obscure tunnel.\u201d\n\u201cWhat you go through nowadays is only a trailer of the one-man regime. The most frightening part of the movie hasn\u2019t even started yet,\u201d he warned. \u201cEverything will be arranged in accordance with the desire, pleasure and interests of one man. You will feel unable to breathe in a regime of fear and despair; you will feel like you are strangled.\u201d", "date": "June 24, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/24/world/europe/turkey-election-erdogan.html", "tags": "turkey election percent powers victory party \u201d turkish expands erdogan"}
