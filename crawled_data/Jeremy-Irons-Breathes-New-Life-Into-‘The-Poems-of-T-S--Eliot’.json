Faber & Faber.\nThere is no definitive voice for reading T. S. Eliot. His own manner, with its proper enunciations, can\u2019t be placed. He was always from somewhere else. In his native St. Louis, his family looked to ancestral New England; at Harvard, he came from a \u201cborder state.\u201d As a newcomer to London, teaching schoolboys in Highgate, he was \u201cthe American master.\u201d He discarded his American accent without ever coming to sound unquestionably English. I wish it were possible to consult Professor Higgins: Can there be a neutral delivery, devoid of geographical cadence? The recordings of Eliot\u2019s poems try for transparency; lasting content takes precedence over any one reader at a single point in time.\nJeremy Irons sounds the ominous lines \u2014 \u201cThis is the dead land\u201d \u2014 in the velvet of the trained English voice. It suits such a play of innuendo as when the timorous Prufrock of Eliot\u2019s first major poem observes cultured women who \u201ccome and go / Talking of Michelangelo.\u201d As written, the words appear noncommittal, yet the rhyme implies the patness of what these women have to say. Irons amplifies Prufrock\u2019s opinion using a beat of silence to represent the space on the page. Similarly, he later marks the unspoken beats that follow Prufrock\u2019s truncated line: \u201cDo I dare?\u201d\nEliot is the master of the unsaid. Irons\u2019s sensitivity to Prufrock\u2019s hesitation on the brink of utterance allows the poetry to bring out a prophetic impulse without sounding entirely absurd: \u201cDo I dare / Disturb the universe?\u201d\nLike other great readers of Eliot (among them John Gielgud and Alec Guinness), Irons combines the velvet with emotionally alert variations in pace. With the line \u201cIt is impossible to say just what I mean!,\u201d he speeds up the frustration seething beneath Prufrock\u2019s genteel front, complete with formal necktie. Irons makes a bold decision to let loose the speaker\u2019s longing, to the point of a sigh, and he is wonderfully suggestive in the variations on \u201cShantih shantih shantih\u201d echoing on at the end of \u201cThe Waste Land.\u201d I used to wonder if \u201cthe peace which passeth understanding,\u201d Eliot\u2019s note to this word, was building or fading. The poet\u2019s own deadpan reading did not provide an answer, but Irons comes down on uncertainty with three different intonations. His final, stretched-out \u201cShantih\u201d injects a strange intimacy following a thunderous \u201cDA,\u201d announcing rain \u2014 water as a sign of the spiritual fertility that Eliot longed for all his life.\nIrons voices an Eliot who craves, desires and suffers more openly than in the sober accents of Gielgud and Guinness. Their recordings, completed during the poet\u2019s lifetime, perhaps felt the impress of Eliot\u2019s neutrality. Yet for them, and for Irons too, the poet appears one of us, which is to say that in all these recordings Eliot becomes more English than I think he really was. Irons glides smoothly over a barrage of judgments in \u201cMarina,\u201d \u201cDeath\u201d being embodied in \u201cThose who sit in the sty of contentment\u201d and in \u201cThose who suffer the ecstasy of the animals.\u201d Here is an annihilation of the flesh worthy of his Puritan forebear Andrew Eliott of Salem, a juror in the witchcraft trials.\nInstead, Irons lends himself to what coexists with the voice of judgment: what is hesitant, what feels unattainable and the struggles of a flawed being in \u201cFour Quartets.\u201d A high point is when Eileen Atkins joins Irons in the best \u201cWaste Land\u201d reading ever in terms of interpretation and play of voices. Listen especially to the repartee of a man and a woman caged together in a hellish union. Their emotional duo and the naturalness that Irons brings to Eliot make this set of CDs a special gift.", "date": "May 17, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/17/books/review/poems-ts-eliot.html", "tags": "voice \u2018 t.s irons prufrock poems breathes eliot shantih \u201d english jeremy reading recordings new life"}
