{"title": "House Votes For Anti-Semitism Resolution As GOP Shifts Ilhan Omar Narrative For Democrats", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2015 After a week of internal debate and torment, Democrats looked to put the controversy surrounding Rep. Ilhan Omar\u2019s latest comments behind them on Thursday with a vote on a resolution that was seen as an indirect rebuke of the Minnesota Democrat. \nBut ultimately it wasn\u2019t anything Democrats did that may change the damaging narrative. It was the decision of 23 Republicans to vote against the resolution.\nHouse lawmakers voted 407-23 to condemn a wide range of hate speech and bigotry in a resolution that morphed from an admonishment of Omar to a 7-page measure condemning hate in all forms. Twenty-three\u00a0GOP lawmakers opposed the legislation seemingly because it didn\u2019t single out Omar, though it was notable that many of the no votes came from some of the most far-right members of Congress.\nIt was a saving grace for Democrats that the 23 Republicans decided to vote no on the resolution. (GOP Rep. Steve King of Iowa, who\u2019s had a far lengthier history of problematic statements, was the lone present vote.) Those Republicans took heat off their counterparts during a week in which the Democrats have been unable to quash the Omar story themselves.\nThe wide-ranging resolution that Omar herself supported simply wasn\u2019t enough for those Republicans, and it still might not be enough to appease some Democrats who wanted a direct reprimand \u2015 or to just finally bury the controversy. But the vote does muddle the narrative that this problem singularly belongs to the Democrats.\nUp until the vote, the Omar controversy was one that divided Democrats and united Republicans. It was, after all, a small group of veteran Democrats who pressured Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) into holding a vote on a resolution, after Omar said recently that she wanted to discuss \u201cthe political influence in this country that says it is OK for people to push for allegiance to a foreign country.\u201d \nMany saw her comments \u2015 taken in combination with previous remarks \u2015 as a dig against pro-Israel lobbying. But Omar and some other Democrats argue they should have the ability to criticize Israel without fear of being labeled an anti-Semite. Ultimately, Democratic leadership split the difference by voting on a broad resolution that called out \u201caccusing Jews of being more loyal to Israel or to the Jewish community than to the United States\u201d as anti-Semitism, while also deploring multiple forms of Islamophobia and white supremacy.\nAt the urging of some veteran Democrats \u2015 including Reps. Eliot Engel, Nita Lowey and Jerrold Nadler (all three of whom chair committees, are Jewish and represent districts in New York state) \u2015 Pelosi agreed over the weekend to hold a vote on a resolution. But other Democrats pushed back, arguing that the speaker was playing into the hands of Republicans who have looked to paint Omar as an anti-Semite. \nOn Wednesday, a closed-door meeting with Democrats turned ugly when some lawmakers began attacking each other. Pelosi actually walked out of the meeting after freshman Rep. Jahana Hayes (D-Conn.) questioned why she had learned about the resolution from MSNBC instead of from House leadership.\nWith many Democrats taking issue with how their leaders had decided to move forward, those leaders actually considered burying the resolution. But they also worried that doing nothing would drag out the story even longer, potentially allowing Republicans to offer a procedural motion deploring anti-Semitism on Friday, which would distract attention from Democrats passing the long-awaited voting rights bill, H.R. 1.\nBy Thursday morning, Democratic leadership decided to move ahead with the vote. They also decided it should be written so broadly that Omar wouldn\u2019t feel singled out. (Omar has received hours of coverage on cable news, been the focus of hundreds of articles and received death threats.)\nStill, because the resolution seemed to call out everything, some lawmakers felt it effectively called out nothing. \nRep. Ted Deutch (D-Fla.) spoke on the floor Thursday contending that the resolution was inadequate.\u00a0\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t we able to singularly condemn anti-Semitism? Why can\u2019t we call it anti-Semitism and show that we\u2019ve learned the lessons of history?\u201d Deutch said.\nHe added that it seemed like Congress was only willing to address anti-Semitism in the context of \u201call forms of hatred.\u201d\n\u201cIf feels like we can\u2019t say it\u2019s anti-Semitism unless everyone agrees that it\u2019s anti-Semitism,\u201d Deutch said.\n\u201cAny attack must be condemned when it\u2019s based on hatred. But when a colleague invokes classic anti-Semitic lies three times, then this body must condemn that anti-Semitism,\u201d he said.\nHuffPost also overheard Engel telling Rep. Mike McCaul (R-Texas) on Thursday that the resolution was \u201cridiculous.\u201d While Engel was more reserved in a later interview, he nonetheless made it clear that he didn\u2019t feel the resolution went far enough.\n\u201cI can only talk for me, and I condemned every statement that was made by my colleague, and I will continue to do it if anyone does anything wrong,\u201d Engel said.\nEngel later spoke on the floor to say he was voting for the resolution, but regretted there wasn\u2019t a separate measure condemning what Omar said and suggested that he\u2019d work with anyone \u2015 presumably Republicans in the form of a motion to recommit \u2015 to secure a more targeted vote.\nRepublicans on Thursday also lambasted the resolution on the House floor for calling out so many forms of hate, and it was that contention that seemed to ultimately lead 24 Republicans \u2015 counting King\u2019s present vote \u2015 not to support the resolution.\nOmar has faced an onslaught of criticism from colleagues, both Republicans and Democrats, but it was the Democratic infighting that was receiving all the attention before.\nOn Twitter, Lowey said\u00a0that lawmakers should be able to debate issues without \u201cprejudice or bigotry,\u201d continuing that she was \u201csaddened\u201d that Omar \u201cmischaracterizes support for Israel.\u201d\u00a0\nRep. Juan Vargas (D-Calif.) tweeted that he found it \u201cdisturbing\u201d that Omar was perpetuating \u201churtful anti-Semitic stereotypes,\u201d which in turn earned him a quote tweet from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who asked him to explain his stance that it\u2019s unacceptable to question U.S. foreign policy.\nThe online back-and-forths prompted Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) to implore her colleagues on Wednesday to quit it. \u201cEveryone stop tweeting!\u201d she said during the closed-door meeting.\nOn Thursday, Pelosi herself seemed to defend Omar. She said the resolution \u2015 which was initially intended as a rebuke of Omar \u2015 wasn\u2019t about the first-term congresswoman. \u201cIt\u2019s about these forms of hatred,\u201d Pelosi claimed.\nThe speaker said she didn\u2019t think that Omar intended her statement to be \u201canti-Semitic in any way.\u201d But Pelosi also said that she didn\u2019t think Omar understood \u201cthe full weight of the words\u201d and that when the statement was interpreted as anti-Semitic, \u201cwe have to remove all doubt.\u201d\nWith the vote Thursday, Democrats took a step toward moving beyond the Omar controversy. What we may end up remembering about this resolution, in a few months or years, is that 23 Republicans voted against it.", "date": "\n03/07/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/house-anti-semitism-resolution-ilhan-omar_n_5c8176e0e4b0ed0a0011437f", "tags": "resolution democrats anti-semitism shifts gop omar \u201d house \u2015 republicans narrative ilhan votes vote rep."}
