{"title": "Slow Police Response and Chaos Contributed to Parkland Massacre, Report Finds", "content": "MIAMI \u2014 In the weeks after a deadly school shooting in Parkland, Fla., widespread criticism was focused on Scot Peterson, the armed sheriff\u2019s deputy who heard the exploding gunfire but failed to run in and try to stop the massacre.\nBut a state commission that has been investigating the Feb. 14 attack at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School for the past 10 months found that the shortfall in the police response went much further: Seven other sheriff\u2019s deputies who raced to the school and heard gunshots also stayed outside the building, the commission found, and officers lost even more time scrambling to retrieve bulletproof vests from their cars.\nA total of 17 students and staff members lost their lives in an attack that spanned a full six minutes; 17 others were injured.\nThe draft report released Wednesday by no means lifted blame from Mr. Peterson, who the investigation showed had told some of the other officers to stay away from the building where students were being gunned down. But it pointed to a range of other failures on the part of school and law enforcement officials that likely contributed to a shooting so deadly that it set off a national youth movement against gun violence.\nA campus security monitor saw the gunman enter the building and was suspicious, but did nothing to alert students. Mental health counselors knew the gunman was troubled, but never had a complete picture of just how dangerous he had become.\nIn a separate set of statements released by the authorities on Wednesday, officers described a bloody, chaotic scene as they arrived.\n\u201cIt\u2019s basically like a \u2018Apocalypse Now,\u2019 \u201d Hank Juntunen, a sheriff\u2019s deputy, said of the scene he and other officers encountered on the third floor of the school building where the shooting occurred.\nThe 22 officers interviewed as part of the commission\u2019s investigation described radios that did not work, and problems communicating between law enforcement agencies and medical responders.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t key up\u201d on the radio, Deputy Brian Hayes said, describing his attempts to call paramedics to help the injured. \u201cLike, it was just a tone, a tone, a tone.\u201d\nThe Parkland Commission\u2019s 400-page draft report, based on a detailed examination of timelines, emergency response records and testimony from witnesses, police, school officials and others, called for a full internal evaluation of the police response, given the commission\u2019s finding that eight deputies from the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Office ignored protocol for active shooters that calls for pursuing a gunman to try to disarm him.\nOther officers who came later did go in as soon as they arrived, the report noted.\n\u201cNone of these BSO deputies immediately responded to the gun shots by entering the campus and seeking out the shooter,\u201d the report said. \u201cDeputy sheriffs who took the time to retrieve vests from containers in their cruisers, removed certain equipment they were wearing so that they could put on their vests, and then replaced the equipment they had removed all while shots were being fired, or had been recently fired, is unacceptable and contrary to accepted protocol.\u201d\nSheriff Scott Israel, a Democrat who has been widely criticized for defending his office\u2019s response to the shooting, has already placed two of the deputies on restricted duty. When he testified before the commission last month, he had few answers as to why his officers did not pursue the gunman.\n\u201cYou just can\u2019t measure heart,\u201d Sheriff Israel said.\nHis office will conduct its own investigation after receiving the commission\u2019s final findings on Jan. 1, Sheriff Israel said in a statement on Wednesday.\nThe commission\u2019s report still could be revised, but lists tentative findings and recommendations to local officials and state lawmakers, including a controversial suggestion that the state consider allowing teachers who volunteer for training to carry weapons to school. The commission, led by the Republican sheriff of Pinellas County, Bob Gualtieri, has not made any recommendations related to gun policy.\n\u201cClassroom teachers cannot and should not be distracted with the responsibility of being armed inside a classroom, even if they think they want to,\u201d Debbie Hixon, a Broward County schoolteacher whose husband, Chris Hixon, was killed in the Stoneman Douglas High attack, told the commission on Wednesday in Tallahassee. \u201cThe probability of something going wrong clearly outweighs that one time that there may be a shooting in the classroom.\u201d\nFlorida already tightened gun laws and introduced a number of school safety requirements in the wake of the shooting. But change has proved expensive and slow, frustrating parents of the Parkland victims, including two fathers who sit on the commission. Sheriff Israel and Superintendent Robert W. Runcie of the Broward County public school district have said they are awaiting the final commission findings to make more personnel moves or adopt new policies, if needed.\n\u201cWe are studying the observations to deepen our understanding of what happened, who was responsible, and what might have been done differently,\u201d Kathy Koch, a spokeswoman for the school district, said in a statement on Wednesday.\nLast month, the school district reassigned three Stoneman Douglas assistant principals and a security specialist as a result of the commission investigation, which identified a number of security failures, beginning with a pedestrian gate left open and unsupervised that allowed the accused gunman, a former student who should not have been on campus, to walk into the school.\nAn unarmed campus security monitor saw the gunman walking toward the freshman building carrying a suspicious bag. \u201cSomething inside me told me not to approach him,\u201d the security monitor told the sheriff\u2019s office.\nBut the security monitor did not chase after the gunman or go on his school radio to call a \u201ccode red.\u201d\nThe gunman entered the building immediately after three students, who were unaware that someone suspicious was just steps behind them. Two of those students, Martin Duque, 14, and Luke Hoyer, 15, were among the first fatalities. The third student was injured.\nOn Wednesday, Sheriff Gualtieri criticized the security monitor \u2014 who has since been fired, along with a second security monitor \u2014 for failing to alert the students or anyone else about the gunman\u2019s presence. A code red was called by a third security monitor more than three minutes into the shooting. Two other security monitors, Aaron Feis and Mr. Hixon, ran into the building and were killed.\n\u201cThere could have been a serious mitigation of this if people had been notified and had an opportunity to react,\u201d Sheriff Gualtieri said.\nSome students were hurt because there was nowhere for them to hide. Only two of 30 classrooms in the freshman building had clearly marked \u201chard corners\u201d where students would not be seen by an attacker peering in through the glass pane on the classroom door. In several other classrooms, the hard corners were obstructed by furniture, including teachers\u2019 desks, and were too small to fit all the students, leaving some of them exposed.\n\u201cCruz only shot people within his line of sight and he never entered any classroom,\u201d the draft report said, referring to the accused gunman, Nikolas Cruz.\nThe report said that Mr. Cruz began searching shootings online months before the rampage. Investigators found that he used his cellphone on Nov. 14, 2017, to search for \u201cshooting people massacre.\u201d Several Instagram accounts linked to Mr. Cruz also included posts about killing people, and Mr. Cruz wrote several notes in his cellphone expressing his desire to hurt others.\n\u201cEverything and everyone is happy except for me I want to kill people but I don\u2019t know how I can do it,\u201d he wrote in a note on Jan. 21.\nBeginning in February, in the days leading up to the shooting, Mr. Cruz\u2019s online activity related to violence appeared to increase. He searched for Wikipedia entries, news articles and videos about past shootings, including at Columbine High School in Colorado and at Virginia Tech; viewed videos and forums about shooting with a rifle; and typed in a chilling internet search query: \u201cis killing people easy.\u201d\nHe took a screenshot of the Stoneman Douglas school schedule and of a psychology article regarding \u201chomicidal thoughts or urges.\u201d On Feb. 8, he recorded a video of himself saying he would go upstairs at a Stoneman Douglas building and shoot into the main school courtyard. Investigators found that Mr. Cruz, who had a legally purchased AR-15 assault rifle, tried to shoot from the third floor of the freshman building into crowds of students outside, but his bullets could not penetrate the windows\u2019 hurricane-resistant glass.\nMr. Cruz, now 20, was arrested in a residential neighborhood near the school on the day of the shooting. He confessed to the police and was charged with capital murder. He is in jail awaiting trial, though his public defenders have said he would plead guilty in exchange for a sentence of life in prison.\nPerhaps the most troubling of the commission\u2019s findings was that the shooting\u2019s grim death toll could have been even higher.\nAbout 800 students, teachers and staff were in the freshman building that day, according to the report. On the third floor, people could not immediately hear the shooting on the two floors below. More than 100 students filed out of their classrooms there and into the hallway after hearing the fire alarm set off by the gunman\u2019s shots. Only when a teacher standing by the stairwell realized what was going on did most of those children return to the relative safety of their classrooms \u2014 before the gunman made it to the third floor.\nSix minutes into his rampage, the gunman dropped his weapon and left the building, blending in with hundreds of other students who were evacuating.\nThe report noted one other detail from its findings: He left behind 180 rounds of ammunition.", "date": "Dec. 12, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/12/us/parkland-shooting-florida-commission-report.html", "tags": "finds commission contributed shooting gunman sheriff slow report building massacre \u201d school chaos response parkland police students"}
