{"title": "Protest at Gaza Fence Is Mostly Peaceful as Both Sides Urge Restraint", "content": "NAHAL OZ, Israel \u2014 Tens of thousands of Palestinians returned to the borderland between Gaza and Israel on Saturday for a largely peaceful protest marking the first anniversary of demonstrations that have frequently led to violent clashes with Israeli troops.\nDespite efforts by both sides to minimize casualties, hundreds of protesters rushed the fence, some hurling homemade bombs, and three were killed.\nAfter a round of violence on Monday that began when a rocket fired from Gaza wounded several Israelis north of Tel Aviv and ended after Israel spent a day pounding targets in Gaza, neither side was eager for a new war, least of all Israel, which is 10 days away from elections.\nEgyptian intermediaries worked with both sides to keep the situation from boiling over, and Hamas, the militant Islamic group that controls Gaza, deployed scores of people in orange vests to keep most demonstrators at least 300 yards from the fence, the distance Israel had demanded as a buffer.\nThe Israeli military had prepared for an escalation this weekend, moving tanks, artillery and four brigades of soldiers to the Gaza border, but they mostly held their fire.\nThere was some suggestion that Israel might offer concessions in exchange for a peaceful protest. Hamas officials said vaguely that Gazans would soon reap benefits. On Saturday morning, the Israeli army\u2019s Arabic-language spokesman said on social media that peaceful protests would be rewarded.\nThe Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu made no mention of any deal but issued a statement thanking the military for \u201cthe aggressive activity and massive preparations that helped bring about calm.\u201d\nWhile neither side offered specifics, it appeared that their efforts were having some success in curtailing violence.\nThere were skirmishes at the fence, parts of which Israel had fortified in advance of Saturday\u2019s anniversary with steel plates topped by tall, heavy wire-mesh fencing, and bunkers built atop large earthen berms, where hundreds of snipers were positioned.\nTear gas canisters arced across from Israeli jeeps, and dozens of homemade bombs were thrown from the Gaza side. But the violence was nothing like it has been at times in the year since the start of the protests, dubbed the Great March of Return.\nThe Israeli military, while welcoming the reduced violence, took the de-escalation as proof of its assertions that the tone of the protests was entirely dictated by Hamas.\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that Hamas controls the level of violence,\u201d said Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a military spokesman. \u201cWhen they want less violence, we see that they can keep people back from the fence. And when they want more violence, they get more violence.\u201d\nThe yearlong protest has had several objectives. It was aimed above all at ending the years-old Israeli-led blockade of Gaza, which has restricted the movement of people and goods in and out of the territory and blockaded its access to the Mediterranean. The protest also focused on Palestinians\u2019 demands to return to their ancestral lands in what is now Israel. But it has mainly served to draw international attention to the Israel-Palestinian conflict at a time when that has been hard to come by.\nIsrael made a point before Saturday of cautioning its soldiers against taking shots that might hit unintended targets, the kind that Israeli officials acknowledged had killed  a Palestinian medic, Rouzan al-Najjar, last June, one of some 196 people killed in the protests.\nIn addition, the military said it was experimenting with new forms of nonlethal crowd control, including a device that essentially fires a rifle-shot of sound at a target.\nBut soldiers did use live ammunition on Saturday. The Gaza Health Ministry reported three fatalities and more than 200 people injured, including 46 by gunshots.\nAt the largest protest site, east of Gaza City, where nearly 10,000 people had gathered by early afternoon, participants lit campfires and brewed tea, a band played and a troupe danced the debka, a traditional Palestinian dance.\nThere were early signs this would be a relatively tame day, including a noticeably large presence of Hamas security and intelligence officers, and the placement of vast public tents some 700 yards from the fence, more than twice the distance from the barrier as on previous protest days.\nVague promises of Israeli concessions were not enough for everyone, however.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want the blockade lifted partially,\u201d said Umm Wael, 45, a teacher. \u201cWe want it lifted completely. Lift the blockade or martyrdom.\u201d\nAnd Muhammad al-Serhi, 34, who has a part-time job at a dessert shop and said he came to the protests to escape the \u201csuffocation\u201d he feels at home, said he was in the dark about what was happening.\n\u201cWe only hear that there are solutions,\u201d he said. \u201cI will believe that there are solutions when the borders are open, when there are job opportunities.\u201d", "date": "March 30, 2019", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/30/world/middleeast/gaza-protest-anniversary.html", "tags": "protest mostly fence \u201c restraint urge israel gaza sides israeli violence peaceful saturday"}
