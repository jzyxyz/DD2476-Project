{"title": "Here's The Skinny On Meals On Wheels In Trump's Budget", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2015 Though his budget director suggested last week that Meals on Wheels doesn\u2019t deserve government support, President Donald Trump\u2019s budget outline doesn\u2019t directly target senior nutrition services.\nThe proposal does call for the wholesale elimination of several antipoverty programs, including grants that in some states help fund senior nutrition programs such as Meals on Wheels.\u00a0But those grants provide only a small sliver of the overall federal support for senior nutrition, and an even tinier portion of overall funding for Meals on Wheels programs, which are largely funded by donations.\u00a0\nMeals on Wheels America, an organization that represents 5,000 home-meal delivery organizations around the country,\u00a0says that in the aggregate, these groups get about 35 percent of their funding from the federal government. Specifically, the funds are allocated by the Older Americans Act and distributed by the Administration on Aging within the Department of Health and Human Services.\u00a0\nThe Trump budget document specifies several federal programs that it wants to kill \u2015 including the Community Development Block Grant and the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program \u2015 but the budget doesn\u2019t say anything about Meals on Wheels or senior nutrition.\u00a0The proposal is silent about many federal programs partly because it\u2019s been billed as a \u201cskinny\u201d budget that the administration plans to follow with more details later this year.\u00a0\nNevertheless, when reporters asked Trump budget director Mick Mulvaney about Meals on Wheels last week, he didn\u2019t point out that the budget doesn\u2019t touch the program. Instead, he talked about Meals on Wheels as though he considered it an example of a questionable service funded by the Community Development Block Grant,\u00a0a $3 billion flexible funding stream provided to states by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. About 1 percent of block grant funds go to senior services.\u00a0\n\u201cWe can\u2019t spend money on programs just because they sound good. And Meals on Wheels sounds great \u2015 again, that\u2019s a state decision to fund that particular portion too,\u201d Mulvaney said. \u201cBut to take the federal money and give it to the states and say, look, we want to give you money for programs that don\u2019t work \u2015 I can\u2019t defend that anymore. We cannot defend that anymore. We\u2019re $20 trillion in debt.\u201d\nSome commentators have dubiously suggested Mulvaney was trying to criticize the block grant, not Meals on Wheels. In response to a request for clarification from HuffPost, a spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget stressed that Meals on Wheels isn\u2019t a federal program, despite the funding it gets.\u00a0\n\u201cIn fact, it\u2019s a program that\u2019s a truly American response to a need \u2015 neighbors helping neighbors\u00a0\u2015 and a praiseworthy effort,\u201d OMB Communications Director John Czwartacki said in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that some tried to incorrectly use this noble program to protect other wasteful and duplicative spending.\u201d\nThe Trump budget proposal does say that it would slash overall HHS funds by 17.9 percent, so it\u2019s possible that the senior services would eventually be targeted.\u00a0\n\u201cThe problem with a skinny budget is it is lean on details,\u201d Meals on Wheels America President Ellie Hollander said in a statement on Friday. \u201cSo, while we don\u2019t know the exact impact yet, cuts of any kind to these highly successful and leveraged programs would be a devastating blow to our ability to provide much-needed care for millions of vulnerable seniors in America, which in turn saves billions of dollars in reduced healthcare expenses.\u201d\u00a0\nPresident Lyndon Johnson signed the Older Americans Act in 1965 as part of the War on Poverty and the federal government\u2019s general effort to keep elderly people from dying in poorhouses.\u00a0", "date": "\n03/20/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/meals-on-wheels-trump_n_58cfe9d3e4b0ec9d29dd84e1", "tags": "meals senior \u201d trump skinny \u2015 programs federal program budget wheels"}
