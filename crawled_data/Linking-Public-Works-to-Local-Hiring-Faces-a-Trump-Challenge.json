{"title": "Linking Public Works to Local Hiring Faces a Trump Challenge", "content": "When the Chicago Transit Authority chose a Chinese joint venture to build the city a new fleet of rail cars for $1.3 billion, the manufacturer\u2019s vow to construct an assembly plant on the Southeast Side helped tilt the scale in its favor.\n\u201cThis is a classic win-win for Chicago,\u201d Mayor Rahm Emanuel said last year when he announced the contract and the 170 jobs that the factory would create, in addition to training programs and community hiring.\nTo Bombardier Transit Corporation, the losing bidder, however, the hiring sweetener was proof of what it called a \u201crigged\u201d and possibly illegal procurement process that denied \u201cjobs to fellow Americans outside of Chicago.\u201d In this case, it was referring to Americans who live in Plattsburgh, N.Y., and work at Bombardier\u2019s sprawling assembly and test center there.\nOver the last decade, more and more cities, on the coasts and in the heartland, have tried to leverage their buying power to fuel economic development through local hiring provisions on public projects that favor veterans, residents and low-income workers. But these efforts have been bedeviled by political, economic and legal challenges that have divided business, union and political allies.\nNow the Trump administration may rescind an Obama-era initiative that allows hiring preferences on transportation and construction projects in states like New York, California, Texas, Virginia and Illinois, a prospect that has alarmed advocates of such programs.\n\u201cWhy not let cities and states innovate to create the good American jobs that the administration has been clamoring for?\u201d said Madeline Janis, the executive director of Jobs to Move America, a coalition of faith, labor and other groups that want transportation funding to benefit local communities. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why they would want to cancel the program.\u201d\nLegal and regulatory hurdles have long frustrated officials trying to create job opportunities that favor local residents. The Supreme Court has ruled it is unconstitutional for employers in one state to discriminate against residents of another. Federal agencies, through Republican and Democratic administrations, have maintained that restrictions like competitive bidding prevent them from contributing a cent to public projects with hiring preferences. And state lawmakers, complaining that employers and workers outside the target city are at a disadvantage, have outlawed such preferences.\nJobs to Move America was one of several groups that spent years working with transportation officials in the Obama administration on a pilot project to test whether local hiring preferences reduced competition or drove up prices. In January, days before President Trump was sworn in, the Transportation Department extended the experiment, taking place in more than a dozen cities, for five years so that research could be completed.\nIn other areas, like education, Mr. Trump has chastised the federal government for imposing \u201cits will on state and local governments.\u201d This week, however, a Transportation Department spokesman said that \u201cthe prior administration\u2019s proposed rule and proposed long-term extensions of pilot programs is under review.\u201d\nThe agency\u2019s move troubled officials both within and outside the affected cities.\nIn Los Angeles, where $36 billion is committed to the region\u2019s public transportation projects, the Obama administration\u2019s pilot program \u201chelps L.A. multiply the benefits of federal transportation dollars, in a way that strengthens our local economy and gives our workers a chance to build new careers,\u201d said George Kivork, a spokesman for Mayor Eric Garcetti.\nCleveland, which is not a part of the pilot project, has been fighting for its own local hiring ordinance in the courts, Washington or the Statehouse since it was first adopted in 2003.\nThe city shaped the law \u2014 named in honor of a longtime councilwoman, Fannie Lewis \u2014 to avoid the constitutional objection to treating out-of-state contractors differently: The residency preferences applied only to construction hours worked by people from Ohio.\nCiting federal restrictions, however, the Federal Highway Administration still ended up using its discretionary power to withdraw funding for a project there because of the Lewis law. And in 2009 during the recession, President Barack Obama\u2019s transportation secretary rejected Cleveland\u2019s request to apply its provisions to the city\u2019s share of federal stimulus money.\nBut state officials argue that the ordinance puts Ohioans outside Cleveland at a disadvantage when compared with out-of-state workers and companies. The state\u2019s engineering companies association, for example, complained that such laws \u201crestrict the ability of qualified design professionals to engage in public works projects and compromise the quality of design on such projects.\u201d\nThe Ohio legislature passed a ban last year on local hiring provisions, similar to restrictions that exist in Tennessee and other states. But a county judge struck down the law eight months later after Cleveland sued, arguing that the city\u2019s home-rule rights were violated. The state is appealing that ruling.\nThe ban, Attorney General Mike DeWine of Ohio argued in his appeal, \u201cprotects construction workers from residency quotas\u201d like those that exist in Cleveland and Akron, and \u201callows construction workers to live where they want without losing out on available work.\u201d\nMayor Frank G. Jackson of Cleveland countered that cities often spend huge sums on development activities, but \u201cdon\u2019t necessarily see the benefits going back to their citizens, in terms of contracts and wages.\u201d\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t do this willy-nilly,\u201d he said of the city\u2019s hiring law. \u201cThis is just common-sense stuff.\u201d\nAccording to figures compiled by the mayor\u2019s office, one-fifth of all work hours went to Cleveland residents and 11 percent of those Cleveland hours went to low-income residents.\nOther cities have managed to walk the tightrope and establish programs. After Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans lawmakers hoped to make a dent in the city\u2019s staggering unemployment rate among African-Americans by requiring at least 30 percent of work on city construction contracts to be done by local residents; 10 percent of that was reserved for the disadvantaged.\nIn San Francisco, an ordinance eventually requires at least half of all work hours and apprenticeship hours on public construction projects to be done by people living in the city. And in Kotzebue, Alaska, public works projects have to \u201cmake a good-faith effort\u201d to ensure that residents make up at least 50 percent of the contractor\u2019s total construction work force.\nIn Indianapolis, where a public transit overhaul was approved a few months ago, advocates and officials are working to link the construction with a local employment and training program, but it is not easy.\n\u201cThere are still a lot of hurdles to navigate this issue, and we haven\u2019t figured any of this out yet,\u201d said Bryan Luellen, vice president for public affairs and communications at IndyGo, the city\u2019s public transportation corporation. Even though the bulk of the project may be financed with city money, he said, \u201cthe you-have-to-hire-locally piece is not something we\u2019re going to be able to do without special permission from the Federal Transit Administration.\u201d\nIn 2015, Boston chose the mammoth rail company owned by the Chinese government, China Railroad Rolling Stock Corporation, or CRRC, for a $566 million contract to build new rail cars in return for the company\u2019s opening a $95 million, 40-acre rail factory in East Springfield, Mass. But there is no federal money involved.\nChicago, too, chose a joint venture that includes CRRC, but managed to work around the federal restrictions with a strategy that Jobs to Move America helped devise. Although the transit authority could not give a preference to local hiring, it was allowed to take into account CRRC\u2019s promise to create 170 jobs in the United States as a whole. (The fact that they were being created in Chicago was not formally a part of the process.)\nBombardier, with existing plants in Pennsylvania and New York, objected, arguing that maintaining jobs elsewhere in the United States should have been given equal weight. After protesting first to the city and then to the Federal Transit Administration, Bombardier ended up withdrawing its federal appeal, said Maryanne Roberts, a company spokeswoman.\nIn March, CRRC broke ground on the new factory in Chicago\u2019s Hegewisch neighborhood. The plant will provide a local supplier of the city\u2019s rail cars for the first time in 50 years.", "date": "Aug. 3, 2017", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/03/business/economy/local-hiring-laws-public-projects.html", "tags": "public faces challenge hiring transportation city local linking trump \u201d federal jobs works"}
