{"title": "North Carolina Orders New House Race After Officials Rule GOP Win 'Tainted' By Fraud", "content": "The North Carolina Board of Elections on Thursday called for a new election in the state\u2019s 9th Congressional District after examining evidence of absentee ballot fraud on behalf of GOP candidate Mark Harris.\nThe five-member board, which consists of three Democrats and two Republicans, unanimously voted for the new contest.\u00a0In making the motion for a new election, board Chairman Robert Cordle said the election was \u201ctainted\u201d and pointed to \u201ccorruption\u201d and \u201cmess\u201d with absentee ballots.\nThe vote came after Harris, who had a 905-vote lead in the November race, abruptly said he believed a new election was warranted.\n\u201cI believe new election should be called,\u201d the candidate told the board earlier Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s become clear to me the public\u2019s confidence in the 9th District seat general election has been undermined to an extent that a new election is warranted.\u201d\nDemocrat Dan McCready, who ran against Harris, praised the ruling and urged supporters to donate to his campaign.\n\u201cFrom the moment the first vote was stolen in North Carolina, from the moment the first voice was silenced by election fraud, the people have deserved justice,\u201d McCready posted on his campaign\u2019s official Twitter page. \u201cToday was a great step forward for democracy in North Carolina.\u201d\nThe concession from Harris came after several days of testimony in which North Carolina officials laid out evidence that an operative working on his behalf had engaged in coordinated and substantial absentee ballot fraud.\nHarris, who testified all of Thursday morning, left the hearing immediately after calling for the new election. Noting he had been hospitalized for a recent illness that resulted in two strokes, he said he was not in shape to testify.\nThe North Carolina Republican Party said it supported Harris\u2019 call for a new election.\n\u201cThis has been a tremendously difficult situation for all involved and we wish him the best as he recovers from his illness and subsequent complications,\u201d state party Chairman Robin Hayes said in a statement Thursday. \u201cWe will continue to work with legislators and investigators on how we can improve the electoral system so that these kinds of situations can be avoided in the future. The people of North Carolina deserve nothing less than the full confidence and trust in the electoral system.\u201d\nNorth Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Wayne Goodwin issued a statement after the board\u2019s vote Thursday, saying, \u201cNorth Carolina Republicans, following Mark Harris\u2019 lead, repeatedly lied to the people of the Ninth district, silenced their voices, and undermined our entire state\u2019s faith in our democracy.\u201d\n\u201cThis saga could only have ended in a new election, and we look forward to repairing the harm dealt by Republicans and giving the people of the Ninth district the representative they deserve,\u201d Goodwin added.\nHarris did not admit to wrongdoing Thursday. The state GOP had previously demanded he be seated unless officials could show there were enough irregularities to sway the outcome of the election.\nBut during a multiday hearing, investigators with the Board of Elections said they had gathered evidence showing a political operative, McCrae Dowless, had illegally collected absentee ballots on Harris\u2019 behalf. A woman who worked for Dowless testified that she was paid to collect absentee ballots and instructed to take certain steps, which included opening unsealed ballots and filling in races left blank.\nIn remarkable testimony Wednesday, Harris\u2019 son John explained he had warned his father that Dowless was likely engaged in illegal absentee ballot activity. John Harris, now a 29-year-old assistant U.S. attorney in North Carolina, said he had examined the absentee ballot returns in Bladen County, where Dowless worked, in 2016 and noticed they were arriving in batches. That was a signal someone was collecting them and mailing them in. \nA key part of John Harris\u2019 testimony was a series of emails he had sent his father in 2017 warning that what Dowless was doing was illegal. Harris said he believed his father\u2019s campaign attorneys had turned the emails over to the state board and was stunned to learn that was not the case. The board obtained the emails when John Harris sat with it for an interview and brought copies, believing he was providing documents the board already had.\nMark Harris testified Thursday that he did not recall telling anyone he thought those emails would be private. But on Thursday afternoon, he said he had been made aware he told his other son just that. He said his illness was giving him trouble remembering things.\nHarris also downplayed his son\u2019s warning, saying he believed the younger Harris was blowing things out of proportion.\n\u201cI\u2019m his Dad, and I know he is a little judgmental and has a little taste of arrogance,\u201d Harris testified earlier Thursday.\nDuring his time on the stand Thursday, Harris said that after hearing prior testimony, he believed Dowless had lied to him when he said he didn\u2019t collect absentee ballots. He also agreed that the investigation into the irregularities was not political. \nIn addition to the absentee ballot issue, Kim Strach, the executive director of the state board, also suggested Harris may have broken campaign finance law. To retain Dowless, Harris wrote a personal check to an independent expenditure PAC. Those PACs are legally prohibited from coordinating with candidates or campaigns, but Harris testified Thursday he didn\u2019t know that was the case.\nDowless and others involved in the scheme could still face criminal charges.\u00a0\n\u201cThe N.C. State Bureau of Investigation criminal investigation into irregularities in the handling of absentee ballots in Bladen County is continuing,\u201d said Wake County District Attorney Lorrin Freeman. \u201cI commend the investigators and staff of the N.C. Board of Elections for their work in this matter. I anticipate their findings will be forwarded to my office for appropriate review and action.\u201d\nAt the conclusion of Thursday\u2019s hearing, Mark Harris\u2019 attorney reiterated that Harris had been lied to and did not know what Dowless was doing.\nThis story has been updated with statements from McCready and the Wake County district attorney.", "date": "\n02/21/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mark-harris-new-election-fraud_n_5c6f010be4b0e2f4d8a3f327", "tags": "officials thursday election win gop rule house \u201d absentee harris carolina orders race board new north fraud"}
