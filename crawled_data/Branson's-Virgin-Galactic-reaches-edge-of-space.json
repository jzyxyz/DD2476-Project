{"title": "Branson's Virgin Galactic reaches edge of space", "content": "The latest test flight by Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic successfully rocketed to the edge of space and back. \nThe firm's SpaceShipTwo passenger rocket ship reached a height of 82.7km, beyond the altitude at which US agencies have awarded astronaut wings.\nIt marked the plane's fourth test flight and followed earlier setbacks in the firm's space programme.\nSir Richard is in a race with Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos to send the first fee-paying passengers into space.\nHe founded the commercial spaceflight company in 2004, shortly after Mr Musk started SpaceX and Jeff Bezos established Blue Origin.\nIn 2008, Virgin Galactic first promised sub-orbital spaceflight trips for tourists would be taking place \"within 18 months\". It has since regularly made similar promises to have space flights airborne in the near future.\nBut delays and a fatal crash in 2014 prevented Sir Richard's original ambitions.\nOn Thursday, the SpaceShipTwo passenger rocket ship took off from the Mojave Desert in California.\nThe company said the space ship's motor burned for 60 seconds, travelling at 2.9 times the speed of sound as it gained height.\nThe rocket carried two pilots and a mannequin named Annie as a stand-in passenger, as well as four research experiments for NASA.  \n\"Today we have shown Virgin Galactic can open space to the world,\" Sir Richard said.\nThe US government has awarded astronaut wings to pilots who ventured farther than roughly 80km beyond earth's surface.\nBut Thursday's flight did not breach the 100km Karman Line, which many organisations use to resolve debates about where space begins. \nWhile the trip marked a milestone for Virgin Galactic, the firm's rivals have already ventured farther - albeit without humans on board.\nSpaceX, in partnership with NASA, is planning crewed missions for early next year. Mr Bezos has also said Blue Origin plans to send its first crew to space in 2019. \nVirgin Galactic, which is charging $250,000 for a 90-minute flight, has said more than 600 people have bought tickets or put down deposits for an eventual voyage.
