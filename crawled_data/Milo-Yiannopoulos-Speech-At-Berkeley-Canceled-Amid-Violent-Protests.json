{"title": "Milo Yiannopoulos Speech At Berkeley Canceled Amid Violent Protests", "content": "BERKELEY, Calif. \u2015 Violent protests on the University of California, Berkeley\u2019s campus forced school officials to cancel a Wednesday night appearance by right-wing agitator Milo Yiannopoulos.\nThe Berkeley College Republicans had invited the 32-year-old Breitbart editor and conservative provocateur, who\u2019s been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment, to address an audience of 500.\u00a0\nUniversity police said that a crowd of roughly 1,500 people had toppled light poles, started fires and hurled objects at officers before the event. Security had been heightened, as students had announced demonstrations against Yiannopoulos.\u00a0\n\u201cThe violence was instigated by a group of about 150 masked agitators who came onto campus and interrupted an otherwise non-violent protest,\u201d a university statement said.\u00a0\nAs the violence escalated Wednesday night, police placed the campus on lockdown and advised students to shelter in place, then ordered demonstrators multiple times to leave the area.\nThe university and its police department had placed \u201cdozens of additional police officers\u201d on duty and attempted to use various methods of crowd control, to no avail. \u201cIt was simply impossible to maintain order given the level of threat, disruption, and violence,\u201d the administration said in a statement.\nYiannopoulos styles himself as a free-speech libertarian, and under that guise peddles provocative commentary saying\u00a0\u201crape culture\u201d is a myth and transgender people have mental illnesses. \u00a0\nHis scheduled visit exposed the difficulty that Berkeley, like colleges across the country, has in balancing its commitment to freedom of expression with diversity and tolerance.\u00a0\nThe question is more potent for Berkeley, which prides itself upon the student-led Free Speech Movement that began in 1964 with students protesting against university rules that limited political activity on campus.\u00a0\nBerkeley Student Sai Dulla, 30, disagreed with the violence, favoring instead peaceful debate and \u201cfree speech.\u201d\nAllie Smith, 22, a Berkeley City College student, said the small numbers who committed vandalism tarnished an otherwise positive experience. As she spoke, a brass band played and a crowd danced.\n\u201cThis is what I came here for \u2015 people who want to be together,\u201d said Smith, who advocated\u00a0\u201ccreating safe spaces rather than meeting hate with hate.\u201d\nMembers of Berkeley College Republicans said the protesters trampled First Amendment rights.\n\u201cThe Free Speech Movement is dead. Today, the Berkeley College Republicans\u2019 constitutional right to free speech was silenced by criminals and thugs seeking to cancel Milo Yiannopoulos\u2019 tour,\u201d the group said in a statement afterward. \u201cTheir success is a defeat for civilized society and the free exchange of ideas on college campuses across America.\u201d\nStudents and faculty members demanded the cancellation of the event. In response, Chancellor Nicholas Dirks said last week that it\u00a0would be unconstitutional\u00a0to quash it based on anything that Yiannoplous might say. Only the Berkeley College Republicans could call off the talk, he said.\u00a0\n\u201cMr. Yiannopoulos is not the first of his ilk to speak at Berkeley and he will not be the last,\u201d Dirks\u2019 statement said. \u201cIn our view, Mr. Yiannopoulos is a troll and provocateur who uses odious behavior in part to \u2018entertain,\u2019 but also to deflect any serious engagement with ideas.\u201d\nYiannopoulos was\u00a0permanently banned from Twitter after inciting racist and misogynistic bullying of \u201cGhostbusters\u201d star Leslie Jones. He gained thousands of followers on social media as an anti-feminist during the Gamergate controversy, when male video game players targeted female game developers for harassment. Yiannopoulos\u2019\u00a0writing\u00a0arguably emboldened the subculture of gamers who complained there was a feminist conspiracy to make their pastime more politically correct.\u00a0\nCritics from Berkeley\u2019s faculty and students said Yiannopoulos lacks any intellectual argument worthy of an academic setting and that his tendency for harassment, such as his role trolling Jones, is not a meaningful way of exercising free speech.\n\u201cWhile the First Amendment protects him, he intentionally baits marginalized voices so that he can bully them and exploit the angry backlash in front of his fans,\u201d an editorial in the Daily Californian student newspaper said. \u201cIn inviting him, [the student Republicans club] demonstrates it is not a club dedicated to the preservation of free speech and open dialogue on campus. This is a club hiding behind the right of free speech as an excuse to legitimize \u2014 and even laugh at \u2014 hate speech and shirk responsibility for any resulting damage.\u201d\nControversy and mayhem have followed Yiannopoulos on his college tour this winter.\u00a0One man was shot in the abdomen at a protest outside of Yiannopoulos\u2019 event at the University of Washington on Jan. 20. A College Republicans club at the University of California, Davis canceled his appearance with \u201cPharma Bro\u201d Martin Shkreli after protesters blocked access to the venue on Jan. 14. He ridiculed a transgender student\u00a0in the audience and showed her photo during his University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee stop in December.\nSee more photos of the protest below:\nThis story has been updated with a statement from UC Berkeley and from Berkeley College Republicans.", "date": "\n02/01/2017", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/milo-yiannopoulos-speech-at-berkeley-canceled-amid-violent-protests_n_58911132e4b02772c4ea10d0", "tags": "free college protests speech canceled \u201d university republicans yiannopoulos violent milo berkeley amid"}
