{"title": "Apec summit ends without statement over US-China division", "content": "An Asian economic summit has ended without a formal leaders' statement for the first time because of US-China divisions over trade.\nPapua New Guinea's Prime Minister Peter O'Neill said \"the two big giants in the room\" had been unable to agree.\nHe said a chairman's statement for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit would be released later.\nThe US and China are engaged in trade war and revealed competing visions for the region at the summit.\nIn his closing comments, Mr O'Neill said Apec would try to ensure \"free and open trade\" in the region by 2020.\nDuring the summit, the US said it would join Australia in developing a naval base in Papua New Guinea (PNG), in an apparent move to curb China's growing influence.\nUS Vice-President Mike Pence said the base would help \"protect sovereignty and maritime rights in the Pacific islands\".\nOn Saturday Chinese President Xi Jinping took a swipe at the US's America First policy by saying that countries that embraced protectionism were \"doomed to failure\".\nMr Pence later said he was prepared to \"more than double\" the tariffs imposed on Chinese goods.\nHe also criticised China's massive Belt-and-Road infrastructure programme, warning smaller countries that \"opaque\" Chinese development loans led to \"staggering debt\".\nHe urged countries to work with the US instead, saying the US did not \"coerce, corrupt or compromise your independence\".\nMr Xi insisted that there was no \"hidden agenda\" to the Belt-and-Road scheme.", "date": "18 November 2018", "href": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-46252177", "tags": "us-china us division summit without china apec countries statement chinese trade economic ends"}
