{"title": "Facebook Says Cambridge Analytica Harvested Data of Up to 87 Million Users", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Facebook on Wednesday said that the data of up to 87 million users may have been improperly shared with a political consulting firm connected to President Trump during the 2016 election \u2014 a figure far higher than the estimate of 50 million that had been widely cited since the leak was reported last month.\nMark Zuckerberg, the company\u2019s chief executive, also announced that Facebook would offer all of its users the same tools and controls required under European privacy rules. The European rules, which go into effect next month, give people more control over how companies use their digital data.\nFacebook had not previously disclosed how many accounts had been harvested by Cambridge Analytica, the firm connected to the Trump campaign. It has also been reluctant to disclose how it was used by Russian-backed actors to influence the 2016 presidential election.\nAmong Facebook\u2019s acknowledgments on Wednesday was the disclosure of a vulnerability in its search and account recovery functions that it said could have exposed \u201cmost\u201d of its 2 billion users to having their public profile information harvested.\nThe new effort to appear more transparent about the data leaks \u2014 including a rare question-and-answer session with Mr. Zuckerberg and reporters \u2014 came just before Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s expected testimony next week on Capitol Hill, where he will most likely face criticism over how the company collects and shares the personal data of its users. Sheryl Sandberg, Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s top deputy, has several national television interviews scheduled for later this week.\nThe company said that on Monday it would start telling users whether their information may have been shared with Cambridge Analytica.\nAndy Stone, a spokesman for Facebook in Washington, said the 87 million figure was an estimate of the total number of users whose data could have been acquired by Cambridge Analytica. He said that the estimate was calculated by adding up all the friends of the people who had logged into the Facebook app from which Cambridge Analytica collected profile data.\n\u201cWe wanted to put out the maximum number of people who could have been affected,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg told reporters.\nIt remains unclear exactly how many users had their personal information accessed by Cambridge Analytica. The firm said Wednesday that it had licensed data for no more than 30 million users of the social network.\nFacebook also released a lengthy document describing how it would protect personal data in the future. In that document, Facebook said its search and account recovery systems had been open to abuse by anyone who already had some information about an individual, such as a phone number or email address. The vulnerability extended to much of the platform\u2019s user base before it was closed on Wednesday, Facebook said.\nThe company also said it would limit the types of data that can be harvested by software used by outside businesses. The changes mean that users will have to give permission before an app can collect information beyond their names and addresses.\nThe company also said it would no longer allow outsiders to use apps to gather information about the religious or political views of its users. And it will stop using third-party data from companies such as Experian and Acxiom to help supplement its own data for ad targeting.\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear now that we didn\u2019t focus enough on preventing abuse,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t take a broad enough view of what our responsibility is. That was a huge mistake, and it was my mistake.\u201d\nThe Federal Trade Commission is investigating whether Facebook violated a 2011 agreement meant to protect users\u2019 privacy. User data is crucial to the company\u2019s business, because it is used to deliver advertising to users.\nMr. Zuckerberg is scheduled to testify about the company\u2019s handling of sensitive user data before the Senate\u2019s Commerce and Judiciary committees on Tuesday and the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday.\n\u201cThis hearing will be an important opportunity to shed light on critical consumer data privacy issues,\u201d said Representatives Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon, and Frank Pallone, Democrat of New Jersey, of the House committee.\nSenator Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said, \u201cWith all of the data exchanged over Facebook and other platforms, users deserve to know how their information is shared and secured.\u201d\nFacebook\u2019s problems stretch back before the reports about Cambridge Analytica, to earlier investigations into how Russian actors infiltrated the platform by placing ads and posts to influence the 2016 election. Mr. Zuckerberg initially dismissed the idea of foreign interference on Facebook as a \u201ccrazy idea.\u201d\nSince then, the company has been the focus of investigations by law enforcement and congressional committees that are delving into the Russian influence campaign. Facebook now acknowledges that its platform was used to sway voters.\nAll those troubles have prompted investors to flee the company, and its stock has fallen sharply in recent weeks.\nIn response, the company has put its executives front and center.\nMr. Zuckerberg typically talks to groups of reporters only after the company releases its quarterly financial reports. But after not responding in public for several days following the Cambridge Analytica disclosure, he has given a series of interviews.\nAnd Ms. Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer and the second most recognizable face at the company, is set to be interviewed this week by Fox News, \u201cPBS NewsHour,\u201d NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show and Bloomberg. Ms. Sandberg will be interviewed remotely from California.\nFacebook said its new openness was meant to show that it takes the intense criticism over its handling of user data seriously.\nIn Washington, Facebook employees and public relations firms retained by the company have talked to regulators and congressional staff members about new privacy measures, including updates to policies that are intended to make them easier to understand.\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Zuckerberg provided a preview of what he will tell Congress next week. He said Facebook was \u201can idealistic and optimistic company.\u201d\nBut he acknowledged that the company had committed serious errors by not ensuring that robust safeguards were in place for users.\nAsked if he should still be leading the company, he said, \u201cYes. Life is about learning from the mistakes and learning what you need to go forward.\u201d\nTerrell McSweeny, a Democratic member of the Federal Trade Commission, said that Mr. Zuckerberg has a big task ahead of him in Washington.\n\u201cI think it is important for Zuckerberg to clearly explain how Facebook plans to earn back consumer trust,\u201d Ms. McSweeny said. \u201cConsumers need reassurance that their data are not being misused.\u201d", "date": "April 4, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/technology/mark-zuckerberg-testify-congress.html", "tags": "users company cambridge \u201d data facebook says analytica harvested million zuckerberg"}
