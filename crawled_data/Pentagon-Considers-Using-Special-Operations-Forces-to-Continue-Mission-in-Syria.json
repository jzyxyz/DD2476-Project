{"title": "Pentagon Considers Using Special Operations Forces to Continue Mission in Syria", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Pentagon is considering using small teams of Special Operations forces to strike the Islamic State in Syria, one option for continuing an American military mission there despite President Trump\u2019s order to withdraw troops from the country.\nThe American commandos would be shifted to neighboring Iraq, where an estimated 5,000 United States forces are already deployed, and \u201csurge\u201d into Syria for specific raids, according to two military officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\nThe strike teams are one of several options \u2014 including continued airstrikes and resupplying allied Kurdish fighters with arms and equipment \u2014 in a new strategy for Syria that the Pentagon is developing as officials follow the order Mr. Trump gave on Wednesday for a military drawdown even as it tries to maintain pressure on the Islamic State.\nThe Pentagon will deliver the options to Mr. Trump for approval within weeks \u2014 well before Defense Secretary Jim Mattis steps down at the end of February. Mr. Mattis resigned on Thursday, in part because of Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to overrule his senior advisers and withdraw troops from Syria.\nOfficials at the Pentagon said the plans sought to maintain American support for the Syrian Democratic Forces, a Kurdish-led militia of Arab and Kurdish soldiers who have proved to be the most successful ground fighters against the Islamic State.\nBut the local forces and their Western allies continue to be tested around the town of Hajin in eastern Syria, where the Islamic State is holding on to a last slice of territory. Though Mr. Trump has boasted about the Islamic State\u2019s defeat, the militant group has for months endured airstrikes and offensives by the American-backed Syrian fighters \u2014 and has even conducted deadly counterattacks into Hajin\u2019s surrounding districts.\nUnder the cover of a sandstorm in October, the Islamic State nearly overran an American Special Forces team and a group of Marines outside of Hajin, wounding two American troops, a third military official said.\nThe group tried the same tactic again in November, waiting for a sandstorm to mask its movements, and nearly captured Gharanij, a nearby town.\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo called the Trump administration\u2019s progress against the Islamic State \u201cextraordinary.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made the caliphate in Syria go away,\u201d Mr. Pompeo told National Public Radio on Friday.\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re very proud of that,\u201d he said.\nMr. Pompeo also spoke on Friday with President Barham Salih of Iraq about continued efforts to fight the Islamic State, said Robert Palladino, a State Department spokesman.\nTwo military officials said that the United States Central Command was planning to position a force across the border in Iraq that can return to Syria for specific missions when critical threats arise.\nDerek Chollet, a former assistant defense secretary in the Obama administration, said the Pentagon could \u201crename these guys, and call them a counterterrorism force.\u201d\nThe Pentagon did not comment on Friday about the options. In an earlier statement, Dana W. White, the Defense Department spokeswoman, said the American military \u201cwill continue working with our partners and allies to defeat ISIS wherever it operates.\u201d\n\u201cThe campaign against ISIS is not over,\u201d Ms. White said in the statement.\nIn 2014, when the United States began launching airstrikes in Iraq and Syria, the Islamic State controlled an area across the two countries that roughly amounted to the size of Britain. American Special Operations forces were deployed to Syria in October 2015.\nBy last month, the Islamic State\u2019s territory was reduced to the small pocket around Hajin \u2014 about 1 percent of the ground it used to control.\nLast week, the Syrian Democratic Forces retook the center of Hajin, forcing the militants to fall back to the town\u2019s outskirts. But the Islamic State\u2019s remaining hold on roughly 20 miles of territory has forced Defense Department officials to cull options for keeping what is left of the international campaign against the extremists from falling apart.\nThat will include weighing whether United States airstrikes can remain effective without American targeting guidance from the ground, and whether they would defend Kurdish forces only from the Islamic State \u2014 and not other militants.\nOfficials are also discussing whether the Kurdish-led force can fight without the weapons, ammunition and other supplies that will end once the American military leaves. Even allowing the Syrian Kurds to keep guns and heavy weapons provided by the United States would break the Pentagon\u2019s 2017 pledge that the arms would be reclaimed once combat ended.\nThe decisions are being prepared over the year-end holidays and will be made in the coming weeks, officials said.\nIn April, the Pentagon began building a rough withdrawal plan from Syria after Mr. Trump threatened to leave. At the time, Mr. Mattis and other officials convinced the president to dig in.\nBut even that plan called for a phased departure of troops from Syria \u2014 one that would take months, not within 30 days as is now being discussed.\nFrench and British Special Operations forces are expected to remain in Syria after the American troops leave, according to one official. But their different military tactics, combined with the loss of American resupply routes for food and ammunition, are expected to encumber the mission.\nThe British Ministry of Defense said in a statement on Thursday that \u201cmuch remains to be done, and we must not lose sight of the threat\u201d from the Islamic State.\nOfficially, there are 2,000 American troops in Syria. It is likely, however, that hundreds more are there in a mix of support units, Special Operations Forces, mechanics and engineers. All are part of a web of bases, outposts and airfields spread across the northeastern corner of Syria, a model similar to those in Iraq and Afghanistan.", "date": "Dec. 21, 2018", "href": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/21/us/politics/pentagon-syria-iraq-kurds.html", "tags": "forces considers syria american continue pentagon mr. military using operations state mission islamic special \u2014"}
