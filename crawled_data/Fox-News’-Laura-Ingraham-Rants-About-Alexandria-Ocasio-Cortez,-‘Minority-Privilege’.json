Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0(D-N.Y.) for criticizing her on Twitter.\nOcasio-Cortez wrote last week that Fox News had \u201ccrossed a line beyond conservatism and into outright bigotry\u201d with its financing of Ingraham and fellow host Tucker Carlson.\nIngraham in response railed against what she described as the \u201ccontinuing effort to beat everything into the ground as a racist offense\u201d in Thursday\u2019s episode of \u201cThe Laura Ingraham Show Podcast.\u201d\n\u201cSo, when you can\u2019t debate a point, you throw back \u2018white privilege, you can\u2019t understand,\u2019 and then there\u2019s nowhere for that person to go. You shut down debate,\u201d she said, and added: \u201cAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez is trying that little trick on Tucker Carlson and me.\u201d\nIngraham urged Ocasio-Cortez not to judge her, and then asked about \u201cthe privilege of being a protected member of a class that you can never criticize, lest you be called racist?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s privilege,\u201d Ingraham added in audio shared online by Media Matters. \u201cI think Victor Davis Hanson called it \u2018minority privilege\u2019 in his piece that he just wrote, that the people who are the most protected are the people who are the first to say \u2018white privilege\u2019 because then, you can\u2019t ever criticize them again.\u201d", "date": "\n01/18/2019", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/laura-ingraham-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-minority-privilege_n_5c418b75e4b027c3bbc0269d", "tags": "privilege \u2018 rants fox minority news alexandria host laura \u201d ocasio-cortez ingraham"}
