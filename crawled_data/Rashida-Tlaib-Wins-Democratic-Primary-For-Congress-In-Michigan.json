{"title": "Rashida Tlaib Wins Democratic Primary For Congress In Michigan", "content": "Former Michigan state legislator Rashida Tlaib\u00a0won the Democratic primary on Tuesday for a U.S. House seat in the state\u2019s 13th Congressional District.\nShe beat out five other Democratic candidates seeking to fill the seat of Rep. John Conyers, who\u00a0resigned in December amid allegations of sexual harassment. As the Democratic nominee in a district that has\u00a0historically voted Democratic \u2015 and with no Republican challengers \u2015 Tlaib is all but guaranteed a seat in Congress in November\u2019s general election. \nIf she wins the seat, she could be one of the nation\u2019s first Muslim women in Congress \u2015 she may be joined in the historic feat by one or more other candidates also running in 2018. Tlaib will, however, be the only one to claim the status of the first Palestinian-American\u00a0U.S. congresswoman.\u00a0\nBreaking barriers will be nothing new to the Detroit-born mother of two, who already\u00a0made history in 2008 as the first Muslim woman to serve in the Michigan Legislature. \n\u201cPeople think it\u2019s corny \u2015 I do want to change the world, and I want people like me to have a seat at the table,\u201d the daughter of Palestinian immigrants told HuffPost last month.\nTlaib is part of a\u00a0record wave of Muslim candidates running for office in 2018, alongside unprecedented\u00a0\ufeffnumbers of women running since Donald Trump\u2019s election \u2015 and part of a movement of progressive candidates seeking to push the Democratic Party establishment further left. \nTlaib, who grew up the eldest of 14 children, is running on a progressive platform, including support of Medicare for All and a $15 per hour minimum wage.\nShe was endorsed by the Justice Democrats \u2015 the progressive political group that backed Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York in her now-famous upset win. Like Ocasio-Cortez, Tlaib doesn\u2019t accept money from corporate PACs, and she told HuffPost she\u2019s \u201cgoing to\u00a0abolish ICE\u201d \u2015 a leftist stance that has gained traction among some leading Democrats\u00a0since Ocasio-Cortez ran on that idea.\nRunning in Michigan \u2015 a state with a significant Muslim and Arab-American community \u2015 Tlaib\u2019s candidacy comes at a particularly trying time for Muslim Americans. Over the past couple years, the Muslim community in the United States has faced\u00a0a spike in hate crimes amid Trump\u2019s campaign,\u00a0Islamophobic rhetoric and policies from the White House, and a Trump administration\u00a0\ufefftravel ban upheld by the Supreme Court that targets mostly Muslim-majority countries.\n\u201cPeople are ready for someone like me,\u201d Tlaib said. \n\u201cI\u2019m not talking about being Muslim, Palestinian, brown or a woman,\u201d she added. \u201cI vote the right way and go beyond that.\u201d", "date": "\n08/08/2018", "href": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/rashida-tlaib-congress-michigan_n_5b590275e4b0fd5c73cb6bea", "tags": "primary tlaib rashida candidates wins \u201d \u2015 muslim running democratic michigan congress seat"}
